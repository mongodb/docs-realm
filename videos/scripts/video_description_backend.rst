This is the first in a series of tutorial walk-throughs on building a MongoDB 
Realm Task Tracker app. In this video, we follow the steps for the [Backend Setup]
(https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/tutorial/realm-app/), which is subsequently 
used by each of the platform-specific tutorials.

There are 5 steps in this tutorial:

- 0:39 Create a new Atlas Account
- 2:18 Create a free Atlas Cluster
- 3:10 Install the [Realm Command Line Tools](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/cli/)
  (realm-cli)
- 3:43 Add an API Key for the CLI Tools
- 6:02 Upload a pre-built Realm app

Hi! My name is ...., and I'm one of the developer educators here at MongoDB. 

In this tutorial, I'll walk you through the first of the Realm tutorials -- the 
Backend for the Task Tracker app. This video follows the steps in the tutorial, 
so you can follow along as I walk through it.

There are 5 steps in this tutorial: we'll start by creating a free Atlas account,
set up a free Atlas cluster to hold our data, install and then configure the Realm 
command line tools, and finally upload a pre-configured backend Realm app. 

So let's get started.

First, open your browser and go to **account.mongodb.com**.
On the logon page, click "Sign Up". Of course, if you already have an Atlas 
account, you can skip ahead to the next section. On the next page, you can 
enter in your information, or -- if you already have a google account -- you can 
save time by logging in with that account. I'm going to go ahead and do that:

.. click "Sign up with Google" button, type in creds, etc.

Now that we have an account, let's set up a cluster. An Atlas cluster is 
managed service that is hosted in Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or 
Amazon Web Services. For this demo, we'll set up a free Atlas cluster in 
AWS.

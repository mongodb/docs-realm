Overview
--------
The following steps guide you through setting up a generic Realm application.

Prerequisites
-------------
Before you begin, you will need a `MongoDB Atlas <https://cloud.mongodb.com/user/register?jmp=docs>`__ account. You can learn more about creating an |atlas| account in the `Atlas Getting Started <http://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started>`__ documentation.

Procedure
---------
A. Log on to Atlas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use MongoDB Realm, you must be logged into `Atlas
<https://cloud.mongodb.com>`__.

B. Create an Atlas Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create an Atlas cluster to use with your MongoDB Realm app, following these steps:

1. In the left navigation pane, click :guilabel:`Clusters`, and then
   click the :guilabel:`Build New Cluster` button. The :guilabel:`Create
   New Cluster` page opens.

2. Choose your preferred provider and region, tier, and additional settings. As you build your cluster, Atlas displays the associated costs at the bottom of the page.

   .. note::

      Atlas provides a Free Tier M0 replica set as well as paid M10+
      clusters. Free Tier deployments have restrictions as compared to
      paid M10+ deployments but will work for the purposes of the
      tutorials we offer. For complete documentation on these
      restrictions, see `Atlas M0 (Free Tier), M2, and M5 Limitations
      <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/free-shared-limitations/>`__.

3. The default cluster name is :guilabel:`Cluster0`. If you wish to
change the name, do so now, as cluster names cannot be changed once
configured.

4. Click the :guilabel:`Create Cluster` button to save your changes.

.. note::

   For detailed information about the options available when creating an Atlas cluster, see `<https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/create-new-cluster/>`__.

C. Add a Realm App
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. In Atlas, click :guilabel:`Realm Apps` in the left-hand navigation.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Create New Application.`

#. In the :guilabel:`Create a new application` dialog, enter an
   :guilabel:`Application Name` for your Realm app.

   .. include:: /includes/note-app-name-limitations.rst

#. Select a cluster in your project in your project from the
   :guilabel:`Link to Cluster` dropdown. Realm will automatically
   create a MongoDB service that is linked to this cluster.

#. Enter a name for the service that Realm will create in the
   :guilabel:`Realm Service Name` field.

#. Select a :ref:`deployment model <realm-deployment-models>` and
   :ref:`deployment region <realm-regions>` for your application.

#. Click :guilabel:`Create`.

Upon creation of your app, you will be redirected to the MongoDB Realm
console. Your app is created with a MongoDB service named
:guilabel:`mongodb-atlas`.

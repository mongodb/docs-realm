.. note::

   If you do not specify a ``Content-Type`` attribute for a file, {+service+}
   will attempt to automatically add a ``Content-Type`` attribute to it
   based on the file extension.

   For example, {+service-short+} would automatically add the attribute
   ``Content-Type: application/html`` to the file ``myPage.html``.

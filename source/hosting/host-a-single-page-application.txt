Overview
--------

Many web applications built with modern frameworks, like React, Vue, and
Angular, are single-page applications (SPAs) that dynamically handle
routing and rendering client-side instead of fetching each rendered page
from the server. You can use Realm to host your SPA and serve it to
clients.

To host your app, you need to specify that it's a SPA in Realm. By
default, Realm handles requests for a given resource by returning the
file hosted at the specified resource path or a 404 if no file matches
the path. However, SPAs render in a single, specific HTML file so all
requests should return that file regardless of the requested resource
path.

This guide covers how you can configure Realm Hosting to redirect all
resource requests to a single file to support the SPA pattern.

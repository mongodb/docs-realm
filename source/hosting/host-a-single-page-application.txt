Overview
--------

Many web applications built with modern frameworks, like React, Vue, and
Angular, are single-page applications (SPAs) that dynamically handle
routing and rendering client-side instead of fetching each rendered page
from the server.

By default, Realm handles requests for a given resource by returning
the file hosted at the specified resource path or a 404 if no file
matches the path. However, SPAs render in a single, specific HTML file
so all requests should return that file regardless of the requested
resource path.

This guide covers how you can configure Realm Hosting to redirect all
resource requests to a single file to support the SPA pattern.

Overview
--------

Many web applications built with modern frameworks, like React, Vue, and
Angular, are single-page applications (SPAs) that dynamically handle
routing and rendering client-side instead of fetching each rendered page
from the server. You can use {+service+} to host your SPA and serve it to
clients.

To host your app, you need to specify that it's a SPA in {+service-short+}. By
default, {+service-short+} handles requests for a given resource by returning the
file hosted at the specified resource path or a 404 if no file matches
the path. However, SPAs render in a single, specific HTML file so all
requests should return that file regardless of the requested resource
path.

This guide covers how you can configure {+service-short+} Hosting to redirect all
resource requests to a single file to support the SPA pattern.

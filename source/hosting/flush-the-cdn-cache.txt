Overview
--------

{+service+} serves hosted files through a :wikipedia:`Content Delivery Network
(CDN) <Content_delivery_network>` in order to minimize the latency
between receiving a request for a resource and returning the requested
resource.

When a client requests a resource that's hosted in {+service-short+}, the CDN server
that processes the request checks for a cached copy of the file. If the
server finds a valid cached copy of the resource, it returns it to the
client. Otherwise, it forwards the request to {+service-short+} and caches the
returned file before returning it to the client.

The CDN caching process decreases the latency for end users when they
request a resource but may cause users to receive an out-of-date
version of a resource if the file has changed since the CDN server
cached it. You can *flush* the CDN cache in order to make it drop all
cached files and start serving the latest version of each file.

.. note:: Automatic Cache Invalidation
   
   The CDN automatically refreshes cached files periodically. You can
   configure the caching behavior for an individual file by adding a a
   :ref:`Cache-Control <metadata-cache-control>` attribute to the file.

Overview
--------

Realm serves hosted files through a :wikipedia:`CDN
<Content_delivery_network>` in order to minimize the latency between
receiving a request for a resource and returning the requested resource.
When a client requests a resource that's hosted in Realm, the CDN server
that processes the request checks for a cached copy of the file that it
can return instead of requesting a new copy of the file from Realm.

The CDN caching process decreases the latency for end users when they
request a resource, but it can also prevent them from receiving the most
up-to-date version of a resource if the file has changed since the CDN
server cached it. You can invalidate all cached files to force the CDN
servers to fetch new copies from Realm.

To flush the CDN cache for all hosted files, select the tab below that
corresponds to the interface you want to use and follow the procedure.

.. note::

   You can configure the caching behavior for an individual file by
   adding a a :ref:`Cache-Control <metadata-cache-control>` attribute to
   the file.

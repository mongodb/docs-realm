In traditional applications, an application server exposes an API to client
applications and handles database queries on their behalf. To prevent malicious,

database directly.

{+service+} provides a configurable and dynamic rules engine that enables you to
run a MongoDB query from client applications while transparently preventing

dynamically based on the :doc:`application user </authentication>` that issued a
query.

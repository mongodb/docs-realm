Overview
--------

An embedded object is a special type of :ref:`Realm object <node-realm-objects>`
that models complex data about a specific object. Embedded objects are similar
to :ref:`relationships <node-client-relationships>`, but they provide additional
constraints and map more naturally to the denormalized :manual:`MongoDB document
model </core/data-modeling-introduction/>`.

Realm enforces unique ownership constraints that treat each embedded object as
nested data inside of a single, specific parent object. An embedded object
inherits the lifecycle of its parent object and cannot exist as an independent
Realm object. Realm automatically deletes embedded objects if their parent
object is deleted or if they are overwritten by a new embedded object.

.. admonition:: Realm Uses Cascading Deletes for Embedded Objects
   :class: note

   When you delete a Realm object, Realm automatically deletes any
   embedded objects referenced by that object. Any objects that your
   application must persist after the deletion of their parent object
   should use :ref:`relationships <node-client-relationships>`
   instead.

Embedded Object Data Models
---------------------------

You can define embedded object types using either Realm object models or a
server-side document schema. Embedded object types are reusable and composable.
You can use the same embedded object type in multiple parent object types and
you can embed objects inside of other embedded objects. You can even recursively
reference an embedded object type as an optional property in its own definition.

.. important::
   
   Embedded objects cannot have a primary key.

Realm Object Models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To specify that a Realm object model define an embedded object, set ``embedded``
to ``true``. You can reference an embedded object type from parent object types
in the same way as you would define a relationship:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 3, 18, 28

   const AddressSchema = {
     name: "Address",
     embedded: true, // default: false
     properties: {
       street: "string?",
       city: "string?",
       country: "string?",
       postalCode: "string?",
     },
   };
   
   const ContactSchema = {
     name: "Contact",
     primaryKey: "_id",
     properties: {
       _id: "objectId",
       name: "string",
       address: "Address", // Embed a single object
     },
   };
   
   const BusinessSchema = {
     name: "Business",
     primaryKey: "_id",
     properties: {
       _id: "objectId",
       name: "string",
       addresses: { type: "list", objectType: "Address" }, // Embed an array of objects
     },
   };

Read and Write Embedded Objects
-------------------------------

Create an Embedded Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create an embedded object, specify it as a nested object when you define the
parent object:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 5-8

   realm.write(() => {
     realm.create("Contact", {
       _id: new BSON.ObjectId(),
       name: "Freddy Krueger",
       address: {
         street: "Elm Street",
         city: "Springwood",
       },
     });
   });

Update an Embedded Object Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To update a property in an embedded object, modify the property in a write
transaction using dot-notation:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 3, 6-7

   realm.write(() => {
     const contact = realm.objectForPrimaryKey("Contact", "5f0f302824ec9735fe19ecf8");
     contact.address.city = "New York City";
     
     const business = realm.objectForPrimaryKey("Business", "5f345ceaafbcc6c8e91bf2c3");
     business.addresses.push({ city: "New York City", street: "1 Wall Street" });
     business.addresses[0].city = "Boston";
   });

Overwrite an Embedded Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To overwrite an embedded object, set the value of the embedded object property
to a new object in a write transaction:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 3, 7, 9-12

   realm.write(() => {
     const contact = realm.objectForPrimaryKey("Contact", "5f0f302824ec9735fe19ecf8");
     contact.address = { city: "Chicago", street: "1800 N Clark Street" };
     
     const business = realm.objectForPrimaryKey("Business", "5f345ceaafbcc6c8e91bf2c3");
     // Overwrite a specific object in the list
     business.addresses[0] = { city: "Chicago", street: "2100 N Clark Street" };
     // Overwrite the entire list
     business.addresses = [
       { city: "Chicago", street: "2100 N Clark Street" },
       { city: "Indianapolis", street: "123 W Washington Street" },
     ]
   });

Query a Collection on Embedded Object Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use dot-notation to filter or sort a :ref:`collection <node-client-collections>`
of objects based on an embedded object property value:

.. include:: /includes/directly-query-embedded-objects-note.rst

.. code-block:: javascript

   const nycContacts = realm.objects("Contact")
     .filtered("address.city = 'New York City'")
     .sorted("address.street");

Overview
--------

:doc:`MongoDB Realm Functions </functions>` allow you to run serverless
snippets of code. MongoDB Realm Functions are useful for abstracting
away implementation details from client applications by doing things
such as reusing code-snippets to process data or dynamically performing
actions based on the current user, processing data, and more. You can
call MongoDB Realm Functions from the client SDK. The active user of a
given MongoDB Realm Function execution is the authenticated user that
called it. 

Call a Function
---------------

In the Node SDK you call functions as a logged in user with the
``User.functions`` interface. There are two ways to call a function:

- You can call a function as if was a method defined locally on the
  ``User.functions`` interface.

- You can call the ``User.functions.callFunction()`` method to call a function
  by providing its stringified name and a list of arguments.

.. note:: Link a MongoDB Atlas Data Source
   
   This example requires a MongoDB Realm Application with a :doc:`linked
   Atlas data source </mongodb/link-a-data-source>`. Replace the
   "<appId>" in the code block with your app id, available in the
   lefthand corner of the MongoDB Realm UI.

.. code-block:: javascript
  :emphasize-lines: 21, 22

   const Realm = require("realm");

   const appId = "<appId>"; // Set Realm app ID here.
   const appConfig = {
     id: appId,
     timeout: 10000,
   };

   async function run() {
     let user;
     try {
       const app = new Realm.App(appConfig);
       const credentials = Realm.Credentials.anonymous();
       user = await app.logIn(credentials);
 
       const numA = 2;
       const numB = 3;
       const myArgs = [numA, numB];
 
       const result = await user.functions.sum(numA, numB);
       const resultOfCallFunction = await user.callFunction("sum", myArgs); // alternate syntax to call a MongoDB Realm Function
       console.log(`Using the "functions.sum()" method: the sum of ${numA} + ${numB} = ${result}`);
       console.log(`Using the "callFunction()" method: the sum of ${numA} + ${numB} = ${resultOfCallFunction}`);
     
     } finally {
       user.logOut();
     }
   }
   run().catch(console.dir);
 

When you run the code sample, your output should resemble the following:

.. code-block:: none

   Using the "functions.sum()" method: the sum of 2 + 3 = 5
   Using the "callFunction()" method: the sum of 2 + 3 = 5

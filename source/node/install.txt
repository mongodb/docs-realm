Overview
--------

The {+service+} Node.js SDK enables development of applications using the
JavaScript and `TypeScript <https://www.typescriptlang.org/>`__ languages.
{+service+} on Node.js is best suited for writing server-side applications. Your
Node.js application could be one component in a wider stack that also includes
iOS and Android apps.

The {+service+} Node.js SDK is not suitable for front-end application
development.

- Due to limitations of the browser environment, it is not possible to build a
  browser-based web app with this SDK. For front-end web applications, use the
  {+service+} :doc:`GraphQL SDK </graphql>`.

- For cross-platform mobile app development using web frameworks, use the
  {+service+} :doc:`React Native SDK </react-native/install>`.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before getting started, ensure your environment meets the
following prerequisites:

- `Node.js <https://nodejs.org/en/>`__ version 10.x or later (including Node version 14) 
- Linux, macOS 10.8 (or later), or Windows 8 (or later)

Installation
------------

Follow these steps to create a Node.js project and add the
{+service+} Node.js SDK to it.

Internet of Things (IoT) platform such as the Raspberry Pi 2, 3, or 4
running Raspberry Pi OS (formerly Raspbian), follow the steps below:

.. include:: /includes/steps/install-node-iot.rst

Import Realm
------------

Add the following line to the top of your source files where
you want to use {+service+}:

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: javascript

      .. code-block:: javascript

         const Realm = require("realm");

   .. tab::
      :tabid: typescript

      .. code-block:: typescript

         import Realm from "realm";

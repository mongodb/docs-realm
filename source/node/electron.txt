Overview

This page contains information to get {+service+} integrated into your
Electron application quickly. To learn how to set up an Electron
application with Realm without using any additional frameworks, see the
:ref:`Electron set up <electron-setup>` instructions. If you have
already created an application using `Create React App
<https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html>`_ or are
interested in integrating a React App with Realm using Electron, check
out the :ref:`Electron with React set up <react-electron-setup>`
instructions.

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- :ref:`Created a {+app+} <create-a-realm-app>`

   {+service+} works with any of the officially supported Electron
   versions. We recommend using the latest stable release. To see the

Overview
--------

You can encrypt the {+realm+} database file on disk with AES-256 +
SHA-2 by supplying a 64-byte encryption key when :ref:`opening a
{+realm+} <node-open-realm>`.

Realm transparently encrypts and decrypts data with standard
:wikipedia:`AES-256 encryption <Advanced_Encryption_Standard>` using the
first 256 bits of the given 512-bit encryption key. {+service-short+}
uses the other 256 bits of the 512-bit encryption key to validate
integrity using a :wikipedia:`hash-based message authentication code
(HMAC) <HMAC>`.

Considerations
--------------

Storing & Reusing Keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must pass the same encryption key when opening the encrypted
{+realm+} again. Apps should store the encryption key securely.

Performance Impact
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Typically, reads and writes on encrypted {+realm+}s can be up to 10%
slower than unencrypted {+realm+}s.

Encryption and Realm Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can encrypt a :ref:`synced realm <node-sync-data>`. {+service+} only
encrypts the data on the device and stores the data unencrypted in your
{+atlas+} :term:`data source`.

Example
-------

The following code demonstrates how to generate an encryption key and
open an encrypted {+realm+}:

MongoDB Realm iOS SDK
=====================

The {+service+} iOS SDK enables client applications on the iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS
platforms to access data stored in local {+realms+} and interact with {+backend+} services
like :ref:`Functions <functions>`, MongoDB Data Access, and
:ref:`authentication <users-and-authentication>`. The iOS SDK supports both Swift and
Objective-C applications.

.. note::

   The iOS SDK does not support Swift or Objective-C applications
   written for environments other than iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS.

Get Started
-----------

To learn how to install the {+service+} iOS SDK library as a dependency to your
application, see :ref:`Install Realm for iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS <ios-install>`.

To get started quickly with some Swift or Objective-C code, see the :ref:`Quick Start
<ios-client-quick-start>`.

The Realm Data Model
--------------------

You can store a wide variety of data within {+realms+} stored on your device. With
{+sync+}, you can share updates to that data across client devices and {+atlas+}.

For information about the structure of data you can store in {+realms+},
see :ref:`Realms <ios-realms>`, :ref:`Objects
<ios-realm-objects>`, and :ref:`Relationships
<ios-client-relationships>`.

To learn about the results returned from {+realm+} queries, see
:ref:`Collections <ios-client-collections>`.

To gracefully update the schema to a new version at runtime, see :ref:`Migrations
<ios-client-migrations>`.

   Collections </ios/collections>
   Migrations </ios/migrations>


Work with Realm Database
------------------------

Once you have defined a data model for your application, you
need to be able to :ref:`write <ios-realm-database-writes>` and
:ref:`read <ios-realm-database-reads>` pieces of data to and from
your {+realm+}s.

To learn how to refine and sort the results of queries, see :ref:`Query Engine
<ios-client-query-engine>`.

For information about how to react to changes in {+realm+} data, see
:ref:`Notifications <ios-client-notifications>`.

For advice on how to safely interact with {+client-database+} across threads in an
application, see :ref:`Threading <ios-client-threading>`.

For additional security, you can also :ref:`encrypt a {+realm+}
<ios-encrypt-a-realm>`.

Work with MongoDB Realm
-----------------------

The iOS SDK also connects your {+service-short+} client application
with your {+app+}'s backend services, including Functions, Services,
Webhooks, {+sync+}, and built-in third-party authentication.

To get connected to your {+backend+} app, see
:ref:`Initialize the Realm App <ios-init-appclient>`.

You can also :ref:`access custom user data <ios-access-custom-user-data>`.

To learn how to connect to a {+backend+} app to call
Functions, query data in an instance of {+atlas+}, and synchronize data
in {+realms+}, see :ref:`Call a Function <ios-call-a-function>`.

To learn how to query for data in MongoDB remotely, see :ref:`Remotely
Access MongoDB <ios-client-remote>`.

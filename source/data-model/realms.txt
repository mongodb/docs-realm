Overview
--------

A **{+realm+}** is a set of related objects that conform to a pre-defined
schema and share user-level access permissions. {+realms+} may contain more
than one type of data as long as a schema exists for each type.

A {+realm+} allows you to partition data according to who uses it
and when they use it. Every {+realm+} stores data in a separate
:term:`{+realm+} file` that contains a binary encoding of each object in
the {+realm+}. You can automatically :doc:`synchronize {+realm+}
across multiple devices </sync/sync-overview>` and set up
:doc:`reactive event handlers </crud/notifications>` that
call a function any time an object in a {+realm+} is created,
modified, or deleted.

Comparison with Other Databases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The {+service+} data model is similar to both relational and document
databases but has distinct differences from both. To underscore these
differences, it's helpful to highlight what a {+realm+} **is not**:

A {+realm+} is not a single, application-wide database.
    Unlike other applications, which store all of their data in a single
    database, {+instances+} often split data across multiple {+realms+} to
    organize data more efficiently and to enforce access controls.

A {+realm+} is not a table.
    Tables typically only store one kind of information, such as street
    addresses or items in a store inventory, whereas a {+realm+} can contain
    any number of object types.

A {+realm+} is not a collection of schemaless documents.
    Application objects are similar to documents, but every object in a
    {+realm+} conforms to a defined schema for its object type. An object
    cannot contain a field that is not described by its schema.

Key Concepts
------------

.. _realm-schema:

Realm Schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **{+backend-schema+}** is a list of valid :doc:`object schemas
</data-model/objects>` that each define an object type that a {+instance+}
may persist. All objects in a {+realm+} must conform to the {+backend-schema+}.

Client applications provide a {+frontend-schema+} when they open a
{+realm+}. If a {+realm+} already contains data, then {+client-database+}
validates each existing object to ensure that an object schema was
provided for its type and that it meets all of the constraints specified
in the schema.

.. example::
   
   A {+realm+} that contains basic data about books in libraries might use a
   schema like the following:
   
   .. code-block:: json
      
      [
        {
          "type": "Library",
          "properties": {
            "address": "string",
            "books": "Book[]"
          }
        },
        {
          "type": "Book",
          "primaryKey": "isbn",
          "properties": {
            "isbn": "string",
            "title": "string",
            "author": "string",
            "numberOwned": { "type": "int?", "default": 0 },
            "numberLoaned": { "type": "int?", "default": 0 }
          }
        }
      ]

.. _schema-version:

Schema Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **schema version** identifies the state of a :ref:`{+backend-schema+}
<realm-schema>` at some point in time. {+client-database+} tracks the schema
version of each {+realm+} and uses it to map the objects in each {+realm+}
to the correct schema.

Schema versions are ascending integers that you can optionally include
in the {+realm+} configuration when you open a {+realm+}. If a client
application does not specify a version number when it opens a {+realm+} then
the {+realm+} defaults to version ``0``.

.. admonition:: Increase Versions Monotonically
   :class: important
   
   :doc:`Migrations </data-model/migrations>` must update a {+realm+} to a
   higher schema version. {+client-database+} will throw an error if a client
   application opens a {+realm+} with a schema version that is lower than
   the {+realm+}'s current version or if the specified schema version is the
   same as the {+realm+}'s current version but includes different
   :ref:`object schemas <object-schema>`.

.. _realm-permissions:

Realm Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **permission** is a boolean flag that indicates that a user is
authorized to access, modify, or manage a {+realm+}. Permissions are defined
individually for each {+realm+} and either apply to a specific user or
configure the default permission for all users that don't have
permissions specified on the {+realm+}.

All {+realms+} are private by default, which means that the owner has full
permissions and no other user has any permissions unless explicitly
granted by the owner or a user with manage permissions on the {+realm+}.

{+service+} supports the following permissions:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Permission
     - Description

   * - ``mayRead``
     - If ``true``, the user has read access to all objects in the
       {+realm+}.
       
       Read access does not imply write access, so a user may not
       be able to modify a {+realm+} that they can read.

   * - ``mayWrite``
     - If ``true``, the user has read and write access to all objects in
       the {+realm+}.
       
       Write access requires read access, so the ``mayWrite``
       permission also sets ``mayRead`` to ``true`` for the user.

   * - ``mayManage``
     - If ``true``, the user has read and write access to all objects in
       the {+realm+} and can set permissions on the Realm for other users.
       
       Manage access requires write access, so the ``mayManage``
       permission also sets ``mayWrite`` and ``mayRead`` to ``true`` for
       the user.

.. _realm-path:

Realm Path
~~~~~~~~~~

A {+realm+}'s **path** is a string that serves as the {+realm+}'s unique ID. The
path can also optionally include the ID of a specific {+realm+} user that
owns and manages the {+realm+}. A {+realm+} path determines the default read,
write, and manage permissions for its associated {+realm+}. There are two
types of {+realm+} path - *public* and *private* - based on whether or not a
path includes a user ID.

The following table describes the default permissions and syntax for
each type of {+realm+} path:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Realm Path Type
     - Description

   * - Public
     - A {+realm+} that does not specify an owner is a **public {+realm+}**. By
       default in a public {+realm+}, non-admin users have read-only
       privileges and admin users have read-write-manage privileges.
       
       Public {+realm+} paths begin with a slash (``/``) followed by any
       string that is not a {+service-short+} user's ID or a tilde (``~``), such as
       the following example:
       
       .. code-block:: text
          :copyable: False
          
          /someGlobalRealm

   * - Private
     - A {+realm+} that specifies an owner is a **private Realm**. By
       default in a private {+realm+}, the owner has read-write-manage
       privileges, all other non-admin users have no read or write
       privileges, and admin users have read-write-manage permissions.
       
       Private {+realm+} paths begin with a slash (``/``) followed by a
       specific {+service-short+} user's ID, another slash, and then a string, such
       as the following example:
       
       .. code-block:: text
          :copyable: False
          
          /user-id/someUserRealm
       
       .. admonition:: Use a Tilde to Represent the Current User
          :class: note
       
          You can represent the current user's ID by specifying a tilde
          (``~``) in place of the user id. This shorthand removes the
          need to manually interpolate the current user's ID when you
          refer to a private Realm.
          
          .. code-block:: text
             :copyable: False
             
             /~/someUserRealm

Summary
-------

- A :term:`{+realm+}` is a collection of objects that conform to a
  schema. It is not a single, application-wide database. There can and
  usually will be more than one {+realm+} per application.

- A :term:`{+backend-schema+}` is a versioned specification of the
  object types used in a {+instance+}.

- {+realm+} **permissions** define who can read, write, or manage
  the {+realm+} and apply to the {+realm+} as a whole.

- A {+realm+} **path** is a {+realm+}'s unique ID and indicates whether
  the {+realm+} is public or private.

Customize the Logs
------------------
On the Logs screen, you can do the following:

**Filter the log entries**
   Drop-down menus enable filtering by predefined types of log entry, the status 
   of entries. You can also specify a date range, filter by user ID, and show 
   only entries associated with a specific request ID. 

**Limit the number of log entries**
   In the text field with the placeholder text :guilabel:`Max # of Logs`, enter 
   the maximum number of results you want to display.

**Download the results**
   Click the button to the right of the :guilabel:`Apply` button to download the 
   log entries that meet your filter criteria (or all log entries if you haven't 
   specified any filters). When you click this button, a dialog appears confirming 
   the filters that will be applied and prompting you to (optionally) limit the 
   number of results:

Customize the Logs
------------------
On the Logs screen, you can do the following:

**Filter the log entries**
   Drop-down menus enable filtering by predefined types of log entry, the status 
   of entries. You can also specify a date range, filter by user ID, and show 
   only entries associated with a specific request ID. 

**Limit the number of log entries in the view**
   In the text field with the placeholder text :guilabel:`Max # of Logs`, enter 
   the maximum number of results you want to display on the page. If there are 
   more records beyond your limit, you will see a :guilabel:`Load More` button 
   at the bottom of the list of log entries.

**Download the results**
   Click the download button, to the right of the :guilabel:`Apply` button, to 
   download the log entries that meet your filter criteria (or all log entries 
   if you haven't specified any filters). When you click this button, a dialog 
   appears confirming the filters that will be applied and prompting you to 
   (optionally) limit the number of results. The resulting collection of log 
   entries is in a .zip file that contains a single JSON file.

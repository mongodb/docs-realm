Overview
--------

Service logs are created by whenever a user interacts with
:doc:`External Services </services>`. The fields present in Service log
entries are determined by the service that emitted the log.

MongoDB Atlas
-------------

:doc:`{+atlas+} </mongodb>` is offered as a first-class service
within {+service+}. Service log entries have the following form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
    "arguments": [
      {
        "collection": <collection>,
        "database": <database>,
        "query": <query document>,
        "limit": {
          "$numberInt": <number>
        }
      }
    ],
    "name": <action>,
    "service": "mongodb-atlas"
   }

   Function Call Location: <location>

   Compute Used: <number> bytes•ms

   Remote IP Address: <ip address>

   SDK: <sdk>>

   Platform Version: <version>

   Rule Performance Metrics:
   {
    "database.collection": {
      "roles": {
        "owner": {
          "matching_documents": 5,
          "evaluated_fields": 0,
          "discarded_fields": 0
        }
      },
      "no_matching_role": 0
      }
   }

          running on Mozilla Firefox:

          .. code-block:: none

              SDK: firefox v4.0.0

          .. code-block:: none

              SDK: android v4.6.0

   * - Function Call Location
     - The data center in which the function was executed.

   * - Rule Performance Metrics
     - A summary of the :doc:`roles </mongodb/query-roles>`, :doc:`schema </mongodb/document-schemas>`, and :doc:`filters </mongodb/query-filters>` applied to a return value. Provides the number of documents that a role applies to as well as the number of fields in those documents that Realm evaluated and potentially withheld.

Introduction
------------

Many modern applications use multiple external services to handle
complex use cases, such as messaging, analytics, and data management. Those  
services often send data back by calling an HTTPS endpoint. You can create 
HTTPS endpoints in {+service+} for these external services to send data to 
your app.

Create a New HTTPS Endpoint
---------------------------

To create a new endpoint:

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui

      1. Click :guilabel:`HTTPS Endpoints` in the left navigation. 

      #. Click the :guilabel:`Add An Endpoint` button.

      #. Enter a **route** for your endpoint. The route controls the
         URI suffix used to access your endpoint.
      
      #. Select the HTTP method used by your endpoint.
      
      #. Choose the function that your endpoint executes when it receives a request.
      
      #. Save the endpoint by clicking the :guilabel:`Save` button.
      
      #. Deploy your changes with the :guilabel:`Review Draft & Deploy` button in the draft
         banner at the top of the page.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli

      To use the {+service+} Command Line Interface ({+cli-bin+}), you first need 
      to install or update :ref:`to the latest version <realm-cli>`. 
      
      With the latest {+cli-bin+} installed, follow these steps:

      1. Pull down the latest version of your app by running the following:

         .. code-block:: bash
     
            realm-cli pull --remote="<Your App ID>"

      2. The :ref:`app structure <realm_app_structure>` contains an 
         ``http_endpoints`` directory that contains all of your app's 
         HTTPS endpoints as well as any pre-existing webhooks.

      3. Create a ``config.json`` file in the ``http_endpoints`` directory with 
         the following structure:

         .. code-block:: javascript
            :copyable: true
         
            [
               {
                  "route": "/httpserv/endpoint0",
                  "http_method": "POST",
                  "function_name": "endpoint0_function",
                  "validation_method": "NO_VALIDATION",
                  "respond_result": true,
                  "fetch_custom_user_data": false,
                  "create_user_on_auth": false,
                  "disabled": false
               }
            ]
         
         The following table explains each of the fields in the config file:

         .. list-table::
            :header-rows: 1
            :widths: 10 40
         
            * - Field
              - Value
            * - ``route`` (string)
              - The full path and name of the endpoint
            * - ``http_method`` (string)
              - The HTTP method that calling services can use to connect to this 
                endpoint. Valid values are "GET", "POST", "PUT", "PATCH", 
                "DELETE" and "*", the last of which indicates that all methods 
                are accepted.
            * - ``function_name`` (string)
              - The name of the function that {+service-short+} calls when the 
                endpoint receives data.
            * - ``validation_method`` (string)
              - Indicates how the endpoint validates the incoming request. Valid 
                options are:

                - "SECRET_AS_QUERY_PARAM", which requires a secret value in the 
                  query parameters
                - "VERIFY-PAYLOAD", which requires an "Endpoint-Signature" field 
                  in the header. For example, "Endpoint-Signature::sha256=<hex-encoded-hash>"
                - "NO_VALIDATION", in which {+service-short+} performs no validation
                  of the incoming request.

            * - ``respond_result`` (boolean)
              - Specifies if response contains the result of the associated 
                function. If set to **false** and the endpoint completes 
                successfully, the endpoint returns a ``204`` response with 
                no data in the body. 
            * - ``fetch_custom_user_data`` (boolean)
              - If ``true``, {+service-short+} queries the requesting user's 
                :ref:`custom user data <custom-user-data>` and, if it exists, 
                exposes the data as an object on the ``context.user.custom_data`` 
                property.
            * - ``create_user_on_auth`` (boolean)
              - If ``true``, {+service-short+} automatically creates a new user 
                based on the provided user credentials, if they don't match an 
                existing user. The authentication provider that corresponds to 
                the credentials must be enabled at the time of the request to 
                create the new user.
            * - ``disabled`` (boolean)
              - Enables (false) or disables (true) the endpoint.

      
      4. Once you've updated your app's configuration files, you push 
         them to your remote app. {+cli+} immediately deploys the updated 
         configurations on push.

         .. code-block:: bash
            
            realm-cli push --remote="<Your App ID>"


Migrate Webhooks to Endpoints
-----------------------------

You should plan to migrate your existing {+service+} webhook to HTTPS 
endpoints. You do this through the UI, which provides a single-click, 
one-time migration:

.. note:: One-Time Migration

   Once your webhooks have been migrated to HTTPS endpoints, you can not 
   convert them back to webhooks. 

1. Click :guilabel:`HTTPS Endpoints` in the left navigation. 

2. Click the :guilabel:`Convert` button.

3. Click :guilabel:`Confirm`.

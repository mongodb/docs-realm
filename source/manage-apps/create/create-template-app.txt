Overview
--------

You can get up and running with a {+app+} using one of our premade template apps. 
Template Realm apps bring together many of the building blocks available in {+service+}
and provide you with a prebuilt {+app+} that you can customize. 

Procedure
---------

If you do not yet have any {+app+}s set up in a project, you can enter the Realm tab of the your Atlas 
dashboard to see the template apps available and choose the one you want to start with.

If you already have one or more apps set up, you can click the 
:guilabel:`Create App From Template` button at the top right to see a dropdown menu 
that you can chose a template app from.

Once you choose the template app best suits your needs, you will be asked to configure 
some basic settings and then the app will be created automatically.

To start building an app without a template, you can choose :guilabel:`Build your own App`.

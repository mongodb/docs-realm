Overview
--------

You can get up and running with a {+app+} using one of our premade template apps. 
Template Realm apps bring together many of the building blocks available in {+service+}
and start you off with a prebuilt {+app+} that you can customize. You can create a 
template app in the :ref:`{+ui+} <create-a-realm-app>`, with :ref:`{+cli+} <create-app-cli>`,
or the :ref:`Admin API <create-app-api>`. 


Create a Template App
---------------------

.. tabs::
   
   .. tab:: Realm UI
      :tabid: ui
      
      Follow the procedure described in the 
      :ref:`Create a Realm App with Realm UI <create-a-realm-app>` guide, making sure to choose
      the :guilabel:`Create App from Template` tab in the :guilabel:`Create a new Realm App` step. 

   .. tab:: {+cli-bin+}
      :tabid: cli

      Follow the procedure described in the 
      :ref:`Create a Realm App with Realm CLI <create-app-cli>` guide and include
      the ``template`` flag followed by one of the allowed values: 

      .. include:: /includes/template-app-ids.rst
      
      .. code-block:: shell
         
         realm-cli apps create -n "<your new app name>" --template "<template to use>"

   .. tab:: Admin API
      :tabid: api

      Follow the procedure described in the 
      :ref:`Create a Realm App with Realm API <create-app-api>` guide, making sure to choose
      the :guilabel:`Template` tab in the :guilabel:`Create a new Realm App` step. 
      When calling the create endpoint you should include a request body that looks like this:
      
      .. code-block:: json
         
         { 
            "name": "<AppName>",
            "template_id": "<ChosenTemplateAppId>",
            "data_source": {
               "name": "mongodb-atlas",
               "type": "mongodb-atlas",
               "config": {
                  "clusterName": "<NameOfExistingCluster"
               }
            }
         }
         
Explore a Template App
----------------------

When you create a template app, you get certain functionality included, the 
specifics differ depending on the specific app you choose. a list of what is included can 
be seen in the :guilabel:`Welcome to Your Application` section that shows up when you 
navigate to your template app in the {+ui+}. You can:

1. Learn more about what your chosen template app includes.

2. Follow on screen guides for customizing your app.

3. Use the {+cli-bin+} to download the code for your app so you can build the frontend 
   (if one is included) and interact with the {+app+} through the cli. 

   If you already have {+cli-bin+} set up, you can use the {+cli-bin+} 
   :ref:`pull command <realm-cli-pull>` to download the code. Otherwise, click the 
   :guilabel:`CLI` button in the welcome section and follow the instructions that pop up.

   .. code-block:: shell
      
      realm-cli pull --remote <App ID> --template <Template ID>

   .. note::
      All the template apps except Database Triggers come with a frontend that uses
      the appropriate :ref:`{+client-database+} SDK <realm-sdks>`. The prebuilt app is a 
      todo app similar to the task tracker app introduced in the :ref:`tutorial <tutorial>`.

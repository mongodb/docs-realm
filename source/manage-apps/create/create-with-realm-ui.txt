Overview
--------

The following steps guide you through setting up a generic {+app+}. The
term ":term:`{+app+} <{+app+}>`" refers to the central {+service+}
backend instance for your mobile or web application.

Prerequisites
-------------
Before you begin, you must be a ``Project Owner`` in a 
`{+atlas+} <https://cloud.mongodb.com/user/register?tck=docs_realm>`_ account.
You can learn more about creating an |atlas| account in the
:atlas:`Atlas Getting Started </getting-started>`
documentation.

Procedure
---------
A. Log on to Atlas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use {+service+}, you must be logged into `{+atlas-short+}
<https://www.mongodb.com/realm?tck=docs_realm#atlas-form-container>`_.

B. Create an Atlas Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create an Atlas cluster to use with your {+app+}, following these steps:

1. In the {+leftnav+}, click :guilabel:`Clusters`, and then
   click the :guilabel:`Build New Cluster` button. The :guilabel:`Create
   New Cluster` page opens.

2. Choose your preferred provider and region, tier, and additional
   settings. As you build your cluster, {+atlas-short+} displays the
   associated costs at the bottom of the page.

   Be sure to select MongoDB version 4.4 for your cluster if you wish to
   use :term:`sync`!

   .. note::

      {+atlas-short+} provides a Free Tier M0 replica set as well as paid M10+
      clusters. Free Tier deployments have restrictions as compared to
      paid M10+ deployments but will work for the purposes of the
      tutorials we offer. For complete documentation on these
      restrictions, see :atlas:`Atlas M0 (Free Tier), M2, and M5 Limitations
      </reference/free-shared-limitations/>`.

3. The default cluster name is :guilabel:`Cluster0`. If you wish to
   change the name, do so now, as cluster names cannot be changed once
   configured.

4. Click the :guilabel:`Create Cluster` button to save your changes.

   .. note::

      For detailed information about the options available when creating
      an {+atlas-short+} cluster, see
      :atlas:`Create a New Cluster </create-new-cluster/>`.

C. Add a Realm App
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. In {+atlas-short+}, select the :guilabel:`Realm` tab.

#. If you are creating your first {+app+} in this {+atlas-short+}
   project, you will be shown all the :ref:`template apps <template-apps>`
   available for you to start with, and an option to start without a template 
   (:guilabel:`Build your own App`). 
   
   .. figure:: /images/template-apps.png
      :alt: Modal showing all available template apps to start building from.
      :figwidth: 600px
      :width: 600px

   If you have already created at least one {+app+}
   in this {+atlas-short+} project, you can choose to use a template for your
   new app or start without one.
   
   1. Click the :guilabel:`Create App from Template` button in the top right of the screen
      to see a dropdown menu with all the template apps and pick one that suits your needs. 

   2. Click the :guilabel:`Create a New App` button in the top right of the screen 
      to start without a template.
     
      .. figure:: /images/template-apps-dropdown.png
         :alt: Dropdown menu showing all available template apps to start building from.
         :figwidth: 600px
         :width: 600px

#. You will be shown a dialog where you can configure your {+app+}, including the: 
   
   - :guilabel:`Application Name`. 
     
     .. include:: /includes/note-app-name-limitations.rst
   
   - Linked {+atlas-short+} cluster. {+service+} will automatically create a
     :ref:`MongoDB service <mongodb-service>` linked to this cluster with
     the name "mongodb-atlas".
   
   - :ref:`Deployment model <realm-deployment-models>`. 
   
   - :ref:`Deployment region <realm-regions>`. 

#. Click :guilabel:`Create Realm Application`.

Upon creation of your {+app+}, you will be redirected to the
{+service+} console. Your {+app+} is created with a
MongoDB service named :guilabel:`mongodb-atlas`.

Overview
--------

As you develop a :term:`{+app+}`, you might want to share the
codebase with team members, make a backup, or work with a
version control system like Git. {+service+}'s export
functionality makes this possible.

Exported application directories use the same name as the {+app+}
and the application's ObjectId. Every configuration file must conform to its
:ref:`configuration file schema <app-configuration>`.

Output
------

Only entities that are configured in your application appear in your
exported application directory. See :ref:`app-configuration` for more
information on configuration files.

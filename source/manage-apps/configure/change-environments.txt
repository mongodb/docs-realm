Overview
--------

When you use multiple {+app+}s in your development workflow, you must 
set the environment for each app to reflect the appropriate stage in your 
workflow. Changing the environment in your {+app+} tells {+service+} which 
set of environment values to use.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`Realm App Environments <realm-app-environments>`

Procedure

   .. tab:: CLI
      :tabid: cli

      .. warning::

         If you're using :ref:`Automated GitHub Deploy <deploy-github>`, do not 
         update your {+app+} environment via the Realm CLI. Instead, push 
         your changes to the linked GitHub repository.
      
      .. include:: /includes/steps/change-environment-cli.rst

   .. tab:: GitHub
      :tabid: github

      If you're :ref:`using GitHub to version control your app <deploy-github>`, 
      use your regular development process to update the application environment.

      You can change the environment in the ``realm_config.json`` file at the 
      root of your app. Update the ``environment`` property to one of the 
      :ref:`supported environments <supported-environments>`.

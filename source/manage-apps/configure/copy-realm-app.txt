Overview
--------

You can make a copy of an existing {+app+}. You might want to copy an
application when:

- You use feature branches for development. Use a unique copy of the 
  {+app+} for each feature branch to avoid conflicts.
- You use a fresh copy of the {+app+} when running tests to ensure start state.
- You deploy the same app to clusters across regions using a :ref:`local 
  deployment model <local-deployment>`.

Procedure
---------

You can copy your application's configuration in two ways:

- With the :ref:`Realm CLI <deploy-cli>` 
- With :ref:`GitHub deployment <deploy-github>`

      .. warning::

         If you're using :ref:`Automated GitHub Deploy <deploy-github>`, do not 
         update :ref:`your {+app+} configuration with the Realm CLI 
         <deploy-github-make-changes-cli>`. Instead, push your changes to the 
         linked GitHub repository.

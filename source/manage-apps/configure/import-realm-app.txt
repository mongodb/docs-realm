Overview
--------

You can import and deploy an existing {+app+}. You might want to import an
application when:

- You use feature branches for development. Use a unique copy of the 
  {+app+} for each feature branch to avoid conflicts.
- You use a fresh copy of the {+app+} when running tests to ensure start state.
- You deploy the same app to clusters across regions using a :ref:`local 
  deployment model <realm-local-deployment>`.
- You prefer to develop locally when making {+app+} configuration changes.

How to Import a Realm Application
---------------------------------

In {+service+}, importing an application's :ref:`configuration files 
<app-configuration>` is tightly coupled with deploying the new application 
configuration. The process to import a {+app+} deploys it. When importing an 
application:

- If you want to import an application's configuration files into a different 
  app, you must remove the ``app_id`` from the ``realm_config.json`` at the 
  root of the application directory.
- You must import the complete application structure. You can't do a partial 
  import of only one file or a single field if you're only making a small change.
- Even if you're using :ref:`deployment drafts <deployment-draft>`, importing
  a {+app+}'s configuration files deploys the app. It isn't possible to 
  import updated configuration files without deploying the application.

You can import and deploy your application's configuration files via the 
:ref:`Realm CLI <deploy-cli>` or :ref:`GitHub <deploy-github>`.

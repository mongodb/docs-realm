Overview
--------

You can import and deploy an existing {+app+}. You might want to import an
application when:

- You use feature branches for development. Use a unique copy of the 
  {+app+} for each feature branch to avoid conflicts.
- You use a fresh copy of the {+app+} when running tests to ensure start state.
- You deploy the same app to clusters across regions using a :ref:`local 
  deployment model <realm-local-deployment>`.
- You prefer to develop locally when making {+app+} configuration changes.

Key Concepts
------------

In {+service+}, you can import an existing {+app+} by importing the 
application's :ref:`configuration files <app-configuration>`. The process 
to import a {+app+} also deploys it, even if you have :ref:`deployment 
drafts <deployment-draft>` enabled.

When importing an application:

- If you want to import an application's configuration files into a different 
  app, you must remove the ``app_id`` from the ``realm_config.json`` at the 
  root of the application directory.
- You must import the complete application structure. You can't do a partial 
  import of only one file or a single field if you're only making a small change.

Procedure
---------

You can import and deploy your application's configuration files in two ways:

- With the :ref:`Realm CLI <deploy-cli>` 
- With :ref:`GitHub deployment <deploy-github>`

If you need to include secrets in your imported +{app+}, refer to the 
:ref:`secrets migration documentation <migrate-secrets-to-imported-realm-app>`.

         If you're using :ref:`Automated GitHub Deploy <deploy-github>`, do not 
         update :ref:`your {+app+} configuration with the Realm CLI 
         <deploy-github-make-changes-cli>`. Instead, push your changes to the 
         linked GitHub repository.

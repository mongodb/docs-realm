Overview
--------

You can import and deploy an existing {+app+}. You might want to import an
application when:

- You use feature branches for development. Use a unique copy of the 
  {+app+} for each feature branch to avoid conflicts.
- You use a fresh copy of the {+app+} when running tests to ensure start state.
- You deploy the same app to clusters across regions using a :ref:`local 
  deployment model <realm-local-deployment>`.
- You prefer to develop locally when making {+app+} configuration changes.

Key Concepts
------------

In {+service+}, you can import an existing {+app+} by importing the 
application's :ref:`configuration files <app-configuration>`. The process 
to import a {+app+} also deploys it, even if you have :ref:`deployment 
drafts <deployment-draft>` enabled.

When importing an application:

- If you want to import an application's configuration files into a different 
  app, you must remove the ``app_id`` from the ``realm_config.json`` at the 
  root of the application directory.
- You must import the complete application structure. You can't do a partial 
  import of only one file or a single field if you're only making a small change.

Procedure
---------

You can import and deploy your application's configuration files in two ways:

- With the :ref:`Realm CLI <deploy-cli>` 
- With :ref:`GitHub deployment <deploy-github>`

      :tabid: Realm CLI

      .. warning::

         If you're using :ref:`Automated GitHub Deploy <deploy-github>`, do not 
         update :ref:`your {+app+} configuration with the Realm CLI 
         <deploy-github-make-changes-cli>`. Instead, push your changes to the 
         linked GitHub repository.

      .. include:: /includes/steps/deploy-cli.rst

   .. tab:: 
      :tabid: GitHub

      When you have enabled :ref:`GitHub deployment <deploy-github>`, you can
      import your application by updating the configuration files in the
      linked GitHub repository. 

      Make any additions, modifications, or deletions to the application 
      configuration files in the linked repository. Refer to the 
      :ref:`app-configuration` reference page and individual component
      reference pages for details on the structure and schema of your 
      application directory.

      When you are ready to import the app, commit the application 
      configuration files and then push them to GitHub:

      .. code-block:: sh

        git add -A
        git commit -m "<commit message>"
        git push origin <branch name>

      Once you successfully push your changes to GitHub, {+service-short+}
      immediately deploys a new version of your application that matches the state
      of the latest commit. Client applications will automatically use the newest
      version, so make sure that you also update your client code to use the new
      version.

.. include:: /includes/note-secrets-not-exported.rst

.. note::

   ``Export`` is the :ref:`v1 Realm CLI <realm-cli-v1>` command, and is an
   alias for ``pull`` in the :ref:`v2 Realm CLI <realm-cli-quickstart>`.  

Prerequisites
-------------

- A :ref:`properly installed <install-realm-cli>` copy of {+cli-bin+} that has
  been added to your system ``PATH``.

- A `{+atlas+}
  <https://www.mongodb.com/realm?tck=docs_realm#atlas-form-container>`_
  :atlas:`programmatic API key </configure-api-access/#programmatic-api-keys>`.

  to export a {+app+}.

Procedure
---------

.. include:: /includes/steps/cli-export.rst

Your application will be exported to a local application directory. If
you did not specify a path for the directory with ``--local``, it will
be exported with the same name as the application into the current
working directory.

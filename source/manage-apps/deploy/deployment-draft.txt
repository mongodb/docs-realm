   * - :ref:`{+ui+} <deploy-ui>`
     - Yes
     - Any changes you make to your {+app+}'s configuration in the {+ui+} will be 
       automatically saved as a draft which you can manually deploy, 
       unless you have disabled drafts in the settings.

   * - :ref:`{+service-short+} Admin API <deploy-api>`
     - Yes
     - You can use an `API endpoint <{+base-url+}{+admin-api-page+}application-deployment-apis>`__
       to create a draft, then use other endpoints to make changes and deploy (or discard)
       the draft.

   * - :ref:`{+cli+} <deploy-cli>`
     - No 
     - You make changes to configuration files locally, and :ref:`push <realm-cli-push>` 
       them once ready to deploy. once you confirm your changes and push, 
       a draft automatically gets created and deployed. 

   * - :ref:`Automatic GitHub Deployment <deploy-github>` or :ref:`CI/CD <ci-cd-pipeline>`
     - No
     - You make changes to configuration files locally, and push them to GitHub or any 
       CI/CD pipeline once ready to deploy. once you push, 
       a draft automatically gets created and deployed.

=========================
MongoDB Realm Web SDK
=========================

The {+service+} Web SDK enables server-side
client applications to access data stored in {+atlas+}
and interact with {+backend+} services like Functions and
authentication. The Web SDK supports both JavaScript and
TypeScript applications.

.. note::

   The Web SDK does not support JavaScript or TypeScript applications
   written for the Node.js environment or React Native mobile apps. For
   those use cases, you should consider the :ref:`Node.js SDK
   <node-intro>` and the :ref:`React Native SDK <react-native-intro>`.

To learn how to connect to the GraphQL API from a client application,
see :doc:`Connect from a Client Application
</graphql/connect>`.

To learn how to run queries and mutations from your preferred client,
see :doc:`Execute a GraphQL Operation
</graphql/execute>`.

For an example of how to run a query from a client application, see
:ref:`Run a GraphQL Query <grapqhl-run-a-query>`.

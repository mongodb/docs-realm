The Realm Web SDK lets browser-based applications access
data stored in Atlas and interact with App Services services like
Functions and authentication. The Web SDK supports both JavaScript and
TypeScript.

Web apps built with Realm use the :ref:`Atlas GraphQL API <graphql-api>`
or query data stored in Atlas directly from the browser.
Unlike the other Realm SDKs, the Web SDK does not support creating
a local database or using :ref:`Atlas Device Sync <sync>`.

.. kicker:: What You Can Do

Develop Apps with Realm Web
---------------------------

Use the Realm Web SDK with Atlas App Services to query MongoDB directly,
query a GraphQL API, invoke serverless functions, manage user authentication,
and more.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Query MongoDB
      :tabid: query-mongodb

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Configure Atlas App Services

            You can use the Realm Web SDK to query MongoDB Atlas data directly
            from the browser. Perform CRUD, aggregation, and listen for database changes.

            First, you must :ref:`create an App Services App <create-app-ui>`,
            set up :ref:`database rules <rules>`, and :ref:`enable user authentication
            <users-and-authentication>`.

         .. step:: Connect to an Atlas App Services App

            To access your App Services App from the browser, :ref:`initialize the App client
            <web-init-appclient>`.

         .. step:: Authenticate a User

            To authenticate a user, usee one of the :ref:`App Services authentication providers <web-authenticate>`.
            App Services includes custom JWT, Facebook, Google, Apple,
            anonymous, and built-in email/password authentication providers.

         .. step:: Query MongoDB

            Query MongoDB directly from the browser using your authenticated user.
            The user can only access data that they're authorized to.

            For more information, refer to :ref:`Query MongoDB <web-query-mongodb>`.

   .. tab:: Atlas GraphQL API
      :tabid: graphql-api

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Configure Atlas GraphQL API

            The :ref:`Atlas GraphQL API <graphql-api>` automatically generates
            a hosted endpoint with GraphQL queries and mutations based on JSON schemas
            for the documents in your database.

            Configure App Services Authentication with data access rules to
            control which users have access to what data.
            Configure the GraphQL API in Atlas App Services.

         .. step:: Connect to Atlas App Services

            To access your App Services App from the browser, :ref:`initialize the App client
            <web-init-appclient>`.

         .. step:: Authenticate a User

            To authenticate a user, usee one of the :ref:`App Services authentication providers <web-authenticate>`.
            App Services includes custom JWT, Facebook, Google, Apple,
            anonymous, and built-in email/password authentication providers.

         .. step:: Query the GraphQL API

            Query the GraphQL API using a GraphQL client from the browser.
            Authenticate requests with user credentials.

            Learn how to :ref:`query the GraphQL API with the Apollo
            Client <graphql-apollo-react>`.

   .. tab:: Build with Atlas App Services
      :tabid: app-services

      .. container::

         Call Serverless Functions
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

         You can :ref:`call serverless Functions <web-call-a-function>`
         from your client application that run in an App Services backend.

         Authenticate Users
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

         Authenticate users with built-in and third-party :ref:`authentication
         providers <web-authenticate>`. Use the authenticated user to
         access App Services.

The Realm Web SDK enables browser-based applications to access
data stored in Atlas and interact with App Services services like
Functions and authentication. The Web SDK supports both JavaScript and
TypeScript applications.

The Web SDK does not support creating a local database or using :ref:`sync <sync>`. 
Instead, web apps built with Realm use :ref:`GraphQL <graphql-api>` 
or the :ref:`Query API <web-mongodb-data-access>` to query data stored in 
Atlas.

.. note::

   There are SDKs built for :ref:`React Native <react-native-intro>`
   and :ref:`Node.js <node-intro>` which you should use when creating
   apps in these environments. Alternatively, you 
   can use the Web SDK for React Native or Node.js apps. For further instruction, 
   refer to :ref:`Install for Node.js <web-install-node>`.

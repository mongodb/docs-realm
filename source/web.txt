   Release Notes <https://github.com/realm/realm-js/releases>

The Realm Web SDK enables browser-based applications to access
data stored in Atlas and interact with App Services services like
Functions and authentication. The Web SDK supports both JavaScript and
TypeScript applications.

The Web SDK does not support creating a local database or using :ref:`sync <sync>`. 
Instead, web apps built with Realm use :ref:`GraphQL <graphql-api>` 
or the :ref:`Query API <web-mongodb-data-access>` to query data stored in 
Atlas.

.. note::

   The Web SDK does not support JavaScript or TypeScript applications
   written for the Node.js (server-side) environment or React Native
   mobile apps. For those use cases, you should consider the
   :ref:`Node.js SDK <node-intro>` and the :ref:`React Native SDK
   <react-native-intro>`.

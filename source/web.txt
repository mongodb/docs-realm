   Release Notes <https://github.com/realm/realm-js/releases>

The {+service+} Web SDK enables browser-based applications to access
data stored in {+atlas+} and interact with {+backend+} services like
Functions and authentication. The Web SDK supports both JavaScript and
TypeScript applications.

The Web SDK does not support creating a local database or using :ref:`sync <sync>`. 
Instead, web apps built with {+service-short+} use :ref:`GraphQL <graphql-api>` 
or the :manual:`Query API </web-mongodb-data-access>` to query data stored in 
{+atlas-short+}.

.. note::

   The Web SDK does not support JavaScript or TypeScript applications
   written for the Node.js (server-side) environment or React Native
   mobile apps. For those use cases, you should consider the
   :ref:`Node.js SDK <node-intro>` and the :ref:`React Native SDK
   <react-native-intro>`.

Overview
--------

Conflicts arise when two or more users make changes to the same piece of
data independently. This can happen due to latency between device and
server or loss of connectivity. In this event, {+service-short+} mergse
the changes according to specific rules that ensure all sides always
converge on the same result, even though their changes may have been
made in a different order. This is called conflict resolution.

{+service-short+}'s conflict resolution system guarantees that all
clients will eventually converge to identical states, which is called
:wikipedia:`strong eventual consistency
<Eventual_consistency#Strong_eventual_consistency>`. You have to be
aware of the rules to ensure the consistent results you want, but the
upside is that by following those rules you can have devices work
entirely offline and still converge on meaningful results when they
meet.

.. _rules-of-conflict-resolution:

Rules of Conflict Resolution
----------------------------

At a very high level, the rules are as follows:

Deletes always win.
  If one side deletes an object it will always stay deleted, even if the
  other side has made changes to it later on.

Last update wins.
  If two sides update the same property, Realm will keep the value from
  the most recent update.

Inserts in lists are ordered by time.
  If two items are inserted at the same position, the item that was
  inserted first will end up before the other item. This means that if
  both sides append items to the end of a list, will include both items
  in order of insertion time.

Primary keys designate object identity.
  If two sides both create objects of the same class with identical
  primary keys, they will be treated as instances of the same object.

Special Considerations
----------------------

Counters
~~~~~~~~

Using integers for counting is a special case. The way that most
programming languages would implement an increment operation (like ``v
+= 1``) is to read the value, increment the result, and then store it
back. This will obviously not work if you have multiple parties doing
incrementing simultaneously (they may both read 10, increment it to 11,
and when it merged you would get a result of 11 rather than the intended
12).

To support this common case, we offer a way to express the intent that
you are incrementing (or decrementing) the value, giving enough hints to
the merge that it can reach the correct result. You have the choice to
update the entire value or edit it in a way that conveys more meaning,
allowing you to get more precise control of the conflict resolution.

Strings
~~~~~~~

{+service-short+} treats strings as atomic values and does not merge
conflicts on a per-character basis.

.. _custom-conflict-resolution:

Custom Conflict Resolution
--------------------------

Generally speaking, the conflict resolution of {+service-short+} should
work for most purposes, and you should not need to customize it. That
said, the typical way to do custom conflict resolution is to change a
property type from string to list. Each side can then add its updates to
the list and apply any conflict resolution rules it wants directly in
the data model. You can use this technique to implement max, min, first
write wins, last write wins, or any other kind of resolution you can
think of.

Summary
-------

- {+service+} Sync implements a conflict resolution system to allow multiple offline writers to write simultaneously and still eventually converge on the same result.
- The conflict resolution system follows four rules: deletes always win, the last update wins, inserts in lists are ordered by time, and primary keys designate object identity.
- Counters and strings are special cases to be aware of in your client code.

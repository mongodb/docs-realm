Overview
--------

You can temporarily pause, permanently terminate, or re-enable {+sync+}
for your {+app+}.

You can temporarily :ref:`pause <pause-sync>` {+sync-short+} before pausing your 
cluster, and then :ref:`resume <resume-sync>` without resetting your 
{+sync-short+} configuration or losing {+sync-short+} metadata.

You can permanently :ref:`terminate <terminating-realm-sync>` and 
:ref:`re-enable <re-enable-realm-sync>` {+sync-short+} for troubleshooting, or
if you want to change your {+sync-short+} configuration.

.. _pause-sync:

Pause Sync
----------

You can pause {+sync+} for a period of time without disabling
it entirely. When you pause {+sync-short+}, you stop syncing changes between 
Atlas and your application. 

.. important::

   If you need to pause your cluster, pause {+sync+} first. Otherwise, you
   must :ref:`terminate <terminating-realm-sync>` and :ref:`re-enable 
   <re-enable-realm-sync>` {+sync-short+}, and perform a client reset.

Pausing {+sync-short+} rejects any incoming client connections. This means that 
pausing {+sync+} for your {+app+} stops syncing changes for all clients. To 
pause {+sync-short+} from the client side, using logic that situationally 
pauses {+sync-short+} during a session, see your preferred SDK:

      Node SDK <node-pause-or-resume-a-sync-session>`.

      Learn how to :ref:`pause or resume a {+sync-short+} session using the 
      .Net SDK <dotnet-pause-or-resume-a-sync-session>`.

After pausing {+sync-short+}, you can :ref:`re-enable it <resume-sync>`. 
Pausing {+sync-short+} maintains the configuration settings and all of the 
{+sync-short+} metadata. When you re-enable paused {+sync-short+}, your 
clients can reconnect normally.

However, if your :manual:`oplog </core/replica-set-oplog/>` rolls past the 
time that you paused {+sync-short+}, you must terminate and re-enable 
{+sync-short+}. For example, if you only keep 12 hours of oplog for your 
cluster, and you pause {+sync-short+} for longer than 12 hours, you must
terminate and re-enable {+sync-short+}.

Terminating and re-enabling paused {+sync+} for your {+app+} erases 
{+sync+} metadata and requires you to specify configuration settings again. 
Clients must perform a client reset when they reconnect after {+sync+} has
been terminated. For more information, see: :ref:`Terminate Sync <terminating-realm-sync>`.

.. _resume-sync:

Resume Sync
-----------

After you have paused {+sync+}, you can resume it to begin syncing again for
all clients. If your :manual:`oplog </core/replica-set-oplog/>` rolls past 
the time that you paused {+sync-short+}, you must :ref:`terminate 
<terminating-realm-sync>` and :ref:`re-enable {+sync-short+} 
<re-enable-realm-sync>`, instead.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

The process to resume {+sync-short+} is the same as the process to re-enable 
{+sync-short+}. However, when you pause {+sync-short+}, {+service+} preserves 
your configuration settings and {+sync-short+} metadata.  

To re-enable {+sync+}, follow the steps in the :doc:`Get Started with Sync
</sync/get-started>` guide. You can skip the **Configure Sync** 
step. 

Clients do not need to perform a client reset when reconnecting after a pause.

.. _terminating-realm-sync:

Terminate Sync
--------------

If you have :ref:`enabled Realm Sync <enable-sync>`, you may have to 
terminate and re-enable {+sync+} under a few different circumstances:

- An upgrade from a Shared Tier {+atlas-short+} Cluster to a Shared or Dedicated instance
- A move to an {+atlas-short+} cluster that is distributed across regions/cloud providers
- An upgrade to NVMe Atlas clusters
- An :manual:`oplog </core/replica-set-oplog/>` rollover
- A paused {+sync+} session on a shared tier cluster due to infrequent usage 
- Troubleshooting, at the request of MongoDB Support

.. warning:: Recovering Unsynchronized Changes after Terminating Sync
 
 Terminating and re-enabling {+sync+} prevents unsynchronized client changes
 from automatically syncing. To recover any unsynchronized changes, implement a
 manual client reset that handles this case in your client applications:

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

Terminate {+sync+} in your {+app+} to stop syncing data across
devices.

.. _re-enable-realm-sync:

Re-Enable Sync
--------------

After you have terminated {+sync+}, you can re-enable it. Re-enabling 
{+sync-short+} enables your {+app+} to begin syncing changes to Atlas again. 
After you re-enable {+sync-short+}, your {+app+} begins accepting incoming
client connections again. However, if a client had previously connected to
your {+app+} before you terminated {+sync+}, you must perform a manual client 
reset for that client to enable it to connect to {+service+} again.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

When you pause {+sync-short+}, {+service+} preserves your configuration 
settings, and you can skip the **Configure Sync** step. 
When you terminate {+sync-short+}, or when the :manual:`oplog 
</core/replica-set-oplog/>` rolls past the time that you paused {+sync-short+}, 
you must specify the configuration settings again.

To re-enable {+sync+}, follow the steps in the :doc:`Get Started with Sync
</sync/get-started>` guide. 

If you are re-enabling {+sync+} after you have terminated it, you must 
perform a manual client reset in your client applications:

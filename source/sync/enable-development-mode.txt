Overview
--------

Development mode allows you to define and update your app's schemas by syncing
objects from a Realm SDK. While enabled, Realm does not enforce any data access
rules and does not validate synced objects against existing schemas. Instead,
Realm maps every synced object type to its own collection and automatically
updates the collection schema to match the synced type.

.. important:: Disable Development Mode for Production Apps
   
   As the name suggests, development mode is an insecure development utility
   that is not suitable for production use. Make sure that you turn off
   development mode before you make your app accessible in a production
   environment.

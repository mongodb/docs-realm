Overview
--------

A **client reset** is an error scenario where a client application that uses a
Realm SDK must erase all local data and download a new copy of the data from
MongoDB Atlas before it can continue to sync data. Clients in this state may
continue to run and save data locally but cannot send or receive sync changesets
until the client reset is complete.

.. warning::
   
   The client reset process loses any unsynced changes even if they were
   successfully saved locally. To avoid data loss, you must manually back up and
   restore any unsynced changes when you :ref:`handle a client reset
   <handle-a-client-reset>`.

Client reset scenarios occur when the server's history is incompatible
with the client's history. The most common causes of client resets are:

- **Realm server crashes**: A server may restore from a backup that has an earlier
  version. A client reset for this scenario would reset the client to
  the earlier version and lose any changes that were saved on the client but not
  yet synced with the server.

- **Disabling and re-enabling sync**: Turning Sync off then on again in
  the Realm UI causes all clients to require a client reset.

- **Client/Backend schema mismatch**: If a client application attempts
  to synchronize with the backend while using a Realm Object schema that
  does not exist in the backend, that client must perform a client reset.
  This only applies in one direction: if the backend schema contains a
  Realm Object class not used in a client, that client will *not*
  need to client reset.

- **Client maximum offline time**: When a client has not synchronized with
  the backend in more than :ref:`client maximum offline time
  <client-maximum-offline-time>` days, that client can no longer synchronize
  unsynced local changes with the backend. The client must discard all
  local changes since the last sync and download the current status of
  the realm from the backend.

- **Destructive schema changes**: A :ref:`destructive change
  <destructive-changes-synced-schema>`, like changing a property type or a
  primary key, requires you to terminate and re-enable sync. This creates a new
  synced realm file with a version unrelated to the client's file. Because
  this scenario requires a new realm file, you can only handle client resets
  caused by destructive changes using the :ref:`manually recover unsynced changes
  <manually-recover-unsynced-changes>` strategy.

.. _handle-a-client-reset:

Handle a Client Reset
---------------------

The SDKs automatically detect the need for client resets. You
can handle client resets in your application using one of the available
**client reset strategies**:

.. note:: Destructive Changes Require Manual Recovery

   You can only handle a client reset triggered by destructive changes
   using the :ref:`manually recover unsynced changes
   <manually-recover-unsynced-changes>` strategy.

.. _discard-unsynced-changes:

Discard Unsynced Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning:: Discard Unsynced Changes Deletes Unsynced Local Changes Permanently

   The "discard unsynced changes" client reset strategy throws away any
   unsynced local changes. Do not use this client reset strategy if your
   application needs to preserve these unsynced changes.

The **discard unsynced changes** strategy automatically handles client
reset events without the need for app-specific logic. During a client
reset that uses this strategy, the client:

1. Downloads a fresh copy of the realm from the backend.
2. Uses a diff to bring the original (local) copy of the
   realm to the same state as the fresh copy.
3. Discards the fresh copy. The app continues to use
   the original copy of the realm with the diff applied.

The "discard unsynced changes" strategy has several advantages compared
to manual recovery:

- Your application can perform a client reset without writing any custom
  logic, other than specifying this strategy. You don't have to manually
  initiate the client reset or interact with the error object at all.
- Your application can perform this client reset without closing any
  realms, disconnecting from the backend app, or manual restarts. This
  means you don't have to write any logic to handle these situations.
- Application users receive notifications for changes as the local realm
  updates to match the state of the backend realm.

There is one major disadvantage to this strategy, however:

- There is no way to recover changes that have not yet synced to the
  backend at the time of the client reset. When this strategy uses a
  diff to bring the local realm to the same state as the backend, unsynced
  changes are permanently deleted and cannot ever be recovered.

You can use this strategy to resolve a client reset caused by anything
*except* a destructive schema change.

.. _manually-recover-unsynced-changes:

Manually Recover Unsynced Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **manually recover unsynced changes** client reset strategy gives
the app developer complete control over handling client reset events.
With this client reset strategy, you can choose to either:

1. Initiate the client reset immediately upon receiving a client reset error,
   after closing all realms.
2. Wait until all realms have been closed and the app connection is
   re-established. To do this, restart the app.

During a client reset that uses this strategy, the client:

1. Makes a backup of the original (local) copy of the realm.
2. Downloads a fresh copy of the realm from the backend. This fresh copy
   replaces the original local realm.
3. Provides a reference to the local realm backup and the fresh copy of
   the realm.

With the local realm backup and the fresh copy in hand, you can triage
and save local data by copying it from the local realm backup to the
fresh copy of the realm. Recovering unsynced changes is highly dependent
on your schema and application logic, so you may need to supplement
your schema with "last modified" timestamps for best results.

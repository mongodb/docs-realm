You can design schemas for your {+app+} directly in client code. The objects 
and relationships that you define in your application become the server-side 
document schema based on your SDK models. :ref:`Realm SDKs <realm-sdks>` 
give you language-specific tools to define and work with these objects.

You can infer schemas from your client object models by enabling development 
mode. Development mode is a {+sync+} configuration setting for your {+app+}.
When you enable Development Mode, your {+app+} can create or update your 
schema by reading your synced {+realm+} files.

Why Use Development Mode?
-------------------------

{+sync+} Development Mode enables developers to develop faster, and design
:ref:`schemas <configure-your-data-model>` directly in client application 
code.

Create Schemas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In practice, here's how the server-side document schema definition process 
works with Development Mode:

1. Enable Development Mode.
2. Sync {+realm+} files from your local {+client-database+}.
3. The objects in the files become the definitions for your schema.

After you have synced {+realm+} files to define your schema, you can view the 
schema, and you can also export your data model for any or all of the {+service+}
SDKs.

Update Schemas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Schemas change as applications evolve. Development mode isn't just for 
creating schemas. You can also make non-breaking changes to schemas in the 
same way. 

When you sync a {+realm+} file, {+backend+} maps every synced object type 
to its own collection. {+backend-short+} then updates the collection schema 
to match the synced type. 

When you later sync an updated object, {+backend-short+} automatically 
updates the collection schema. 

This lets you update objects in your client code as you develop your app, 
while {+backend+} updates the schema to match.

   For more information about modifying synced object schemas, including
   how to make breaking changes, see: :ref:`<synced-schema-overview>`.

Key Concepts
------------

.. _sync-development-database:

Development Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you enable Development Mode, you specify a database to store synced 
objects. {+service-short+} creates new collections in this Development Mode 
database for every type of synced object.

.. warning:: Specify Data Access Rules with Development Mode Enabled

   By default, enabling Development Mode before you have defined 
   permissions creates default permissions that allow any user to access 
   any data. If your application requires permissions during schema 
   development, you can :ref:`specify data access rules <sync-rules>` after 
   enabling Development Mode. However, to make changes to the schema,
   a user must have write access to all data.

.. example::

   Specify a Development Mode database of ``myapp``. Your iOS client has a 
   ``Person`` model. You sync a {+realm+} that contains an instance of the 
   ``Person`` object. Development Mode creates a server-side schema associated 
   with the model. The object syncs to the ``myapp.Person`` collection. 

   {+service-short+} continues creating new server-side schemas and collections 
   for each new object type. If you later add a ``Dog`` object, that object 
   will sync to a new ``myapp.Dog`` collection that {+service-short+} will 
   create.

.. important:: Disable Development Mode for Production Apps
   
   Development mode is a development utility that is not suitable for 
   production use. Make sure that you turn off Development Mode before you 
   make your app accessible in a production environment.

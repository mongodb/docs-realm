Overview
--------

You can create a schema for your {+app+} in one of two ways:

- :ref:`Create a Realm Object Model from a Realm Schema <create-rom-from-schema>`: 
  If you have data in your 
  `{+atlas+} <https://www.mongodb.com/realm?tck=docs_realm#atlas-form-container>`_ 
  cluster already, MongoDB generates a Realm Schema by sampling your data. 
  MongoDB Realm can then translate that Realm Schema into a Realm Object Model 
  to use in your mobile application. 

- :ref:`Create a Realm Schema from a Realm Object Model <create-schema-from-rom>`: 
  Alternatively, if you are developing mobile-first and do not already have 
  data in your {+atlas-short+} cluster, you can translate your Realm Object Model into 
  a Realm Schema for use with {+atlas-short+}. Regardless of the approach that you take, 
  when you configure both your {+atlas-short+} cluster and Mobile application to use 
  the respective data model, changes to the data model between the server 
  and client are auto-updated.

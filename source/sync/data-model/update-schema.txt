Overview
--------

When developing an application using {+sync+}, you may need to make changes to
your schema at some point, such as when you: 

- Need to add a new property to an already-synced object
- Decide to change the type stored in a property
- Have to change an optional property to *required* 

To make it easier to understand how schema changes affect your app, we
characterize them as "breaking" versus "non-breaking" changes.

The {+service-short+} APIs provide for non-breaking schema changes to synced 
realms, allowing old clients to sync with newer ones.

Breaking schema changes, however, take some planning and work, and should
be avoided whenever possible.

Breaking schema changes are difficult because older clients (those that 
have not been updated to your new code and schema) still need access to 
the data via the old schema definition. Clients that are updated need to 
work with the new schema changes.

.. note:: Make breaking changes via the Realm UI

   Because breaking or destructive schema changes require special handling, 
   Realm does not support making these changes via Realm CLI or automated 
   deploy with GitHub. Instead, you should make breaking changes in 
   the Realm UI.

Breaking vs. Non-Breaking Change Quick Reference
------------------------------------------------

A breaking change is a change that you can make in your server-side
schema that requires additional action to handle. Failing to handle these 
changes properly can result in clients being unable to open a realm, or
the appearance of data loss when server-side documents are unable to 
sync to client-side applications.

A non-breaking change is a change that you can make in your server-side
schema or your object model without requiring additional handling in your
app. Realm refers to these types of non-breaking changes as additive changes.
They apply automatically to synced {+realms+}; you can make these 
non-breaking schema changes with no additional client-side configuration 
changes.

.. note:: Applying non-breaking changes to the client may require migration

   When you *only* make non-breaking changes to the server-side schema, 
   no additional action is required. However, if you then try to apply 
   these changes to your client object model, you may need to perform 
   a migration. If the client device has an existing realm file, you must
   perform a migration. For details, see the Modify an Object Schema
   page in your preferred SDK.

This table shows whether each type of change is breaking or non-breaking
when you make it only in the server-side schema or in the object model.
Some changes that are non-breaking on the client-side are breaking on
the server-side. Additionally, some changes that are non-breaking on the
server-side schema may require additional handling when you apply them to 
the client-side object model. For more details, see relevant sections below.

Add a Class
-----------

You can add a class to either the server-side schema or the client object 
model without doing any additional handling. 

If you want to add a class to both the server-side schema and the client
object model, you can add the class to the object model, and use 
:ref:`Development Mode <enable-development-mode>` to let Realm infer the 
server-side schema updates. Or you can manually add the class to both the 
model and the schema.

If you already have a client-side realm file that contains data, you must
increment the client schema version when you open the realm. For more 
information, see your preferred SDK's migration page.

Add a Required Property
-----------------------

You can add a required property to either the server-side schema or the 
client object model without doing any additional handling. 

If you want to add a required property to both the server-side schema and 
the client object model, you can add the required property to the object 
model, and use :ref:`Development Mode <enable-development-mode>` to let 
Realm infer the server-side schema updates. Or you can manually add the 
required property to both the model and the schema.

If you already have a client-side realm file that contains data, you must
increment the client schema version when you open the realm. For more 
information, see your preferred SDK's migration page.

Add an Optional Property
------------------------

You can add an optional property to either the server-side schema or the 
client object model without doing any additional handling. 

If you want to add an optional property to both the server-side schema and 
the client object model, you can add the optional property to the object 
model, and use :ref:`Development Mode <enable-development-mode>` to let 
Realm infer the server-side schema updates. Or you can manually add the 
optional property to both the model and the schema.

If you already have a client-side realm file that contains data, you must
increment the client schema version when you open the realm. For more 
information, see your preferred SDK's migration page.

Remove a Required Property
--------------------------

If you remove a required property from the server-side schema, this is
a breaking or destructive change. However, you can remove a required 
property from the object model as a non-breaking change.

A breaking server-side schema change requires you to :ref:`terminate sync 
<terminating-realm-sync>` in the backend, and then :ref:`re-enable 
<enable-sync>` sync. This triggers a :ref:`client reset <client-resets>`, 
which can result in client-side data loss. As a result, we do not recommend
making breaking server-side schema changes.

Instead, you can remove the property from the client-side object model and 
leave it in place on the server-side schema. 

To maintain backward compatibility, removing a property from a client-side 
object model does not delete the property from the database. Instead, 
new objects retain the removed property, but Realm automatically sets the 
property's value to ``null``. Realm sets properties that are non-nullable to an
appropriate empty value, such as a 0 for integer values or an empty string
for string values. This is considered a non-breaking or additive change
to the object model.

If you already have a client-side realm file that contains data, you must
increment the client schema version when you open the realm. For more 
information, see your preferred SDK's migration page.

Remove an Optional Property
---------------------------

If you remove an optional property from the server-side schema, this is
a breaking or destructive change. However, you can remove an optional 
property from the object model as a non-breaking change.

A breaking server-side schema change requires you to :ref:`terminate sync 
<terminating-realm-sync>` in the backend, and then :ref:`re-enable 
<enable-sync>` sync. This triggers a :ref:`client reset <client-resets>`, 
which can result in client-side data loss. As a result, we do not recommend
making breaking server-side schema changes.

Instead, you can remove the property from the client-side object model and 
leave it in place on the server-side schema. 

To maintain backward compatibility, removing a property from a client-side 
object model does not delete the property from the database. Instead, 
new objects retain the removed property, but Realm automatically sets the 
property's value to ``null``. Realm sets properties that are non-nullable to an
appropriate empty value, such as a 0 for integer values or an empty string
for string values. This is considered a non-breaking or additive change
to the object model.

If you already have a client-side realm file that contains data, you must
increment the client schema version when you open the realm. For more 
information, see your preferred SDK's migration page.

Remove a Class
--------------

If you remove a class from the server-side schema, this is a breaking or 
destructive change. However, you can remove a class from the object model 
as a non-breaking change.

A breaking server-side schema change requires you to :ref:`terminate sync 
<terminating-realm-sync>` in the backend, and then :ref:`re-enable 
<enable-sync>` sync. This triggers a :ref:`client reset <client-resets>`, 
which can result in client-side data loss. As a result, we do not recommend
making breaking server-side schema changes.

Instead, you can remove the class from the client-side object model and 
leave it in place on the server-side schema. 

If you already have a client-side realm file that contains data, you must
increment the client schema version when you open the realm. For more 
information, see your preferred SDK's migration page.

Change Property Type but Keep the Name
--------------------------------------

If you change a property's type while keeping the name, this is a breaking 
or destructive change to both the server-side schema and the client-side 
object model.

A breaking server-side schema change requires you to :ref:`terminate sync 
<terminating-realm-sync>` in the backend, and then :ref:`re-enable 
<enable-sync>` sync. This triggers a :ref:`client reset <client-resets>`, 
which can result in client-side data loss. As a result, we do not recommend
making breaking server-side schema changes.

Instead, you can let the existing collection remain in place with the 
existing schema, and create a partner collection with the new schema. 

A partner collection is a collection that contains the same data as
the original collection, but has the new schema definition in place. Partner
collections use database triggers to ensure that data flows in both directions,
meaning that when one collection is written to, the other is also written to 
(with the data modifications required for the new schema).

To implement a breaking schema change using the partner collection strategy, 
see :ref:`<migrate-schema-partner-collection>`.

If you already have a client-side realm file that contains data when you
implement a schema change using the partner collection strategy, you must
perform a migration when you open the realm. For more information, see your 
preferred SDK's migration page.

If you choose to terminate and re-enable sync instead of using the partner
collection strategy to resolve this type of breaking change, you must 
manually update the schema. :ref:`Development Mode <enable-development-mode>` 
does not automatically update your schema for breaking changes.

Additionally, if you choose to terminate and re-enable sync, you must update 
existing Atlas documents to enable them to Sync with your client applications. 
Without this additional handling, those documents do not Sync and it may 
appear in the client that the data has been lost.

If an Atlas document maintains the old property type, the entire document no 
longer syncs to the client application. You could resolve this issue in a 
few ways:

- Change the old field type on each document to match the new schema
- Add a new field to each document with a type that matches the new schema, 
  and copy the value from the old field into it, transforming its type

After you've made these changes, the appropriate documents should once again 
sync to the client application.

Change Property Name
--------------------

If you change a property's name, this is a breaking or destructive change 
to both the server-side schema and the client-side object model.

A breaking server-side schema change requires you to :ref:`terminate sync 
<terminating-realm-sync>` in the backend, and then :ref:`re-enable 
<enable-sync>` sync. This triggers a :ref:`client reset <client-resets>`, 
which can result in client-side data loss. As a result, we do not recommend
making breaking server-side schema changes.

Instead, you can let the existing collection remain in place with the 
existing schema, and create a partner collection with the new schema. 

A partner collection is a collection that contains the same data as
the original collection, but has the new schema definition in place. Partner
collections use database triggers to ensure that data flows in both directions,
meaning that when one collection is written to, the other is also written to 
(with the data modifications required for the new schema).

To implement a breaking schema change using the partner collection strategy, 
see :ref:`<migrate-schema-partner-collection>`.

If you already have a client-side realm file that contains data when you
implement a schema change using the partner collection strategy, you must
perform a migration when you open the realm. For more information, see your 
preferred SDK's migration page.

If you choose to terminate and re-enable sync instead of using the partner
collection strategy to resolve this type of breaking change, you must 
manually update the schema. :ref:`Development Mode <enable-development-mode>` 
does not automatically update your schema for breaking changes.

Additionally, if you choose to terminate and re-enable sync, you must update 
existing Atlas documents to enable them to Sync with your client applications. 
Without this additional handling, those documents do not Sync and it may 
appear in the client that the data has been lost.

If an Atlas document maintains the old property name, the entire document no 
longer syncs to the client application. You could resolve this issue in a 
few ways:

- Change the old field name on each document to match the new schema
- Add a new field to each document with a name that matches the new schema, 
  and copy the value from the old field into it

After you've made these changes, the appropriate documents should once again 
sync to the client application.

Change Property from Optional to Required
-----------------------------------------

If you change a property from optional to required, this is a breaking or 
destructive change to both the server-side schema and the client-side object 
model.

A breaking server-side schema change requires you to :ref:`terminate sync 
<terminating-realm-sync>` in the backend, and then :ref:`re-enable 
<enable-sync>` sync. This triggers a :ref:`client reset <client-resets>`, 
which can result in client-side data loss. As a result, we do not recommend
making breaking server-side schema changes.

Instead, you can let the existing collection remain in place with the 
existing schema, and create a partner collection with the new schema. 

A partner collection is a collection that contains the same data as
the original collection, but has the new schema definition in place. Partner
collections use database triggers to ensure that data flows in both directions,
meaning that when one collection is written to, the other is also written to 
(with the data modifications required for the new schema).

collection strategy to resolve this type of breaking change, you must 
manually update the schema. :ref:`Development Mode <enable-development-mode>` 
does not automatically update your schema for breaking changes.

Change Property from Required to Optional
-----------------------------------------

If you change a property from required to optional, this is a breaking or 
destructive change to both the server-side schema and the client-side object 
model.

A breaking server-side schema change requires you to :ref:`terminate sync 
<terminating-realm-sync>` in the backend, and then :ref:`re-enable 
<enable-sync>` sync. This triggers a :ref:`client reset <client-resets>`, 
which can result in client-side data loss. As a result, we do not recommend
making breaking server-side schema changes.

Instead, you can let the existing collection remain in place with the 
existing schema, and create a partner collection with the new schema.

the original collection, but has the new schema definition in place. Partner
collections use database triggers to ensure that data flows in both directions,
meaning that when one collection is written to, the other is also written to 
(with the data modifications required for the new schema).

implement a schema change using the partner collection strategy, you must
perform a migration when you open the realm. For more information, see your 
preferred SDK's migration page.

If you choose to terminate and re-enable sync instead of using the partner
collection strategy to resolve this type of breaking change, you must 
manually update the schema. :ref:`Development Mode <enable-development-mode>` 
does not automatically update your schema for breaking changes.

Change a Class Name
-------------------

If you change a class name, this is a breaking or destructive change to 
both the server-side schema and the client-side object model.

A breaking server-side schema change requires you to :ref:`terminate sync 
<terminating-realm-sync>` in the backend, and then :ref:`re-enable 
<enable-sync>` sync. This triggers a :ref:`client reset <client-resets>`, 
which can result in client-side data loss. As a result, we do not recommend

does not automatically update your schema for breaking changes.

Summary
-------

- Non-breaking schema changes on synced {+realms+} are backward compatible, allowing old clients to sync with newer ones.
- Non-breaking changes to the schema of a synced {+realm+} do not require any additional configuration. However, you may need to migrate client realm files even when making non-breaking changes.
- Breaking changes are modifications to existing properties of a schema.
- To perform breaking schema changes to a synced {+realm+}, create a partner collection with the necessary schema changes and manually copy the data from the first collection to the second collection.
- To keep partner collections up-to-date with each other, set up database triggers to copy changed data from one collection to its partner.
- You can implement a breaking change by terminating and re-enabling sync and performing a client reset, but it is not recommended.

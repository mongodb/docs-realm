Overview
--------
If you need to make changes to an object schema that is used in {+sync+}, you 
can make :ref:`additive changes <additive-changes-synced-schema>` without any 
additional work. :ref:`Destructive changes <destructive-changes-synced-schema>`, 
however, require additional steps. A destructive change includes renaming an 
exiting field or changing a field's data type.

For more information, see :ref:`<synced-schema-overview>`.

If you need to make a destructive schema change, you have two choices: 

- :ref:`Terminate sync <terminating-realm-sync>` in the backend and then 
  :ref:`re-enable <enable-sync>` it from the start.

- Create a :ref:`partner collection <partner_collections>`, copy the old 
  data to this new collection, and set up triggers to ensure data 
  consistency. 
  
  The remainder of this guide leads you through creating a partner collection.

Partner Collections
-------------------
In the following procedure, the *initial* collection uses the JSON Schema below 
for a ``Task`` collection. Note that the schema for the ``Task`` contains an 
``_id`` field of type ``objectId``:

.. code-block:: json
    :caption: Task Schema
    :emphasize-lines: 9-10

    {
        "title": "Task",
        "bsonType": "object",
        "required": [
            "_id",
            "name"
        ],
        "properties": {
            "_id": {
                "bsonType": "objectId"
            },
            "_partition": {
                "bsonType": "string"
            },
            "name": {
                "bsonType": "string"
            }
        }
    }

The *new* schema is the same, except we want the ``_id`` field to be a string:

.. code-block:: json
    :caption: Task Schema
    :emphasize-lines: 9-10

    {
        "title": "Task",
        "bsonType": "object",
        "required": [
            "_id",
            "name"
        ],
        "properties": {
            "_id": {
                "bsonType": "string"
            },
            "_partition": {
                "bsonType": "string"
            },
            "name": {
                "bsonType": "string"
            }
        }
    }

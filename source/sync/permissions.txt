Overview
--------

Sync permissions determine a given user's read and write access to a specific
partition. When a user opens a synced {+realm+} instance, {+service-short+} dynamically
determines the user's permissions for the underlying partition based on
:ref:`Sync rules <sync-rules>` that you define.

You can structure your read and write permission expressions as a set of
permission strategies that apply to the different :ref:`partition strategies
<partition-strategies>` in your data model.

The following strategies outline common approaches that you might take to define
sync read and write permissions for your app.

Global Permissions
------------------

You can define global permissions that apply to all users for all
partitions. To define a global read or write permission, specify a boolean value
or a :ref:`JSON expression <expressions>` that always evaluates to the same
boolean value.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 50 50

   * - Example
     - Description

   * - .. code-block:: json
          
          true
     
     - The expression ``true`` means that all users have the given access
       permissions for all partitions.

   * - .. code-block:: json
          
          false
     
     - The expression ``false`` means that no users have the given access
       permissions for any partitions.

   * - .. code-block:: json
          
          { "%%true": true }
     
     - This expression always evaluates to ``true``, so it's effectively the
       same as directly specifying ``true``.

Permissions for Specific Partitions
-----------------------------------

You can define permissions that apply to a specific partition or a groups of
partitions by explicitly specifying their partition values.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 50 50

   * - Example
     - Description

   * - .. code-block:: json
     
          { "%%partition": "PUBLIC" }
     
     - This expression means that all users have the given access permissions
       for data with a partition value of ``"Public"``.

   * - .. code-block:: json
     
          {
            "%%partition": [
              "PUBLIC (NA)",
              "PUBLIC (EMEA)",
              "PUBLIC (APAC)"
            ]
          }
     
     - This expression means that all users have the given access permissions
       for data with any of the specified partition values.

Permissions for Specific Users
------------------------------

You can define permissions that apply to a specific user or a group of users by
explicitly specifying their ID values.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 50 50

   * - Example
     - Description

   * - .. code-block:: json
          
          { "%%user.id": "5f4863e4d49bd2191ff1e623" }
     
     - This expression means that the user with id
       ``"5f4863e4d49bd2191ff1e623"`` has the given access permissions for data
       in any partition.

   * - .. code-block:: json
          
          { 
            "%%user.id": [
               "5f4863e4d49bd2191ff1e623",
               "5f48640dd49bd2191ff1e624",
               "5f486417d49bd2191ff1e625"
            ]
          }
     
     - This expression means that any user with one of the specified user ID
       values has the given access permissions for data in any partition.

Permissions Based on User Data
------------------------------

You can define permissions that apply to users based on specific data defined in
their :ref:`custom user data <custom-user-data>` document, metadata fields, or
other data from an authentication provider.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 50 50

   * - Example
     - Description

   * - .. code-block:: json
     
          { "%%user.custom_data.readPartitions" : "%%partition" }
     
     - This expression means that a user has read access to a
       partition if the partition value is listed in the ``readPartitions``
       field of their custom user data.

   * - .. code-block:: json
     
          { "%%user.data.writePartitions" : "%%partition" }
     
     - This expression means that a user has write access to a
       partition if the partition value is listed in the
       ``data.writePartitions`` field of their user object.

Function Rules
--------------

You can define complex dynamic permissions by evaluating a :ref:`function
<functions>` that returns a boolean value. This is useful for permission schemes
that require you to access external systems or other custom logic that you
cannot express solely in JSON expressions.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 50 50

   * - Example
     - Description
   
   * - .. code-block:: json
          
          {
            "%%true": {
              "%function": {
                "name": "canReadPartition",
                "arguments": ["%%partition"]
              }
            }
          }
       
       .. code-block:: javascript
          
          // canReadPartition
          exports = async (partition) => {
            const cluster = context.services.get("mongodb-atlas");
            const permissions = cluster
              .db("myApp")
              .collection("permissions");
            const { canRead } = await permissions.findOne({ partition });
            return canRead.includes(context.user.id);
          }
     
     - This expression calls the ``canReadPartition`` function and
       passes in the partition value as its first and only argument. The
       function looks up the user's permissions for the partition from a MongoDB
       collection and then returns a boolean that indicates if the user can read
       data in the requested partition.

Overview
--------

A **partition** represents a subset of the documents in a synced cluster that
are related in some way and have the same read/write permissions for a given
user. Realm directly maps partitions to individual synced ``.realm`` files so
each object in a synced realm has a corresponding document in the partition.

Partitions bridge the gap between the Realm data model and the MongoDB document
model, which operate under different constraints and assumptions:

- A MongoDB cluster is composed of multiple remote servers with access to enough
  storage capacity to store all of your synced data. Each object type maps to
  its own collection.

- A synced realm is a specific local file and often has significant storage and
  memory constraints imposed by the device. Realms generally contain multiple
  object types but only a subset of all objects that are relevant to the end
  user.

   each shape's ``color``: red, green, or blue.

.. _partition-key:

Partition Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **partition key** is the name of the field that Realm uses to determine
which partition a given document in a synced MongoDB cluster belongs to. Your
app's partition key is a central part of the sync data model that you should
consider during development. Once you have chosen a partition key and
:ref:`enabled sync <enable-sync>`, you cannot reassign the partition key to a
different field. If you need to change a partition key, you can terminate sync
and then enable it with the new partition key; however, this requires all client
applications to reset and sync data into new realms.

Depending on your data model and the complexity of your app, your partition key
could be either:

- A property that already exists in each document and that logically partitions
  data. For example, if every document is private to a specific user you might
  indicate the user's ID value in an ``owner_id`` field and then use that as the
  partition key.

- A synthetic property that you create specifically to partition data (e.g.
  ``_partition``). This is useful for more complex data models that don't
  include a natural partition key or that require granular access permissions.

You can require that every synced object includes the partition key or allow
objects to optionally omit it. If you specify that the partition key is
optional, Realm maps any object that does not include it to a single default
partition called the *null partition*.

Consider the following when choosing a partition key:

- Partition keys must have one of the following property types: ``String``,
  ``ObjectID``, ``Long`` (``Int64``), or ``UUID``.

- {+service-short+} clients should never modify the partition value directly.
  Any field that clients can modify cannot be used as a partition key.

- Partition keys use the same field name in every synced document. The partition
  key should not collide with any field name in any object's model.

.. example::
   
   The following schemas demonstrate natural and synthetic partition keys:
   
   - The ``owner_id`` field is a natural key because it's already part of the
     app's data model.
   
   - The ``_partition`` field is a synthetic key because its only purpose is to
     serve as a partition key.
   
   An app can only specify a single partition key, but either of these fields
   could work depending on your use case:

      :emphasize-lines: 12, 13, 29, 30
      
      {
        "title": "note",
        "bsonType": "object",
        "required": [
          "_id",
          "_partition",
          "owner_id",
          "text"
        ],
        "properties": {
          "_id": { "bsonType": "objectId" },
          "_partition": { "bsonType": "string" },
          "owner_id": { "bsonType": "string" },
          "text": { "bsonType": "string" }
        }
      }
      
      {
        "title": "notebook",
        "bsonType": "object",
        "required": [
          "_id",
          "_partition",
          "owner_id",
          "notes"
        ],
        "properties": {
          "_id": { "bsonType": "objectId" },
          "_partition": { "bsonType": "string" },
          "owner_id": { "bsonType": "string" },
          "notes": {
            "bsonType": "array",
            "items": { "bsonType": "objectId" }
          }
        }
      }

.. _partition-value:

Partition Value
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **partition value** is a value of the partition key field for a given
document. Documents with the same partition value belong to the same partition,
sync to the same realm file, and share user-level data access permissions.

A partition's value is the identifier for its corresponding synced realm. To
work with the data in a given partition from a client application, you specify
the partition's value when you open its corresponding synced realm. If you
change a partition value in {+atlas-short+}, Realm interprets the change as a
delete from the old partition and an insert into the new partition.

.. warning::

   If you modify a document's partition value, you will lose any local changes
   to the data that have not yet been synced.

.. _partition-strategy:

Partition Strategy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **partition strategy** is a specific partition key and value pattern that you
use to divide objects into partitions for a particular use case. Combined with
sync permissions, partition strategies form a core part of your app's synced
data model that determines the data that each user can access and store on their
device.

You can compose individual partition strategies within the same app to form a
larger strategy that handles arbitrarily complex use cases. The exact strategy
that you should use depends on your app's data model and access patterns. For
example, you might make some data, like announcements or an organizational
chart, available in a public partition but restrict other data, like personal
information, to privileged users.

.. example::
   
   Check out the :ref:`Partition Strategies <partition-strategies>` page to see
   some common partitioning use cases, including examples of how to implement
   each strategy and how to combine multiple strategies.

Overview
--------

A **partition** represents a subset of the documents in a synced cluster that
are related in some way and have the same read/write permissions for a given
user. Realm directly maps partitions to individual synced ``.realm`` files so
each object in a synced realm has a corresponding document in the partition.

Partitions bridge the gap between the Realm data model and the MongoDB document
model, which operate under different constraints and assumptions:

- A MongoDB cluster is composed of multiple remote servers with access to enough
  storage capacity to store all of your synced data. Each object type maps to
  its own collection.

- A synced realm is a specific local file and often has significant storage and
  memory constraints imposed by the device. Realms generally contain multiple
  object types but only a subset of all objects that are relevant to the end
  user.

   each shape's ``color``: red, green, or blue.

.. _partition-key:

Partition Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **partition key** is the name of the field that Realm uses to determine
which partition a given document in a synced MongoDB cluster belongs to. Your
app's partition key is a central part of the sync data model that you should
consider during development. Once you have chosen a partition key and
:ref:`enabled sync <enable-sync>`, you cannot reassign the partition key to a
different field. If you need to change a partition key, you can terminate sync
and then enable it with the new partition key; however, this requires all client
applications to reset and sync data into new realms.

Depending on your data model and the complexity of your app, your partition key
could be either:

- A property that already exists in each document and that logically partitions
  data. For example, if every document is private to a specific user you might
  indicate the user's ID value in an ``owner_id`` field and then use that as the
  partition key.

- A synthetic property that you create specifically to partition data (e.g.
  ``_partition``). This is useful for more complex data models that don't
  include a natural partition key or that require granular access permissions.

You can require that every synced object includes the partition key or allow
objects to optionally omit it. If you specify that the partition key is
optional, Realm maps any object that does not include it to a single default
partition called the *null partition*.

Consider the following when choosing a partition key:

- Partition keys must have one of the following property types: ``String``,
  ``ObjectID``, ``Long``, or ``UUID``.

- {+service-short+} clients should never modify the partition value directly.
  Any field that clients can modify cannot be used as a partition key.

- Partition keys use the same field name in every synced document. The partition
  key should not collide with any field name in any object's model.

.. example::
   
   The following schemas demonstrate natural and synthetic partition keys:
   
   - The ``owner_id`` field is a natural key because it's already part of the
     app's data model.
   
   - The ``_partition`` field is a synthetic key because its only purpose is to
     serve as a partition key.
   
   An app can only specify a single partition key, but either of these fields
   could work depending on your use case:

   .. code-block:: json
      :emphasize-lines: 12, 13, 29, 30
      
      {
        "title": "note",
        "bsonType": "object",
        "required": [
          "_id",
          "_partition",
          "owner_id",
          "text"
        ],
        "properties": {
          "_id": { "bsonType": "objectId" },
          "_partition": { "bsonType": "string" },
          "owner_id": { "bsonType": "string" },
          "text": { "bsonType": "string" }
        }
      }
      
      {
        "title": "notebook",
        "bsonType": "object",
        "required": [
          "_id",
          "_partition",
          "owner_id",
          "notes"
        ],
        "properties": {
          "_id": { "bsonType": "objectId" },
          "_partition": { "bsonType": "string" },
          "owner_id": { "bsonType": "string" },
          "notes": {
            "bsonType": "array",
            "items": { "bsonType": "objectId" }
          }
        }
      }

.. _partition-value:

Partition Value
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **partition value** is a value of the partition key field for a given
document. Documents with the same partition value belong to the same partition,
sync to the same realm file, and share user-level data access permissions.

A partition's value is the identifier for its corresponding synced realm. To
work with the data in a given partition from a client application, you specify
the partition's value when you open its corresponding synced realm. If you
change a partition value in {+atlas-short+}, Realm interprets the change as a
delete from the old partition and an insert into the new partition.

.. warning::

   If you modify a document's partition value, you will lose any local changes
   to the data that have not yet been synced.

.. _partition-strategy:
.. _partition-strategies:

Partition Strategy
------------------

A **partition strategy** is a specific partition key and value pattern that you
use to divide objects into partitions for a particular use case. Realm uses 
:ref:`partitions <sync-partitions>` to map objects between synced realms on 
client devices and documents stored in MongoDB Atlas. Partitions are a
core part of your synced data model that determine each user's read and write
access to objects in the partition.

You can compose individual partition strategies within the same app to form a
larger strategy that handles arbitrarily complex use cases. The exact strategy
that you should use depends on your app's data model and access patterns. For
example, you might make some data, like announcements or an organizational
chart, available in a public partition but restrict other data, like personal
information, to privileged users.

When developing a partition strategy, there are two primary areas to consider:

- **Data Security:** Your users likely need individualized read and write access to
  data depending on some conditions. A partition strategy should consider which
  users need to access which partitions to make sure that a given user always
  has the same data access permissions for every document in a partition.

- **Storage Capacity:** Your client applications may have limited on-device storage
  space available to them depending on the device and platform. A partition
  strategy should take storage limitations into account to make sure a user's
  synced data can be stored on their device.

.. tip:: Combine Strategies
   
   To use multiple strategies in the same app, you can use a generic partition
   key field name like ``_partition`` with a partition value structured like a
   query string. For example:
   
   .. code-block:: javascript
   
      _partitionKey: "user_id=abcdefg"
      _partitionKey: "team_id=1234&city='New York, NY'"
   
   You can use functions and rule expressions to parse the string and determine
   whether or not a given user has access to a {+realm+} based on the combined
   strategy.

.. _partition-strategy-firehose:

Firehose Strategy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A firehose partition strategy groups all documents into a single partition so
that every user syncs all of your app's data to their device. This approach is
functionally a decision not to partition data and is suitable only for basic
applications or relatively small public data sets.

- **Data Security:** All data in the firehose partition is public to clients 
  with an open {+realm+} that uses the partition. 
  If a given user has read or write access to the partition, 
  they can read or write *any* document.

- **Storage Capacity:** Every user syncs every document in the firehose
  partition, so all data must fit within your most restrictive storage
  limitation. You should only use this strategy for data sets that are
  relatively small and that do not grow quickly.


The most straightforward way to configure a firehose is to set the partition
key as an optional field not present in any document. Realm maps any document
that doesn't include a partition value to the **null partition**.

You can also set a **static partition value**, where the partition value is 
a property that doesn't change based on the user or data. 
For example, you could configure {+realm+}s across all clients to use the 
partition value ``"MyPartitionValue"``.

.. example::
   
   A local sports app lets users download and browse game scores and statistics
   for historical high school baseball games. Consider the following documents
   in the ``games`` and ``teams`` collections:
   
   .. code-block:: javascript
      
      collection games: [
        { teams: ["Brook Ridge Miners", "Southside Rockets"], score: { ... }, date: ... }
        { teams: ["Brook Ridge Miners", "Uptown Bombers"], score: { ... }, date: ... }
        { teams: ["Brook Ridge Miners", "Southside Rockets"], score: { ... }, date: ... }
        { teams: ["Southside Rockets", "Uptown Bombers"], score: { ... }, date: ... }
        { teams: ["Brook Ridge Miners", "Uptown Bombers"], score: { ... }, date: ... }
        { teams: ["Southside Rockets", "Uptown Bombers"], score: { ... }, date: ... }
      ]
      
      collection teams: [
        { name: "Brook Ridge Miners" }
        { name: "Southside Rockets" }
        { name: "Uptown Bombers" }
      ]
   
   The total number of historical games is relatively small, and a small number
   of local teams only play a few games each year, so most devices should be
   able to download all of the game data for easy offline access. In this case,
   the firehose strategy is appropriate, and the documents don't need to have a
   partition key.
   
   The strategy maps the collections to the following realms:
   
   .. code-block:: javascript
      
      realm null: [
        Game { teams: ["Brook Ridge Miners", "Southside Rockets"], score: { ... }, date: ... }
        Game { teams: ["Brook Ridge Miners", "Uptown Bombers"], score: { ... }, date: ... }
        Game { teams: ["Brook Ridge Miners", "Southside Rockets"], score: { ... }, date: ... }
        Game { teams: ["Southside Rockets", "Uptown Bombers"], score: { ... }, date: ... }
        Game { teams: ["Brook Ridge Miners", "Uptown Bombers"], score: { ... }, date: ... }
        Game { teams: ["Southside Rockets", "Uptown Bombers"], score: { ... }, date: ... }
        Team { name: "Brook Ridge Miners" }
        Team { name: "Southside Rockets" }
        Team { name: "Uptown Bombers" }
      ]

.. _partition-strategy-user:

User Strategy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A user partition strategy groups private documents that belong to a user into a
partition specific to that user. This approach is effective when each document
has a specific owner, often identified by a username or ID, and no other users
need access to the data.

- **Data Security:** Data in a user partition is specific to a given user and
  may contain information private to that user. In general, each user syncs only
  their own partition and other users cannot access documents in the partition.

- **Storage Capacity:** In general, each user only syncs data from their own
  partition, so their data must fit within their device's storage constraints.
  You can use this strategy when data has specific owners that each own a
  manageable amount of data.

.. example::
   
   A music streaming app stores data about playlists and song ratings for each
   user. Consider the following documents in the ``playlists`` and ``ratings``
   collections:
   
   .. code-block:: javascript
      
      collection playlists: [
        { name: "Work", owner_id: "dog_enthusiast_95", song_ids: [ ... ] }
        { name: "Party", owner_id: "cat_enthusiast_92", song_ids: [ ... ] }
        { name: "Soup Tunes", owner_id: "dog_enthusiast_95", song_ids: [ ... ] }
        { name: "Disco Anthems", owner_id: "PUBLIC", song_ids: [ ... ] }
        { name: "Deep Focus", owner_id: "PUBLIC", song_ids: [ ... ] }
      ]
      
      collection ratings: [
        { owner_id: "dog_enthusiast_95", song_id: 3, rating: -1 }
        { owner_id: "cat_enthusiast_92", song_id: 1, rating: 1 }
        { owner_id: "dog_enthusiast_95", song_id: 1, rating: 1 }
      ]
   
   Every document includes the ``owner_id`` field, which is a good partition key
   for a user partition strategy because it naturally maps documents to individual
   users. This limits the data on each device to only include playlists and ratings
   that are relevant for the device's user.
   
   - Users have read and write access to their user realm, which contains playlists
     they have created and ratings that they've given to songs.
     
   - Every user has read access to the {+realm+} for partition value ``PUBLIC``,
     which contains playlists that are available to all users.
   
   The strategy maps the collections to the following realms:
   
   .. code-block:: javascript
      
      realm dog_enthusiast_95: [
        Playlist { name: "Work", owner_id: "dog_enthusiast_95", song_ids: [ ... ] }
        Playlist { name: "Soup Tunes", owner_id: "dog_enthusiast_95", song_ids: [ ... ] }
        Rating { owner_id: "dog_enthusiast_95", song_id: 3, rating: -1 }
        Rating { owner_id: "dog_enthusiast_95", song_id: 1, rating: 1 }
      ]
      
      realm cat_enthusiast_92: [
        Playlist { name: "Party", owner_id: "cat_enthusiast_92", song_ids: [ ... ] }
        Rating { owner_id: "cat_enthusiast_92", song_id: 1, rating: 1 }
      ]
      
      realm PUBLIC: [
        Playlist { name: "Disco Anthems", owner_id: "PUBLIC", song_ids: [ ... ] }
        Playlist { name: "Deep Focus", owner_id: "PUBLIC", song_ids: [ ... ] }
      ]

.. _partition-strategy-team:

Team Strategy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A team partition strategy groups private documents shared by a team of users
(e.g. a store location's employee, a band's members, etc) into a partition
specific to that group. All users in the team share access and ownership of the
team's documents.

- **Data Security:** Data in a team partition is specific to a given team and
  may contain information private to that team but not necessarily private to
  any specific member of the team. In general each user syncs partitions for the
  teams they belong to and users not in a given team cannot access documents in
  the team's partition.

- **Storage Capacity:** In general, each user only syncs data from their own
  teams. The combined data from any given user's teams must fit within their
  device's storage constraints. You can use this strategy when data belongs to
  specific teams and each user belongs to a manageable number of teams. If a
  user may belong to many teams, you may need to limit the number of team
  partitions that they sync at any time.

.. example::
   
   A productivity app lets users create projects where they can collaborate on
   tasks with other users. Consider the following documents in the ``projects``
   and ``tasks`` collections:
   
   .. code-block:: javascript
      
      collection projects: [
        { name: "CLI", owner_id: "cli-team", task_ids: [ ... ] }
        { name: "API", owner_id: "api-team", task_ids: [ ... ] }
      ]
      
      collection tasks: [
        { status: "complete", owner_id: "api-team", text: "Import dependencies" }
        { status: "inProgress", owner_id: "api-team", text: "Create app MVP" }
        { status: "inProgress", owner_id: "api-team", text: "Investigate off-by-one issue" }
        { status: "todo", owner_id: "api-team", text: "Write tests" }
        { status: "inProgress", owner_id: "cli-team", text: "Create command specifications" }
        { status: "todo", owner_id: "cli-team", text: "Choose a CLI framework" }
      ]
   
   Every document includes the ``owner_id`` field, which is a good partition key
   for a team partition strategy because it naturally maps documents to individual
   teams. This limits the data on each device to only include projects and tasks
   that are relevant for the device's user.
   
   - Users have read and write access to partitions owned by a team that they're
     a member of.
     
   - Team membership could be determined by data stored in a ``teams`` or
     ``users`` collection:
     
     .. code-block:: javascript
        
        collection teams: [
          { name: "cli-team", member_ids: [ ... ] }
          { name: "api-team", member_ids: [ ... ] }
        ]
        
        collection users: [
          { name: "Joe", team_ids: [ ... ] }
          { name: "Liz", team_ids: [ ... ] }
          { name: "Matt", team_ids: [ ... ] }
          { name: "Emmy", team_ids: [ ... ] }
          { name: "Scott", team_ids: [ ... ] }
        ]
   
   The strategy maps the collections to the following realms:
   
   .. code-block:: javascript
      
      realm cli-team: [
        Project { name: "CLI", owner_id: "cli-team", task_ids: [ ... ] }
        Task { status: "inProgress", owner_id: "cli-team", text: "Create command specifications" }
        Task { status: "todo", owner_id: "cli-team", text: "Choose a CLI framework" }
      ]
        
      realm api-team: [
        Project { name: "API", owner_id: "api-team", task_ids: [ ... ] }
        Task { status: "complete", owner_id: "api-team", text: "Import dependencies" }
        Task { status: "inProgress", owner_id: "api-team", text: "Create app MVP" }
        Task { status: "inProgress", owner_id: "api-team", text: "Investigate off-by-one issue" }
        Task { status: "todo", owner_id: "api-team", text: "Write tests" }
      ]

.. _partition-strategy-channel:

Channel Strategy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A channel partition strategy groups documents relevant to a common topic or
domain into a partition specific to that area. Users can choose to access or
subscribe to specific channels, often identified by a name or ID, from a public
list.

- **Data Security:** Data in a channel partition is specific to a given topic or
  area that a user can choose to access. You can limit a user's access to
  specific channels or prevent them from accessing channels entirely, but if a
  user has read or write permission for a channel then they can access any
  document in the partition.

- **Storage Capacity:** Users can choose to sync data from any allowed channel.
  The combined data from all of the channels a given user accesses must fit
  within their device's storage constraints. You can use this strategy to
  partition public or semi-private data sets that would otherwise not fit within
  storage constraints.

.. example::
   
   A social app lets users create chatrooms based on specific topics. Users
   can search for and join channels for any topic that interests them. Consider
   the following documents in the ``chatrooms`` and ``messages`` collections:
   
   .. code-block:: javascript
      
      collection chatrooms: [
        { topic: "cats", description: "A place to talk about cats" }
        { topic: "sports", description: "We like sports and we don't care who knows" }
      ]
      
      collection messages: [
        { topic: "cats", text: "Check out this cute pic of my cat!", timestamp: 1625772933383 }
        { topic: "cats", text: "Can anybody recommend a good cat food brand?", timestamp: 1625772953383 }
        { topic: "sports", text: "Did you catch the game last night?", timestamp: 1625772965383 }
        { topic: "sports", text: "Yeah what a comeback! Incredible!", timestamp: 1625772970383 }
        { topic: "sports", text: "I can't believe how they scored that goal.", timestamp: 1625773000383 }
      ]
   
   Every document includes the ``topic`` field, which is a good partition key for
   a channel partition strategy because it naturally maps documents to individual
   channels. This limits the data on each device to only include messages and
   metadata for chatrooms that the user has subscribed to.
   
   - Users could have read and write access to chatrooms that they're subscribed
     to, which would allow them to modify or delete any message, even those sent
     by other users. To limit write permissions, you could give users read-only
     access and handle sending messages with a serverless function.
   
   - You could determine which channels a user has subscribed to by storing the
     subscription in either the ``chatrooms`` or ``users`` collection:
     
     .. code-block:: javascript
        
        collection chatrooms: [
          { topic: "cats", subscriber_ids: [ ... ] }
          { topic: "sports", subscriber_ids: [ ... ] }
        ]
        
        collection users: [
          { name: "Joe", chatroom_ids: [ ... ] }
          { name: "Liz", chatroom_ids: [ ... ] }
          { name: "Matt", chatroom_ids: [ ... ] }
          { name: "Emmy", chatroom_ids: [ ... ] }
          { name: "Scott", chatroom_ids: [ ... ] }
        ]
   
   The strategy maps the collections to the following realms:
   
   .. code-block:: javascript
      
      realm cats: [
        Chatroom { topic: "cats", description: "A place to talk about cats" }
        Message { topic: "cats", text: "Check out this cute pic of my cat!", timestamp: 1625772933383 }
        Message { topic: "cats", text: "Can anybody recommend a good cat food brand?", timestamp: 1625772953383 }
      ]
      
      realm sports: [
        Chatroom { topic: "sports", description: "We like sports and we don't care who knows" }
        Message { topic: "sports", text: "Did you catch the game last night?", timestamp: 1625772965383 }
        Message { topic: "sports", text: "Yeah what a comeback! Incredible!", timestamp: 1625772970383 }
        Message { topic: "sports", text: "I can't believe how they scored that goal.", timestamp: 1625773000383 }
      ]

.. _partition-strategy-region:

Region Strategy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A region partition strategy groups documents that are relevant to a specific
location or region into partitions specific to those areas.

- **Data Security:** Data in a region partition is specific to a given
  geographic area. You can limit a user's access to just the region they're
  currently in or give access to data on a region-by-region basis.

- **Storage Capacity:** The storage implications of a region strategy depend on
  the size and usage patterns for each region. Users typically only sync data in
  their own region, so at a minimum the data for any given region should fit
  within a device's storage constraints. If users sync multiple regions, you may
  consider partitioning into smaller subregions to minimize syncing unneeded
  data.

.. example::
   
   A food delivery app lets users search for nearby restaurants and order from
   their menus. Consider the following documents in the ``restaurants``
   collection:
   
   .. code-block:: javascript
      
      collection restaurants: [
        { city: "New York, NY", name: "Joe's Pizza", menu: [ ... ] }
        { city: "New York, NY", name: "Han Dynasty", menu: [ ... ] }
        { city: "New York, NY", name: "Harlem Taste", menu: [ ... ] }
        { city: "Chicago, IL", name: "Lou Malnati's", menu: [ ... ] }
        { city: "Chicago, IL", name: "Al's Beef", menu: [ ... ] }
        { city: "Chicago, IL", name: "Nando's", menu: [ ... ] }
      ]
   
   Every document includes the ``city`` field, which is a good partition key for
   a region partition strategy because it naturally maps documents to specific
   physical areas. This limits the data on each device to only include messages
   and metadata for the user's current city. Users have read access to
   restaurants in their current region, which you could determine in your
   application logic.
   
   The strategy maps the collections to the following realms:
   
   .. code-block:: javascript
      
      realm New York, NY: [
       { city: "New York, NY", name: "Joe's Pizza", menu: [ ... ] }
       { city: "New York, NY", name: "Han Dynasty", menu: [ ... ] }

Bucket Strategy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A bucket partition strategy groups documents that range along a particular
dimension into partitions that each contain documents from a discrete subrange.
In time-based bucket strategies, you can use scheduled triggers to move
documents to a new partition when they fall out of their bucket range.

- **Data Security:** You can use permissions to limit users to
  read or write only specific buckets. Data may flow between buckets, so
  consider the access permissions for a document across all possible buckets,
  not just its current bucket.

- **Storage Capacity:** The storage implications of a bucket strategy depend on
  the size and usage patterns for each bucket. Consider which buckets users need
  to access and limit the size of buckets to fit within a device's storage
  constraints. If users sync many buckets, especially for disjoint data,
  consider partitioning into smaller buckets to minimize syncing unneeded data.

.. example::
   
   An IoT app shows real-time views of sensor readings that come in several
   times a second. It groups readings into time buckets based on the number of
   seconds since the reading was taken. Consider the following documents in the
   ``readings`` collection:
   
   .. code-block:: javascript
      
      collection readings: [
        { bucket: "0s<t<=60s", timestamp: 1625773000383 , data: { ... } }
        { bucket: "0s<t<=60s", timestamp: 1625772970383 , data: { ... } }
        { bucket: "0s<t<=60s", timestamp: 1625772965383 , data: { ... } }
        { bucket: "60s<t<=300s", timestamp: 1625772953383 , data: { ... } }
        { bucket: "60s<t<=300s", timestamp: 1625772933383 , data: { ... } }
      ]
   
   Every document includes the ``bucket`` field, which maps documents to
   specific time ranges. This limits the data on each device to only include
   sensor readings for the time period a user is viewing.
   
   - Users have read access to sensor readings for any time bucket they view
   
   - The sensors use their own client apps with write access to upload readings
   
   The strategy maps the collections to the following realms:
   
   .. code-block:: javascript
      
      realm 0s<t<=60s: [
        Reading { bucket: "0s<t<=60s", timestamp: 1625773000383 , data: { ... } }
        Reading { bucket: "0s<t<=60s", timestamp: 1625772970383 , data: { ... } }
        Reading { bucket: "0s<t<=60s", timestamp: 1625772965383 , data: { ... } }
      ]
      
      realm 60s<t<=300s: [
        Reading { bucket: "60s<t<=300s", timestamp: 1625772953383 , data: { ... } }
        Reading { bucket: "60s<t<=300s", timestamp: 1625772933383 , data: { ... } }
      ]

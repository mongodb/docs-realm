Overview
--------

When you enable {+sync+}, you must specify a {+sync-short+} mode for your 
{+app+}. The {+sync-short+} mode determines how users can access data 
from the {+service+} SDK in the client app. {+service-short+} offers two 
{+sync-short+} modes:

- Partition-Based Sync
- Flexible Sync (preview)

You can't mix Partition-Based Sync and Flexible Sync within the same 
{+app+}, so you must decide which {+sync+} mode to use in a given 
application.

Partition-Based Sync
--------------------

:ref:`Partition-Based Sync <partition-based-sync>` works best for 
applications where a subset of the documents in a synced cluster are 
related and have the same read/write permissions for a given user. 
Those documents form a **partition**.

In Partition-Based Sync, you define a :ref:`partition key <partition-key>` 
whose value determines whether the user can read or write a document. 
{+service+} :ref:`evaluates a set of rules <partition-based-rules-and-permissions>` 
to determine whether users can read or write to a given partition. Realm 
directly maps a partition to individual synced ``.realm`` files. Each 
object in a synced realm has a corresponding document in the partition.

Choose Partition-Based Sync when:

- You can define a single field and use an equality query to determine which
  documents to sync
- Your data structure supports permissions at a partition level
- You want to release a production app quickly, while Flexible Sync
  is still in preview

.. example::

   Partition-Based Sync might be a good fit for an inventory management 
   application. If you use ``store_number`` as the partition key, each 
   store can read and write documents pertaining to its inventory.
   
   An example of the permissions for this type of app might be:

   .. code-block:: json
     
      { "%%partition": "Store 42" }

   Store employees could have read and write access to documents whose store 
   number is Store 42.

   Customers, meanwhile, could have read-only access to store inventory.

Flexible Sync
-------------

.. include:: /includes/note-flexible-sync-preview.rst

:ref:`Flexible Sync <flexible-sync>` works best for applications that need 
to define a query in the client application, and Sync only the documents 
that match the query. {+service-short+} translates those documents to 
objects in the client application, making it easy to work with objects 
in your app. Additionally, it allows permissions to be applied on a 
per-document basis.

In Flexible Sync, you define a set of :ref:`queryable fields 
<queryable-fields>` that you can query from the client application. 
You can then subscribe to queries on those fields from the client 
application. When a client starts a Sync session, {+service-short+} 
evaluates :ref:`rules <flexible-sync-rules-and-permissions>` to determine 
which documents in the query the user can access. Realm maps the documents 
that a user can access to a synced ``.realm`` file. Each object in a synced 
realm gets translated to a corresponding document in {+atlas+}.

Choose Flexible Sync when:

- You need to create expressive query and result sets using a broad range 
  of queries on up to 10 fields
- You want to apply permissions at the document level
- You need a flexible permissioning system to apply more granular permissions

.. example::

   Flexible Sync might be a good fit for software to manage a medical 
   provider's office. The combination of queryable fields and granular 
   permissions means you could write software where:

   - Physicians have read and write access to a patient's health history, 
     and can add notes for visits, new medications, and instructions. 
     However, a physician might not have access to billing data or a 
     patient's social security number.
   - Billing specialists have access to a specific subset of patient data, 
     such as dates and procedure codes, but don't have access to physician's 
     notes, prescription history, or other patient health data.
   - Patients have read access to their own history, such as physician 
     notes, medications, and instructions. They can also view billing 
     information, such as procedure dates, costs, and payment history.
     However, a patient would not have write access to any of this data.

   To achieve this level of permission granularity, you might have different 
   collections storing patient information: 
   
   - A ``Patient_History`` collection storing provider notes, medications, 
     and other patient health data
   - A ``Billing`` collection storing dates of procedures, billing codes, 
     insurance information, and other relevant data 

   The permissions for these two collections might look similar to:

   .. code-block:: json

         {
           "Patient_History": {
             "roles": [
               {
                 name: "provider", 
                 applyWhen: { "%%user.custom_data.isProvider": true},
                 read: {}, // evaluates to the same as %%true
                 write: {}
               },
               {
                 name: "self",
                 applyWhen: {},
                 read: {"patient_id": "%%user.id"},
                 write: false
               }
             ]
           },
           "Billing": {
             "roles": [
               {
                 name: "billingSpecialist", 
                 applyWhen: { "%%user.custom_data.isBillingSpecialist": true},
                 read: {}, // evaluates to the same as %%true
                 write: {}
               },
               {
                 name: "self",
                 applyWhen: {},
                 read: {"patient_id": "%%user.id"},
                 write: false
               }
             ]
           }
         }

   The queryable fields might be ``patient_id`` and ``procedure_date``. 
   This would enable the client application to query for specific patients, 
   while billing specialists could query for visits within a time window, 
   such as 30 days.

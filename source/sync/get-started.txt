Overview
--------

{+sync+} enables you to share data across devices, between :term:`{+service-short+}
clients <{+service-short+} client>` and a :term:`synced {+atlas+} cluster <synced
cluster>`.

.. _enable-sync:

Enable Sync
-----------

You can enable {+sync-short+} on any {+app+} you have :ref:`created <create-a-realm-app>`.

.. include:: /includes/mongodb-4.4-required-for-sync-admonition.rst

.. note::

   {+service-short+} syncs all data from collections with a defined
   :ref:`{+backend-schema+} <mongodb-schemas>` in your :term:`Atlas cluster <linked
   cluster>`. If you do not specify a field in your schema, Realm will not sync that
   field to the clients.

.. include:: /includes/steps/enable-sync-ui.rst

Best Practices
--------------

We recommend following these best practices to ensure optimal {+app+}
performance:

Deployment model and geographic regions:
  Use a local {+service-short+} :ref:`deployment model<realm-local-deployment>` 
  when building a {+sync+} application. Configure your {+app+} and
  MongoDB data source to run within the same geographic region and cloud
  provider.

Atlas oplog:
  {+sync+} requires access to the {+atlas+} oplog. For best results,
  keep 48 hours of oplog for a cluster using {+sync-short+}. 

.. seealso::

   :atlas:`Atlas oplog </reference/atlas-oplog>`

Summary
-------

- You can enable {+sync+} on your :term:`linked cluster` for any {+app+} you have created.

Overview
--------

{+service-short+} keeps a history of changes to underlying data, similar
to the :manual:`MongoDB oplog <core/replica-set-oplog/>`, to synchronize
data stored in client {+client-database+} instances. When a client does
not check in for a long period of time, the data stored on that client
can predate the beginning of the history of changes stored in the backend.
When that happens, the client must complete a :ref:`client reset
<client-resets>` to resume synchronizing data. The
**client maximum offline time** of your {+app+} controls how many days
of history your app maintains. As a result, any clients who have not
synchronized data in *more than client maximum offline time days* must
perform a client reset, and any local changes on that client will be
lost unless manually backed up and restored after the client reset.

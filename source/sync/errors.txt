Overview
--------

While you develop applications using {+sync+}, you may run into errors. This
section details some common errors. 


.. _sync-errors-error-codes:

Error Codes
-----------
When the server encounters an error that appears to be caused by the connected
client, it will send an error message to that client. The error message will
have a code number and description. To see the full list of sync errors, see the
:github:`error code list on the Realm Core github repository. <realm/realm-core/blob/master/doc/protocol/protocol_1.md#error-codes>`.

.. _sync-error-logging:

Error Logging
-------------
When actively troubleshooting an issue, set the logging level to ``debug`` or
``trace`` to diagnose errors while developing your application. When running in a
production environment, you will want to decrease the logging level for improved
performance.

.. _sync-errors-client-resets:

Client Resets
-------------

When using :doc:`{+sync+} </sync>`, a **client
reset** is a serious error recovery task that your client
app must perform in the following situation:

- The given synced {+realm+} on the server was restored from a backup.
  For example, due to a {+service-short+} server crash.

- The client app made changes to that {+realm+} since the backup was made,
  but did not sync those changes back to the server before the server
  was restored.

In other words, the client app must carry out a client reset
on a given synced {+realm+} if the server is restored to a
version older than the version on the client.

A client reset erases all local data and downloads a new copy of the
data stored in MongoDB Atlas. Performing a client reset loses all local
changes made since the client last successfully synced.

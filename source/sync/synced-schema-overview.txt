Overview
--------

When developing an application using {+sync+}, you may need to make changes to
your schema at some point: you have a new property to add to an already-synced 
object, you decide to change the type stored in a property, or you now need to 
make a property *required*, for example. 

The {+service-short+} APIs provide for 
backward-compatible schema changes to synced realms, allowing old clients to
sync with newer ones. Destructive schema changes, however, take some planning and 
work. 

The difficulty with implementing a destructive schema changes is that older 
clients (those that have not been updated to your new code and schema) still 
need access to the data via the old schema definition, while clients that are 
updated need to work with the new schema changes.

.. _additive-changes-synced-schema:

Additive Changes
----------------

Additive changes, such as adding a class or adding a field to an existing class, 
are applied automatically to synced {+realms+}; you can make these 
additive schema changes with no additional configuration changes. Increase
the schema version in your client applications to use the new schema
properties.

.. note:: Removing a Property from Your Schema Is Considered an Additive Change

   To maintain backward compatibility, removing a field from a schema doesn’t
   delete the field from the database and instead instructs Realm to ignore that
   field. New objects retain the removed field, but Realm automatically sets the
   field's value to ``null``. Realm sets fields that are non-nullable to an
   appropriate empty value, such as a 0 for integer values or an empty string
   for string values.

.. _destructive-changes-synced-schema:

Destructive Changes
-------------------

Destructive changes to a schema are usually **modifications** of existing fields, 
such as:

- Changing a property’s type but keeping the same name
- Changing a primary key
- Changing a property from optional to required (or vice-versa)

Synchronized {+realms+} only support additive changes to a schema. Therefore,
attempting to perform a destructive change on a synchronized {+realm+} leads 
to errors like the following:

.. code-block:: shell

   {
    message: 'The following changes cannot be made in additive-only schema mode:\n' +
      "- Property 'Task._id' has been changed from 'int' to 'string'.",
    errorCode: 1
   }

If you are developing an application using Realm Sync and need to make a destructive
schema change, you have two choices: :ref:`terminate sync <terminating-realm-sync>` 
in the backend and then :ref:`re-enable <enable-sync>` it from the start, or 
create a **"partner collection"**.

.. _partner_collections:

Partner Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A partner collection is a collection that contains the same data as
the original collection, but has the new schema definition in place. Partner
collections use database triggers to ensure that data flows in both directions,
meaning that when one collection is written to, the other is also written to 
(with the data modifications required for the new schema).

To implement a schema change, see :ref:`<migrate-schema-partner-collection>`.

Summary
-------

- Schema changes on synced {+realms+} are backward compatible, allowing old clients to sync with newer ones.
- Additive changes to the schema of a synced {+realm+} do not require any additional configuration. 
- Synchronized {+realms+} only support additive changes to a schema.
- Destructive changes are modifications to existing fields of a schema.
- Synchronized {+realms+} do not support destructive changes directly. 
- To perform destructive schema changes to a synced {+realm+}, create a partner collection with the necessary schema changes and manually copy the data from the first collection to the second collection.
- To keep partner collections up-to-date with each other, set up database triggers to copy changed data from one collection to its partner.

Overview
--------

Your :term:`Realm app's <Realm app>` :term:`linked MongoDB Atlas cluster
<linked cluster>` contains all of the data stored by your application:
your application data, client data, :ref:`custom user data
<custom-user-data>`, administrative data, and more.

Client applications only need the data relevant to the current user.
Most users only have permission to access a limited subset of the data
in a linked cluster. Some data, like user settings and personal
information, are only relevant to a single user.

:term:`Partitioning <partitioning>` helps you turn the large amount of
data stored by your application into the small amount of data needed by
individual clients, called :term:`Realms <Realm>`.

Partition Keys
--------------

MongoDB Realm uses :term:`partition keys <partition key>` to map
:term:`MongoDB documents <MongoDB document>` in a
:term:`synced MongoDB Atlas cluster <synced cluster>` into
:term:`Realm objects <Realm object>` in :term:`Realms <Realm>`. A
partition key is a special field used by MongoDB Realm to determine the
Realm membership for MongoDB documents. Your partition key should exist
in every document that your application needs to synchronize between
clients and Atlas. The partition key field name is universal across a
Realm app -- every synced document uses the same field name to
partition.

Choose a Partition Key
++++++++++++++++++++++

Your partition key depends entirely on your use case: some applications
only require a per-user permission scheme, but many require permissions
based on collections of users. Generally, a few guidelines exist to
choose partition keys:

- Realm clients should never modify the partition value directly. Any
  field that clients can modify cannot be used as a partition
  key.

- Changing a partition value is an expensive operation, requiring a
  deletion of the object from one Realm and an insertion of the same
  object into another Realm. As a result, you should choose a partition
  key that rarely, if ever, needs to change.

- Partition keys use the same field name in every synced document. Pick
  a field name that is unlikely to collide with an another field name
  in any Realm object's model. You can begin the field name with an
  underscore, (e.g. ``_partitionKey``) to decrease the likelihood of
  collisions and indicate the importance of the field in the Object Model
  itself.

- Partition keys must have a value of one of the
  :ref:`supported types for partition keys
  <partition-limitations-types>`.

For more information about how to choose
a partition key for your application, see :ref:`Partition Strategies
<partition-strategies>`.

Define a Partition Key
++++++++++++++++++++++

You can define a partition key when enabling :term:`Realm sync` for your
Realm app. After selecting a cluster to sync, choose your partition key.
You can either use an existing field or create a new field.

The :term:`Realm Object Model` for each synced collection of your synced
cluster should include the partition key for your application. However,
you don't have to include the partition key in all collections; Realm
sync will ignore any collections that lack a Realm Object Model as well as any
documents that lack a valid value for the partition key.

Partition Values
----------------

Each unique :term:`partition value`, or value of a partition key, maps
to a different Realm. Documents that share the same partition value
belong to the same Realm. All documents in a Realm share the same
read and write permissions.

Map Documents to Realms
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Since all documents that share the same partition value also share the
same permissions for each user, you should select a key whose unique values
correspond with permissions within your application. Consider which documents
each user needs to read, and which documents each user needs to write. What
separates one user's data from another? The concepts of ownership
(which users can change which data?) and access (which users can see
which data?) decide how you should partition your data.

.. _partition-strategies:

Partition Strategies
--------------------

Most applications access data in similar ways. A few common patterns,
applied individually or in combination, cover a vast majority of Realm
permissioning use cases:

- **User Realms**: If your application stores data privately for each
  individual user, you could create an ``owner_id`` field containing a
  specific user ID for every document. Selecting the ``owner_id``
  field as your partition key would partition your database into Realms
  corresponding to individual users.
     
- **Team Realms**: If your application shares resources across teams,
  you could create a ``teams`` collection that maps user IDs to team
  IDs. You could then create a ``team_id`` field containing a specific
  team ID for every document you want to sync. Selecting the ``team_id``
  field as your partition key would partition your database into Realms
  containing data for entire teams.

- **Public Realms**: It's often helpful to store read-only data viewable
  to all users; for this kind of use case, you can define a special
  partition value in your permissions, such as ``PUBLIC``, that all
  users sync with read permissions only.

You can combine these partitioning strategies to create applications
that make some data publicly available, like announcements or an
organizational chart, but restrict other data to privileged users.

To combine strategies, you can use a generic partition key field name
like ``_partitionKey`` with a partition value structured like a query
string. For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   _partitionKey: "team_id=1234"
   _partitionKey: "user_id=abcdefg"

You can use Realm rule expressions can check the prefix before looking
up the team or user ID in the appropriate lookup collection to determine
whether or not a given user has access to a Realm. Structuring your
partition values like a query string lets you take
advantage of multiple partitioning strategies at once, providing the
power of user, team, and public realms all at once. See the
:ref:`partition key examples <partition-key-examples>` for more
information about partitioning strategies.

.. _partition-key-limitations:

Partitioning Limitations
-------------------------

Partition keys and values are subject to certain limitations:

.. _partition-limitations-types:

- Partition keys must be one of the following types:

  - String

  - ObjectID

  - Int

  - Long

- Once you have chosen a partition key and enabled sync, you cannot
  reassign the partition key to a different field. To use a different
  field as your partition key:
  
  1) Disable Realm sync.
  
  2) Enable Realm sync again with the new field selected as your
     partition key.
     
  .. warning::

     Disabling and re-enabling sync will trigger a
     :ref:`client reset <client-reset>` on all clients.

- Once you have chosen a partition key and enabled sync, you cannot
  change the name of the field you selected as your partition key. To
  alter the field name of your partition key:

  1) Disable Realm sync.
  
  2) Change the field name.

  3) Enable Realm sync again with the updated field name selected as
     your partition key.

  .. warning::

     Disabling and re-enabling sync will trigger a
     :ref:`client reset <client-reset>` on all clients.

- If you change a partition value in Atlas, MongoDB Realm interprets
  the change as a delete, then an insert. First, MongoDB Realm deletes
  the corresponding :term:`Realm object` from the object's original
  Realm. Next, MongoDB Realm inserts a new Realm object containing the
  same data into the object's new Realm. 
  
  .. warning::

     Changing a partition value in Atlas will lose any un-synced client
     updates to the object.

- Changing a partition value in a Realm object using the Realm SDK
  will throw an error and trigger a :ref:`client reset <client-reset>`.

.. _partition-key-examples:

Partitioning Examples
---------------------

Because Realms correspond to collections of documents that share the
same permissions, partitioning can vary between Realm apps.

Example: Partitioning by User
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Consider the following documents in three MongoDB collections
describing user data in a music app:

.. code-block:: javascript

   collection playlists: [
      { name: "Work", owner_id: "dog_enthusiast_95", song_ids: [ ... ] }
      { name: "Party", owner_id: "cat_enthusiast_92", song_ids: [ ... ] }
      { name: "Dance", owner_id: "troll_2", song_ids: [ ... ] }
      { name: "Soup Tunes", owner_id: "dog_enthusiast_95", song_ids: [ ... ] }
      { name: "Disco Anthems", owner_id: "PUBLIC", song_ids: [ ... ] }
      { name: "Deep Focus", owner_id: "PUBLIC", song_ids: [ ... ] }
   ]

   collection follows: [
      { owner_id: "dog_enthusiast_95", playlist_ids: [ ... ] }
      { owner_id: "cat_enthusiast_92", playlist_ids: [ ... ] }
      { owner_id: "troll_2", playlist_ids: [ ... ] }
      { owner_id: "OP", playlist_ids: [ ... ] }
   ]

   collection dispositions: [
      { owner_id: "dog_enthusiast_95", song_id: 3, rating: -1 }
      { owner_id: "cat_enthusiast_92", song_id: 1, rating: 1 }
      { owner_id: "troll_2", song_id: 2, rating: 1 }
      { owner_id: "dog_enthusiast_95", song_id: 1, rating: 1 }
   ]

In this application, the ``owner_id`` field is a good candidate for a
partition key. This field works well as a partition key because it
splits documents into Realms that make sense given user permissions
and it makes it easy for users to sync a limited number of Realms:

- Every user has read and write access to the Realm
  containing objects owned by them -- playlists they've made and song
  ratings.
   
- Every user has read access to the Realm for partition value
  ``PUBLIC``, which contains all playlists that are available to all
  users.

- Users sync to two Realms: the Realm for the partition value
  corresponding to their user ID, and the Realm for the ``PUBLIC``
  partition value. This minimizes data synced over the network to
  only the data relevant for each Realm user.

Partitioning this data by ``owner_id`` results in the following
Realms:

.. code-block:: javascript

   Realm dog_enthusiast_95: [
      { owner_id: "dog_enthusiast_95", playlist_ids: [ ... ] }
      { name: "Work", owner_id: "dog_enthusiast_95", song_ids: [ ... ] }
      { name: "Soup Tunes", owner_id: "dog_enthusiast_95", song_ids: [ ... ] }
      { owner_id: "dog_enthusiast_95", song_id: 3, rating: -1 }
      { owner_id: "dog_enthusiast_95", song_id: 1, rating: 1 }
   ]

   Realm cat_enthusiast_92: [
      { owner_id: "cat_enthusiast_92", playlist_ids: [ ... ] }
      { name: "Party", owner_id: "cat_enthusiast_92", song_ids: [ ... ] }
      { owner_id: "cat_enthusiast_92", song_id: 1, rating: 1 }
   ]

   Realm troll_2: [
      { owner_id: "troll_2", playlist_ids: [ ... ] }
      { owner_id: "troll_2", song_id: 2, rating: 1 }
      { name: "Dance", owner_id: "troll_2", song_ids: [ ... ] }
   ]

   Realm OP: [
      { owner_id: "OP", playlist_ids: [ ... ] }
   ]

   Realm PUBLIC: [
      { name: "Disco Anthems", owner_id: "PUBLIC", song_ids: [ ... ] }
      { name: "Deep Focus", owner_id: "PUBLIC", song_ids: [ ... ] }
   ]

Example: Partitioning Data Across Groups
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Consider the following documents in MongoDB collections
describing inventory and sales at a paper company:

.. code-block:: javascript

   collection branches: [
      { name: "Scranton", partitionKey: "PUBLIC", salespeople: [ "Jim", "Pam", "Dwight" ] }
      { name: "Albany", partitionKey: "PUBLIC", salespeople: [ "Karen" ] }
      { name: "Utica", partitionKey: "PUBLIC", salespeople: [ "Jeff" ] }
      { name: "Yonkers", partitionKey: "PUBLIC", salespeople: [ "Arnold" ] }
   ]

   collection inventory: [
      { type: "A4", partitionKey: "branch=Scranton", volume: 326}
      { type: "A4", partitionKey: "branch=Albany", volume: 567}
      { type: "A4", partitionKey: "branch=Utica", volume: 48}
   ]

   collection sales: [
      { item: "A4", partitionKey: "salesperson=Jim", volume: 33, customer: "school" }
      { item: "A4", partitionKey: "salesperson=Karen", volume: 78, customer: "law firm" }
      { item: "A4", partitionKey: "salesperson=Jim", volume: 57, customer: "gym" }
      { item: "A4", partitionKey: "salesperson=Jeff", volume: 15, customer: "mom" }
      { item: "A4", partitionKey: "salesperson=Arnold", volume: 54, customer: "dad" }
   ]

   collection delivery: [
      { item: "A4", partitionKey: "delivery_truck=3", volume: 33, customer: "school" }
      { item: "A4", partitionKey: "delivery_truck=3", volume: 57, customer: "gym" }
      { item: "A4", partitionKey: "delivery_truck=7", volume: 12, customer: "law firm" }
   ]

   collection catalog: [
      { item: "A4", partitionKey: "PUBLIC", price: .25 }
      { item: "A5", partitionKey: "PUBLIC", price: .75 }
      { item: "legal", partitionKey: "PUBLIC", price: .35 }
      { item: "panama", partitionKey: "PRIVATE", price: 1.05 }
   ]

   collection leads: [
      { customer: "yellow pages", contact: "123-456-7890", partitionKey: "branch=Scranton" }
      { customer: "newspaper", contact: "456-456-7890", partitionKey: "branch=Scranton" }
      { customer: "diner", contact: "345-623-5467", partitionKey: "branch=Albany" }
      { customer: "mom", contact: "342-576-6733", partitionKey: "salesperson=Jeff" }
      { customer: "NYSDEC", contact: "145-674-7890", partitionKey: "branch=Utica" }
   ]

For this data, there is no single collection of owners -- depending
on the collection, data might be owned by:

- a branch of the company, such as Scranton

- a salesperson, such as Jim

- a delivery truck, such as truck number 7

- the company in general, public or private

To partition this data into Realms, you can create partition keys
containing prefixes that indicate which kind of entity owns the data.
In this case, the application uses the categories of branch,
salesperson, delivery truck, or public/private. You can also create
a unique ID for each entity across categories and map those IDs in a
separate entity metadata collection.

It makes sense to partition data in this way because it separates
data into groups of documents with the same permissions.
Additionally, clients only sync a small number of relevant Realms for
each use case:

- A mobile client assigned to a delivery truck has read and write
  access to the inventory of their delivery truck, and syncs
  the Realm correponding to their delivery truck's ID. No other
  information is relevant for that delivery truck, so they only
  access the information they need.

- Every salesperson has read and write access to their own sales data
  and syncs the Realm corresponding to their own sales data.

- Every branch warehouse can read and write data in their own
  inventory Realm.

- Every user can read public company information located in the
  ``PUBLIC`` Realm, and only company administrators can read and
  write public or private company information.

- Because most users only read and write to one or two Realms, this
  partitioning scheme only exposes data to those who need it. The
  partitioning remains flexible enough to accommodate future
  features.


Partitioning this data by ``partitionKey`` results in the following
Realms:

.. code-block:: javascript

   Realm PUBLIC: [
      { name: "Scranton", partitionKey: "PUBLIC", salespeople: [ "Jim", "Pam", "Dwight" ] }
      { name: "Albany", partitionKey: "PUBLIC", salespeople: [ "Karen" ] }
      { name: "Utica", partitionKey: "PUBLIC", salespeople: [ "Jeff" ] }
      { name: "Yonkers", partitionKey: "PUBLIC", salespeople: [ "Arnold" ] }
      { item: "A4", partitionKey: "PUBLIC", price: .25 }
      { item: "A5", partitionKey: "PUBLIC", price: .75 }
      { item: "legal", partitionKey: "PUBLIC", price: .35 }
   ]

   ]

   Realm delivery_truck=7: [
      { item: "A4", partitionKey: "delivery_truck=7", volume: 12, customer: "law firm" }
   ]

Overview
--------

In modern applications, users expect their data to be accurate no matter
which device or browser they connect from. Data modeling ensures the
accuracy of application data by performing type and format checks on
fields. 


MongoDB Realm allows you to define, synchronize, and enforce your data
model in two formats: 

- :doc:`Realm Schema </mongodb/document-schemas>`, which defines your data as MongoDB documents to enforce validation and synchronization in the cloud.

- :term:`{+service-short+} data model`, which defines your data as native objects in your mobile application.

Having these two forms of data models allows your data to be consistent
and :doc:`synced</sync>` regardless of which clients
write the data. 


Approaches
----------

There are two alternative approaches to configuring both data models: 

- :ref:`Create a Realm Object Model from a Realm Schema <create-rom-from-schema>`: If you have data in your `{+atlas+} <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?tck=docs_realm>`_ cluster already, MongoDB generates a Realm Schema by sampling your data. MongoDB Realm can then translate that Realm Schema into a Realm Object Model to use in your mobile application. 

- :ref:`Create a Realm Schema from a Realm Object Model <create-schema-from-rom>`: Alternatively, if you are developing mobile-first and do not already have data in your Atlas cluster, you can translate your Realm Object Model into a Realm Schema for use with Atlas. Regardless of the approach that you take, when you configure both your Atlas cluster and Mobile application to use the respective data model, changes to the data model between the server and client are auto-updated.

Summary
-------
- MongoDB Realm uses two different data models: a Realm Object Model for mobile and a Realm Schema for Atlas. Changes to one data model match the other data model. 
- If you already have data in Atlas, MongoDB Realm creates a Realm Schema by sampling that data. That Realm Schema can be translated into a Realm Object Model to be used in your Realm mobile application code. 
- If you do not have data in Atlas or are developing with a mobile-first approach, you can turn on :guilabel:`Development Mode` to allow for data model changes from a Realm mobile client. When you finish developing your Realm Object Model, you can turn off :guilabel:`Development Mode`, and your Realm Schema will be auto-updated with your updated data model configuration. Atlas will begin using this updated data model configuration for data validation on your cluster immediately.

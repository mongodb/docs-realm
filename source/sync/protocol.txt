Overview
--------

{+service+} uses a protocol to correctly and efficiently sync data changes in
real time across multiple clients that each maintain their own local
{+service-short+} files. The protocol defines a set of pre-defined :ref:`request
types <sync-request-types>` as well as a :ref:`process <sync-session-process>`
by which a client, like a {+service-short+} SDK, can connect to a
{+service-short+} application server and sync data.

.. note::
   
   The {+service-short+} SDKs internally implement and manage the sync protocol,
   so for most applications you don't need to understand the sync protocol to
   use {+service-short+}. This page covers the protocol at a high level and is
   not an implementation spec.

Key Concepts
------------

.. _changesets:

Changeset
~~~~~~~~~

A **changeset** is a list of instructions that describe granular modifications
made to a known object state or version by one or more write operations.
Changesets are the base unit of the sync protocol. Synced {+realm+} clients send
changesets to the {+service-short+} server whenever they perform a write
operation. The server sends each connected client the changesets for write
operations executed by other clients.

The {+service-short+} sync server accepts changesets from any connected sync
client (including changes in a synced MongoDB cluster) at any time and uses an
operational transformation algorithm to serialize changes into a linear order
and resolve conflicting changesets before sending them to connected clients.

.. _operational-transformations:

Operational Transformation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An **operational transformation** is a function that, given two changesets,
produces a third changeset that represents logically applying one of the given
changesets after the other. {+service-short+} uses operational transformation to
resolve conflicts between changesets from different sync clients that apply to
the same base state.

{+service-short+} is an offline-first local database even when sync is enabled,
which means that any device may perform offline writes and upload the
corresponding changesets later when network connectivity is re-established. The
operational transformation algorithm is designed to gracefully handle changesets
that arrive "out of order" with respect to the logical server clock such that
every synced {+service-short+} file converges to the same version of each
changed object.

.. tip::
   
   An operational transformation on {+service-short+} changesets is analogous to
   a :git-scm:`rebase operation <docs/git-rebase>` in Git.

.. _client-file-identifier:

Client File Identifier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **client file identifier** is a value that uniquely identifies a synced client
{+service-short+} file and its corresponding server file. The server generates a
client file identifier whenever an SDK requests one during its initial sync of a
{+service-short+} file. Each identifier is a 64-bit, non-zero, positive signed
integer strictly less than 2^63.

.. note::
   
   The server guarantees that all identifiers generated on behalf of a
   particular server file are unique with respect to each other. The server is
   free to generate identical identifiers for two client files if they are
   associated with different server files.

.. _sync-session-process:

Sync Session Process
--------------------

To initiate, execute, and terminate a {+service-short+} Database sync session, a
{+service-short+} SDK and application server send and receive a set of
protocol-specific requests.

The SDK negotiates a WebSocket connection over HTTP and then establishes a sync
session by sending :sync-client-message:`BIND` and :sync-client-message:`IDENT`
requests to the server over the WebSocket connections. Once the session is
established, the SDK and server send synced changesets for a given
{+service-short+} file to each other via :sync-client-message:`UPLOAD` and
:sync-server-message:`DOWNLOAD` messages. To end the session, the SDK sends an
:sync-client-message:`UNBIND` request.

Request Types
-------------

.. _sync-request-types-client-to-server:

Client -> Server Messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following table describes the request types that a sync client can send to a
{+service-short+} server:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70
   
   * - Request
     - Description
   
   * - .. sync-client-message:: BIND
     - Starts a new sync session on the server and provides a signed
       authorization token for the current application user. If the client does
       not yet possess a :ref:`client file identifier <client-file-identifier>`
       for the {+service-short+} file it wants to sync, this also indicates that
       the server should generate one and send it back to the client.
       
       A client must send a BIND before it can send any other requests.
   
   * - .. sync-client-message:: IDENT
     - Provides the :ref:`client file identifier <client-file-identifier>` that
       indicates the following:
       
       - the {+service-short+} file to sync
       - the client {+realm+}'s current version
       - the client {+realm+}'s most recently synced server version
       
       This request is related to but distinct from the
       :sync-server-message:`IDENT` message sent by the server when a client
       requests a client file identifier.
   
   * - .. sync-client-message:: UPLOAD
     - Specifies one or more :ref:`changesets <changesets>` for operations that
       occurred on the client. The changesets are listed by client version in
       increasing order.
   
   * - .. sync-client-message:: TRANSACT
     - Specifies a :ref:`changeset <changesets>` that describes a serialized
       transaction that occurred on the client. The client may not upload any
       other changesets until the server confirms or rejects the transaction.
   
   * - .. sync-client-message:: UNBIND
     - Ends a running sync session.
       
       A client may not send any other requests for an
       :sync-server-message:`UNBOUND` session.
   
   * - .. sync-client-message:: MARK
     - Requests that the server notify the client when it has synced the latest
       :ref:`changeset <changesets>` in the server history (at the time of the
       request).
   
   * - .. sync-client-message:: REFRESH
     - Re-authorizes a current sync session with a new user token.
   
   * - .. sync-client-message:: STATE_REQUEST
     - Requests that the server send one or more :sync-server-message:`STATE`
       messages, which the client uses to download the current server version of
       the {+service-short+} file. Clients issue state requests when they
       asynchronously open a synced {+realm+}.
   
   * - .. sync-client-message:: CLIENT_VERSION_REQUEST
     - Requests that the server send the client version of the latest changeset
       that was sent by the client and processed by the server. This is most
       commonly used when an SDK executes a :term:`client reset`.
   
   * - .. sync-client-message:: PING
     - Indicates that the client is still connected and that the server should
       maintain the sync session. A client must send at least one PING to the
       server every 10 minutes. The server acknowledges to each PING with a
       :sync-server-message:`PONG`.
       
       If the server has not received a PING from a client in more than 10
       minutes, it considers the client to be disconnected and may automatically
       end the session.

.. _sync-request-types-server-to-client:

Server -> Client Messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following table describes the request types that the {+service-short+}
server can send to a sync client:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70
   
   * - Request
     - Description
   
   * - .. sync-server-message:: IDENT
     - Provides a :ref:`client file identifier <client-file-identifier>` that
       the server generated in response to a :sync-client-message:`BIND` that
       requested the identifier.
   
   * - .. sync-server-message:: DOWNLOAD
     - Specifies one or more :ref:`changesets <changesets>` (up to 16MB total)
       for operations that occurred on other clients. The changesets are listed
       by server version in increasing order.
       
       The changesets in a DOWNLOAD may not be the exact changesets uploaded by
       other clients. Instead, they may be equivalent changesets output by
       {+service-short+}'s :ref:`operational transformation
       <operational-transformations>` algorithm.
   
   * - .. sync-server-message:: UNBOUND
     - Specifies that the server ended a sync session in response to an
       :sync-client-message:`UNBIND`.
   
   * - .. sync-server-message:: TRANSACT
     - Indicates whether or not the server successfully processed a changeset
       specified in a :sync-client-message:`TRANSACT` from the client.
   
   * - .. sync-server-message:: MARK
     - Indicates that the server has sent the client the latest
       :ref:`changeset <changesets>` that was in the server history when the
       server received a :sync-client-message:`MARK` from the client.
   
   * - .. sync-server-message:: STATE
     - Contains one or more segments of encoded data that the client can
       concatenate to construct the latest server version of the {+realm+}. Sent
       in response to a :sync-client-message:`STATE_REQUEST`.
   
   * - .. sync-server-message:: CLIENT_VERSION
     - Specifies the client version of the latest changeset that was sent by the
       client and processed by the server. Sent in response to a
       :sync-client-message:`CLIENT_VERSION_REQUEST`.
   
   * - .. sync-server-message:: ERROR
     - Indicates that the server encountered an issue that appears to have been
       caused by the connected client.
   
   * - .. sync-server-message:: PONG
     - Acknowledges a :sync-client-message:`PING`. If a client does not receive
       a PONG acknowledgement, it indicates that the client cannot currently
       communicate with the server over the network and that the server may not
       have received the corresponding :sync-client-message:`PING`.

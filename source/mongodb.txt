Overview
--------

{+service+} provides a first-class service interface for `{+atlas+}
<https://www.mongodb.com/realm?tck=realm-docs#atlas-form-container>`_ that lets you
securely query one or more {+atlas-short+} data sources. You can use
standard MongoDB query language syntax to access your data directly in
your client application code or from a :doc:`{+service-short+} Function
</functions>`.

The :ref:`MongoDB service <mongodb-service>` secures your data with a
dynamic, role-based :guilabel:`Rules` engine that proxies and modifies
incoming queries
based on rules that you define. There are three types of MongoDB
collection rules: :ref:`roles <mongodb-roles>`, :ref:`filters
<mongodb-filters>`, and :ref:`{+backend-schema+} <mongodb-schemas>`.

Get Started
~~~~~~~~~~~

To get started with the MongoDB service, :doc:`link a data source to
your application </mongodb/link-a-data-source>` and :doc:`define roles
and permissions </mongodb/define-roles-and-permissions>` for a
collection. After you've created at least one role, you can start to
work with data in the collection.

Concepts
--------

.. _crud-aggregation-operations:

CRUD & Aggregation Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+service+} allows you to securely work with data in a {+atlas+} cluster
directly from your client applications and :doc:`Functions </functions>`
using standard, platform-idiomatic MongoDB query syntax. You can also
access a linked `{+atlas+} Data Lake
<https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/data-lake?tck=docs_realm>`_ from a
:ref:`system function <system-functions>`.

The following guides demonstrate how to use :doc:`MongoDB service
actions </mongodb/actions>` to work with data in a :ref:`linked data
source <link-a-data-source>`:

- :doc:`Insert Documents </mongodb/insert-documents>`
- :doc:`Find Documents </mongodb/find-documents>`
- :doc:`Update Documents </mongodb/update-documents>`
- :doc:`Delete Documents </mongodb/delete-documents>`
- :doc:`Watch for Document Changes </mongodb/watch-documents>`
- :doc:`Run Aggregation Pipelines </mongodb/run-aggregation-pipelines>`
- :doc:`Bulk Writes </mongodb/bulk-write>`

.. important:: Define Collection Rules

   When working with a linked {+atlas+} cluster outside of a
   :ref:`system function <system-functions>`, {+backend+} dynamically
   determines which documents and fields in a collection each
   :doc:`application user </authentication>` can read and write for all
   incoming query operations by evaluating :ref:`collection rules
   <mongodb-rules>` that you define.

   **If you do not define rules for a collection, queries on
   the collection will fail.**   

.. note:: Advanced MongoDB Queries

   {+service+} does not support all MongoDB CRUD and Aggregation
   operations when you query MongoDB as a specific
   :doc:`user </authentication>`. You can bypass this limitation by
   querying MongoDB from a :term:`system function` that
   runs as the :ref:`system user <system-user>`, which has
   access to the full MongoDB CRUD and Aggregation APIs.

   For more information on which operations are unsupported,
   see :doc:`CRUD & Aggregation APIs
   </mongodb/crud-and-aggregation-apis>`.

.. _mongodb-rules:

Collection Rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In traditional applications, an application server exposes
an API to client applications and handles database queries
on their behalf. To prevent malicious, improper, or
incorrect read and write operations, clients don't query the
database directly.

{+service+} provides a configurable and dynamic rules engine that
enables you to run a MongoDB query from client applications
while transparently preventing unauthorized reads and
writes. Rules are defined for entire collections in a linked
MongoDB Atlas cluster and apply to individual documents in
the collection dynamically based on the :doc:`application
user </authentication>` that issued a query.

.. include:: /includes/data-lake-rules-note.rst

The rules engine handles incoming queries with the following 4-step
process:

.. include:: /includes/steps/mdb-rules-process.rst

Considerations
--------------

System-Generated Cluster Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+service+} automatically creates a :manual:`MongoDB user
</core/security-users>` for each app linked to a cluster.
These users are for internal use only and cannot be edited
or manually deleted. If you delete a {+app+}, the
associated user will also be deleted.

Users generated by {+service+} have names of the form:
``mongodb-realm-<your app id>``

Accessing Application Data with Another Tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+service+} connects to standard MongoDB Atlas clusters, which
means that you can connect directly to a :term:`linked cluster`
using another tool such as the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell or
{+compass+}. There are no special considerations when reading
data from a linked cluster with another tool.

While running update operations, {+backend+} temporarily adds a
reserved field, ``_id_realm_transaction``, to documents.
Once a document is successfully updated, {+backend+} removes this
field. If you want to use another tool to modify data in a
collection, ensure that you :manual:`$unset
</reference/operator/update/unset>` this field prior to
making changes.

For example, if you are using the :manual:`mongo </mongo>` shell to
update documents in the products collection, your command
might resemble the following code:

.. code-block:: sh
   :emphasize-lines: 3

   db.products.update(
      { sku: "unknown" },
      { $unset: { _id_realm_transaction: "" } }
   )

.. _realm-sync-data-consistency:

Realm Sync Schema Data Consistency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the collection in which you create and modify objects is also accessed by  
:ref:`{+sync+} clients <sync>`, you must ensure that the data conforms to the 
{+service-short+} :ref:`object schema <object-schema>` defined on the collection. 
Consider the following scenario:

- You have a collection of objects that is used by {+sync+} clients. The 
  **object schema** for the collection looks like this:

  .. code-block:: js
     :copyable: false

     type Person = {
       _id: BSON.ObjectId;
       name: string;
       address: string;
       age: number;
     };
  
- Using a {+service-short+} client (say, {+compass+}), you create and insert a 
  document into the collection. The ``age`` property of this document has a 
  value of "forty two". 
  
- Because of MongoDB's flexible schema, there is no error when inserting the 
  document. However, because the the Sync object schema defines the ``age`` 
  property as type ``number``, the object fails schema validation and is not 
  pushed to Sync.

- The collection is now divergent: Sync clients do not see the new document, but 
  {+service+} clients do. 

The same scenario holds true if a valid document is modified outside of {+sync+}  
such that one or more properties no longer conform to the Sync schema. 

Any document that fails the object schema validation is added to the 
``__realm_sync.unsynced_documents`` collection (along with the reason for the 
failure) and will also be logged in the 
Realm UI ``Logs`` console. If there are 100,000 or more documents that can't be 
synced, the Realm app is paused.

.. important::

   You can read from the ``__realm_sync.unsynced_documents`` collection, but you 
   should not modify it in any way.

To fix this problem, you must **replace** the invalid document with one that 
conforms to the object model. Updating the existing document will not add it to 
Sync. 

**Summary**
  If your data is used by Sync clients but can also be created or 
  modified outside of Realm Sync, you must ensure those creations and modifications 
  match the defined object schema on the collection. For documents that have 
  failed, you must replace the entire document before it can sync.

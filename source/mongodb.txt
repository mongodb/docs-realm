Overview
--------

Realm provides a first-class service interface for MongoDB Atlas that
lets you securely query one or more Atlas clusters. You can use standard
MongoDB query language syntax to access your data directly in your
client application code or from a Realm :doc:`Function </functions>`.

The MongoDB service secures your data with a dynamic, role-based
:guilabel:`Rules` engine that proxies and modifies incoming queries
based on rules that you define. There are three types of MongoDB
collection rules: :ref:`roles <mongodb-roles>`, :ref:`filters
<mongodb-filters>`, and :ref:`document schemas <mongodb-schemas>`.

Get Started
~~~~~~~~~~~

To get started with the MongoDB service, :doc:`link a cluster to your
application </mongodb/link-a-cluster>` and :doc:`define roles and
permissions </mongodb/define-roles-and-permissions>` for a collection.
After you've created at least one role, you can start to work with data
in the collection.

Concepts
--------

.. _crud-aggregation-operations:

CRUD & Aggregation Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Realm allows you to securely work with data in a MongoDB Atlas cluster
directly from your client applications and :doc:`Functions </functions>`
using standard, platform-idiomatic MongoDB query syntax.

The following guides demonstrate how to use :doc:`MongoDB service
actions </mongodb/mongodb-actions>` to work with data in a linked
cluster:

- :doc:`Add Data to MongoDB </mongodb/add-data-to-mongodb>`
- :doc:`Find Documents in MongoDB </mongodb/find-documents-in-mongodb>`
- :doc:`Update Documents in MongoDB </mongodb/update-documents-in-mongodb>`
- :doc:`Delete Documents from MongoDB </mongodb/delete-documents-from-mongodb>`
- :doc:`Watch for Document Changes </mongodb/watch-for-document-changes>`
- :doc:`Run Aggregation Pipelines </mongodb/run-aggregation-pipelines>`

.. admonition:: Define Collection Rules
   :class: important

   Realm dynamically determines which documents and fields
   in a collection each :doc:`application user </users>` can
   read and write for all incoming query operations by
   evaluating :ref:`collection rules <mongodb-rules>` that
   you define.

   **If you do not define rules for a collection, queries on
   the collection will fail.**

.. admonition:: Advanced MongoDB Queries
   :class: note

   Realm does not support all MongoDB CRUD and Aggregation
   operations when you query MongoDB as a specific
   :doc:`user </users>`. You can bypass this limitation by
   querying MongoDB from a :doc:`Function </functions>` that
   runs as the :ref:`system user <system-user>`, which has
   access to the full MongoDB CRUD and Aggregation APIs.

   For more information on which operations are unsupported,
   see :doc:`CRUD & Aggregation APIs
   </mongodb/crud-and-aggregation-apis>`.

.. _mongodb-rules:

Collection Rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In traditional applications, an application server exposes
an API to client applications and handles database queries
on their behalf. To prevent malicious, improper, or
incorrect read and write operations, clients don't query the
database directly.

Realm provides a configurable and dynamic rules engine that
enables you to run a MongoDB query from client applications
while transparently preventing unauthorized reads and
writes. Rules are defined for entire collections in a linked
MongoDB Atlas cluster and apply to individual documents in
the collection dynamically based on the :doc:`application
user </users>` that issued a query.

The rules engine handles incoming queries with the following 4-step
process:

.. include:: /includes/steps/mdb-rules-process.rst

Considerations
--------------

System-Generated Cluster Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Realm automatically creates a :manual:`MongoDB user
</core/security-users>` for each app linked to a cluster.
These users are for internal use only and cannot be edited
or manually deleted. If you delete a Realm app, the
associated user will also be deleted.

Users generated by Realm have names of the form:
``mongodb-realm-<your app id>``

Accessing Application Data with Another Tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Realm connects to standard MongoDB Atlas clusters, which
means that you can connect directly to a linked cluster
using another tool such as the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell or
|compass|_. There are no special considerations when reading
data from a linked cluster with another tool.

While running update operations, Realm temporarily adds a
reserved field, ``_id_realm_transaction``, to documents.
Once a document is successfully updated, Realm removes this
field. If you want to use another tool to modify data in a
collection, ensure that you :manual:`$unset
</reference/operator/update/unset>` this field prior to
making changes.

For example, if you are using the :program:`mongo` shell to
update documents in the products collection, your command
might resemble the following code:

.. code-block:: sh
   :emphasize-lines: 3

   db.products.update(
      { sku: "unknown" },
      { $unset: { _id_realm_transaction: "" } }
   )

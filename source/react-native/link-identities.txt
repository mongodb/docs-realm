Link User Identities
====================

Overview
--------

{+service+} provides :ref:`multiple ways <authentication-providers>` for users
to log into your application. Because each method of authentication corresponds
to a unique user identity, {+service-short+} lets you merge multiple identities
corresponding to a single user into one user identity.

Example
-------

For instance, consider an application that enables users to authenticate via
:ref:`anonymous authentication <anonymous-authentication>` so they may explore
functionality without linking to an existing SSO provider or generating a new
password. When that user finally decides to create a full account with an SSO
provider or email/password authentication, you need some way of persisting the
user's original anonymous identity with their new permanent identity.

You can link identities using the :js-sdk:`linkCredentials()
<Realm.User.html#linkCredentials>` method  
of the ``User`` object of a logged-in User.

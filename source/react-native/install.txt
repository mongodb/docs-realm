Overview
--------

The {+service+} React Native SDK enables development of `React
Native <https://facebook.github.io/react-native/>`__
applications using the JavaScript and `TypeScript
<https://www.typescriptlang.org/>`__ languages. React Native
enables you to build cross-platform iOS and Android apps
with a single codebase using the `React
<https://reactjs.org/>`__ framework.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before getting started, ensure your development environment
meets the following prerequisites:

- React Native v0.31.0 or later. Follow the `official React Native CLI Quickstart instructions <https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html>`__ to set up your environment.
- `CocoaPods <https://cocoapods.org/>`__ (recommended for building an iOS app with React Native v.60+).

.. important:: Expo does not support Realm

   Unfortunately, `Expo does not support {+service-short+}
   <https://expo.canny.io/feature-requests/p/support-for-realm>`__.
   If you use the Expo CLI or ``create-react-native-app`` to
   create your React Native project, you will need to
   "eject" your Expo project to use {+service-short+}. The installation
   steps on this page do not use the Expo CLI.


Installation
------------

Select the tab below that corresponds to your React Native
version. Follow the steps to create a React Native project
and add the {+service-short+} React Native SDK to it.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: React Native v.60+
      :tabid: rn-v-60-plus

      .. include:: /includes/steps/install-react-native-v60-plus.rst

   .. tab:: Older React Native Versions
      :tabid: rn-pre-v-60

      .. include:: /includes/steps/install-react-native-pre-v60.rst

Import Realm
------------

Add the following line to the top of your source files where
you want to use {+service+}:

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: javascript

      .. code-block:: javascript

         import Realm from "realm";

   .. tab::
      :tabid: typescript

      .. code-block:: typescript

         import Realm from "realm";

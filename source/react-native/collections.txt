Overview
--------

One of the fundamental building blocks when working with any
database is the **collection**. A {+service-short+} collection is an
object that contains zero or more instances of one
:ref:`{+service-short+} type <react-native-realm-objects>`. {+service-short+} collections
are homogenous, i.e. all objects in a collection are of the
same type.

You can filter and sort any collection using {+client-database+}'s
:ref:`query engine <react-native-client-query-engine>`. Collections are
:ref:`live <react-native-live-object>`, so they always reflect the
current state of the :term:`{+realm+} instance` on the current
thread. You can also listen for changes in the collection by subscribing
to :ref:`collection notifications <react-native-collection-notifications>`.

{+client-database+} has two kinds of collections: **lists** and **results**.

.. _react-native-list-collections:

List Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **list collection** represents a :ref:`to-many
relationship <react-native-to-many-relationship>` between two {+service-short+}
types. Lists are mutable: within a write transaction, you
can add and remove elements on a list. Lists are not
associated with a query.

.. _react-native-results-collections:

Results Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **results collection** represents the lazily-evaluated
results of a query operation. Results are immutable: you
cannot add or remove elements on the results collection.
Results have an associated query that determines their
contents.

.. _react-native-live-collections:

Collections are Live
--------------------

Like :ref:`live objects <react-native-live-object>`, {+service-short+} collections
are usually **live**:

- Live results collections always reflect the current results of the associated query.
- Live lists always reflect the current state of the relationship on the {+realm+} instance.

There are three cases when a collection is **not** live:

- The collection is unmanaged, e.g. a List property of a {+service-short+} object that has not been added to a {+realm+} yet or that has been copied from a {+realm+}.
- The collection is part of a snapshot.

Combined with :ref:`collection notifications
<react-native-collection-notifications>`, live collections enable clean,
reactive code. For example, suppose your view displays the
results of a query. You can keep a reference to the results
collection in your view class, then read the results
collection as needed without having to refresh it or
validate that it is up-to-date.

.. important:: Indexes may change

   Since results update themselves automatically, do not
   store the positional index of an object in the collection
   or the count of objects in a collection. The stored index
   or count value could be outdated by the time you use
   it.

.. _react-native-lazy-evaluated-results:

Results are Lazily Evaluated
----------------------------

{+client-database+} only runs a query when you actually request the
results of that query, e.g. by accessing elements of the
results collection. This lazy evaluation enables you to
write elegant, highly performant code for handling large
data sets and complex queries.

.. _react-native-limiting-results:

Limiting Query Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As a result of lazy evaluation, you do not need any special
mechanism to limit query results with {+client-database+}. For example, if
your query matches thousands of objects, but you only want
to load the first ten, simply access only the first ten
elements of the results collection.

.. _react-native-pagination:

Pagination
~~~~~~~~~~

Thanks to lazy evaluation, the common task of pagination
becomes quite simple. For example, suppose you have a
results collection associated with a query that matches
thousands of objects in your {+realm+}. You display one hundred
objects per page. To advance to any page, simply access the
elements of the results collection starting at the index
that corresponds to the target page.

.. _react-native-list-vs-results:

List vs. Results
----------------

When you need a collection, you can use the following rule
of thumb to determine whether a list or a results collection
is appropriate:

- When you define the properties of your {+service-short+} objects, use lists to define :ref:`to-many relationships <react-native-to-many-relationship>` except :ref:`implicit inverse relationships <react-native-inverse-relationship>`.
- Use results everywhere else.

To understand these different use cases, consider whether
you should be able to add or remove objects directly. Lists
allow you to add and remove objects directly, because you
control the relationships. Results collections do not allow
you to add or remove objects directly, because their contents
are determined by a query.

.. example::

   Consider a {+service-short+} type called Person with a field called
   ``emails`` that is a collection of strings representing
   email addresses. You control this data. Your application
   needs to add and remove email addresses from your Person
   instances. Therefore, use a **list** to define the field
   type of ``emails``.

   On the other hand, when you query the {+realm+} for all
   Persons over the age of 25, it would not make sense for
   you to add or remove Persons directly to the resulting
   collection. The contents of that collection only change
   when the query matches a different set of Persons.
   Therefore, {+client-database+} gives you a **results** collection.

.. _react-native-collection-type-for-implicit-inverse-relationships:

.. note:: Inverse one-to-many relationship property exception

   Since {+client-database+} automatically determines the contents of
   :ref:`implicit inverse relationship
   <react-native-inverse-relationship>` collections, you may not add
   or remove objects from such a collection directly.
   Therefore, the type of such a one-to-many relationship
   property is actually a results collection, not a list.

Summary
-------

- A {+service-short+} **collection** is a homogenous container of zero
  or more instances of one
  :ref:`{+service-short+} type <react-native-realm-objects>`.

- Collections are :ref:`live <react-native-live-object>`, i.e. auto-updating, unless
  they are a snapshot or they are not part of a {+realm+}.

- Lazy evaluation of results collections means there is no need to
  design a special query to get limited or paginated results. Perform
  the query and read from the results collection as needed.

- There are two main kinds of collection: **lists** and **results**.
  Lists define the :ref:`to-many relationships <react-native-to-many-relationship>`
  of your {+service-short+} types, while results represent the
  lazily-loaded output of a :ref:`read operation <react-native-realm-database-reads>`.

Overview
--------
If you have an existing app built with the Stitch SDKs, you should migrate your 
app to use the new Realm SDKs. While much of the logic and flow of information 
is similar, there are a few important changes in the way your app connects to 
the {+realm+} backend.

What's Changed?
---------------
This section provides an overview of the main changes. Below, you will find 
language-specific guidance for migrating your app.

Services
~~~~~~~~
The {+realm+} SDKs do not provide hooks for calling Services (like the Twilio and 
AWS). We recommend using the AWS and/or Twilio ``npm`` packages within {+realm+} 
functions to connect to these services moving forward. For more information, 
see :doc:`<functions/upload-external-dependencies/>`

Functions
~~~~~~~~~
Your app can still call server-side functions, but they are now called from the 
``Realm.User`` object instead of the ``App`` object. 

Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Authentication methods are now called via Realm Credentials, and user logout now 
occurs on the ``Realm.User`` object rather than the ``App`` object.


Updating Your Existing Application
----------------------------------
The changes in the {+realm+} SDKs are best described by how they have been 
implemented in each language. Select the tab for the language you are using to 
see specific details about migrating your existing Stitch app to the Realm SDKs.

.. note:: 

   If you are developing apps in  C# or ObjectiveC, there is no migration guidance, 
   since we did not provide Stitch SDKs for those languages. To get started with 
   these languages, refer to the SDK documentation sections above.

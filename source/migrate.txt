Overview
--------
If you have an existing app built with the Stitch SDKs, you should migrate your 
app to use the new Realm SDKs. While much of the logic and flow of information 
hasn't changed, there are a few important changes in the way your app connects to 
the {+realm+} backend.

Updating Your Existing Application
----------------------------------
The changes in the {+realm+} SDKs are best described by how they have been 
implemented in each language. Select the tab for the language you are using to 
see specific details about migrating your existing Stitch app to the Realm SDKs.

.. note:: 

   If you are developing apps in  C# or Objective-C, there is no migration guidance, 
   since we did not provide Stitch SDKs for those languages. To get started with 
   these languages, refer to the SDK documentation sections above.

      and the Realm Android SDK, see the Android SDK documentation on

{+service-short+} Triggers execute application and database logic. Triggers 
can respond to events or use pre-defined schedules. 

Triggers listen for events of a configured type. Each Trigger links to a 
specific :doc:`{+service-short+} Function </functions>`.
When a Trigger observes an event that matches your
configuration, it *"fires."* The Trigger passes this event object as the 
argument to its linked Function. 

A Trigger might fire on:

- A specific *operation type* in a given Collection.
- An authentication event, such as user creation or deletion.
- A scheduled time.

{+service-short+} keeps track of the latest execution time for each
Trigger.

.. _trigger-types:

Trigger Types
-------------

{+service+} supports three types of triggers:

- :doc:`Database triggers </triggers/database-triggers>`
  respond to document insert, changes, or deletion. You can configure 
  Database Triggers for each linked MongoDB collection.

- :doc:`Authentication triggers </triggers/authentication-triggers>`
  respond to user creation, login, or deletion.

- :doc:`Scheduled triggers </triggers/scheduled-triggers>`
  execute functions according to a pre-defined schedule.

.. _trigger-limitations:

Limitations
-----------

Realm Function Constraints Apply
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Triggers invoke {+service-short+} Functions. This means they have the same 
constraints as all {+service-short+} Functions. 

:ref:`Learn more about {+service-short+} Function constraints.<function-constraints>`

Maximum Executions Per Second
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+service+} limits the execution of Trigger
Functions. A Trigger can execute up to 2500 times per second. When a 
Trigger calls a Function, this call goes into a queue. When capacity 
becomes available, {+service-short+} executes the Function call.

.. note::

   Your application's execution rate may be lower than 2500 per second. This 
   varies depending on your {+atlas-short+} instance size.

Database Triggers with *event ordering* work differently. Each ordered 
Trigger processes events in sequence. {+service-short+} waits for each event 
execution in the sequence to complete. Then, it handles the next event. Only 
one sequence for a given ordered Trigger executes at a time.

Number of Triggers Cannot Exceed Available Change Streams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+service+} limits the total number of Database Triggers. The size of your 
{+atlas-short+} cluster drives this limit. 

Each {+atlas-short+} cluster tier has a maximum number of supported change 
streams. A Database Trigger requires its own change stream. Other {+service-short+} 
services also use change streams, such as {+sync+}. Database Triggers 
may not exceed the number of available change streams.

tiers. <mongodb-service-limitations-change-streams>`

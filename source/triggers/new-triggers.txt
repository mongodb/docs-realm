Overview
--------

New Triggers allow you to execute server-side logic on a :doc:`regular schedule
that you define </triggers/cron-expressions>`. You can use scheduled Triggers to
do work that happens on a periodic basis, such as updating a document every
minute, generating a nightly report, or sending an automated weekly email
newsletter.

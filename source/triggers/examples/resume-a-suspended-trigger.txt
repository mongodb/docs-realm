Resume a Suspended Trigger
==========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Triggers may enter a :ref:`suspended <suspended_triggers>` state in
response to an event that prevents the Trigger's change stream from
continuing, such as a network disruption or change to the underlying
cluster. When a Trigger enters a suspended state, it does not receive
change events and will not fire.

.. note:: 

   In the event of a suspended or failed trigger, {+service-short+} sends the 
   project owner an email alerting them of the issue. 

You can attempt to restart a suspended Trigger from the {+ui+} or by
importing an application directory with {+cli-bin+}.

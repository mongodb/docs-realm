Disable a Trigger
=================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Triggers may enter a :guilabel:`suspended` state in response to
an event that prevents the Trigger's change stream from continuing, such
as a network disruption or change to the underlying cluster. When a
Trigger enters a suspended state, it does not receive change events and will not
fire.

.. note:: 

   In the event of a suspended or failed trigger, {+service-short+} sends the 
   project owner an email alerting them of the issue. 

You can suspend a Trigger from the {+ui+} or by
importing an application directory with {+cli-bin+}.

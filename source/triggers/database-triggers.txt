Overview
--------

Database Triggers allow you to execute server-side logic whenever a
document is added, updated, or removed in a
:term:`linked {+atlas+} cluster <linked cluster>`.
You can use database Triggers to implement complex data interactions,
including updating information in one document when a related document
changes or interacting with a :doc:`service </services>` upon the insertion
of a new document.

Database Triggers use MongoDB :manual:`change streams </changeStreams>`
to listen for changes to documents in a collection and pass
:ref:`database events <database-events>` to their associated Trigger
function.

.. important:: Change Stream Limitations
   
   {+backend+} opens a single change stream for each collection with at least
   one enabled Trigger and limits the total number of open change
   streams on each linked cluster across all {+app+}s based on the
   cluster's size. See :ref:`change stream limitations
   <mongodb-service-limitations-change-streams>` for more information.

.. note::

   Database Triggers are only available for `{+atlas+} <https://www.mongodb.com/realm?tck=docs_realm#atlas-form-container>`_ 
   clusters that are running MongoDB version 3.6 or newer.

Example
-------

An online store wants to notify its customers whenever one of their
orders changes location. They record each order in the ``store.orders``
collection as a document that resembles the following:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     _id: ObjectId("59cf1860a95168b8f685e378"),
     customerId: ObjectId("59cf17e1a95168b8f685e377"),
     orderDate: ISODate("2018-06-26T16:20:42.313Z"),
     shipDate: ISODate("2018-06-27T08:20:23.311Z"),
     orderContents: [
       { qty: 1, name: "Earl Grey Tea Bags - 100ct", price: NumberDecimal("10.99") }
     ],
     shippingLocation: [
       { location: "Memphis", time: ISODate("2018-06-27T18:22:33.243Z") },
     ]
   }

To automate this process, the store creates a database Trigger that
listens for ``UPDATE`` change events in the ``store.orders`` collection.
When the trigger observes an ``UPDATE`` event, it passes the
:ref:`change event object <database-events>` to its associated Function,
``textShippingUpdate``. The Function checks the change event for any
changes to the ``shippingLocation`` field and, if it was updated, sends
a text message to the customer with the new location of the order.

.. _database-triggers-configuration:

Configuration
-------------

Database Triggers have the following configuration options:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 30

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - :guilabel:`Trigger Type`

     - Required. The type of the Trigger. Set this value to ``DATABASE`` for database Triggers

   * - :guilabel:`Trigger Name`

     - Required. The name of the Trigger.

   * - :guilabel:`Linked Function`

     - Required. The name of the {+service-short+} Function that the Trigger
       executes whenever it fires. The Trigger passes the
       :ref:`database event object <database-events>` that
       caused it to fire as the only argument to this Function.

   * - :guilabel:`Cluster`

     - Required. The name of the MongoDB Service that the Trigger is
       associated with.

   * - :guilabel:`Database Name`

     - Required. The MongoDB database that contains the watched
       collection.

   * - :guilabel:`Collection Name`

     - Required. The name of the collection that the Trigger watches for
       change events.

   * - :guilabel:`Operation Types`

     - Required. A list of one or more :ref:`database operation
       types <database-event-operation-types>` that cause the Trigger to
       fire. Format each operation type as an uppercase string, e.g.,
       ``"INSERT"``.

       .. warning::

          Update operations executed from {+compass+} or the {+atlas+}
          Data Explorer fully replace the previous document. As a result,
          update operations from these clients will generate ``REPLACE``
          change events rather than ``UPDATE`` events.

   * - :guilabel:`Full Document`

     - If enabled, ``UPDATE`` change events include the latest
       :manual:`majority-committed </reference/read-concern-majority/>`
       version of the modified document *after* the change was applied in
       the ``fullDocument`` field.

       .. note::

          Regardless of this setting:
          
          - ``INSERT`` and ``REPLACE`` events always include the
            ``fullDocument`` field.
          
          - ``DELETE`` events never include the ``fullDocument`` field.

   * - :guilabel:`Document Preimage`

     - If enabled, change events include a copy of the modified document
       from immediately *before* the change was applied in the
       ``fullDocumentBeforeChange`` field. All change events except for
       ``INSERT`` events include the document preimage.
       
       .. important:: Collection-Level Preimage Settings
          
          Document preimages use extra information stored in the oplog.
          The extra data may have performance implications for some apps.
          
          Once you've enabled document preimages for any trigger on a
          given collection, that collection will include preimage data in
          the oplog and other triggers on the collection can use preimages
          with no additonal overhead.
          
          You can disable document preimages on a per-trigger basis to
          exclude the preimage from change events. Regardless of your
          trigger-level settings, a collection's oplog entries will
          continue to include preimage data unless you explicitly disable
          preimages for the collection.
          
          For more information, see :ref:`trigger-preimages`.

.. _database-events:

Database Change Events
----------------------

.. _database-event-operation-types:

Database change events represent individual changes in a specific
collection of your linked {+atlas+} cluster.

Every database event has the same operation type and structure as the
:manual:`change event </reference/change-events/>` object that was
emitted by the underlying change stream. Change events have the
following operation types:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 30

   * - Operation Type
     - Description

   * - ``INSERT``
     - Represents a new document added to the collection.

   * - ``UPDATE``
     - Represents a change to an existing document in the collection.

   * - ``REPLACE``
     - Represents a new document that replaced a document in the collection.

   * - ``DELETE``
     - Represents a document deleted from the collection.

Database change event objects have the following general form:

.. code-block:: json

   {
      _id : <ObjectId>,
      "operationType": <string>,
      "fullDocument": <document>,
      "fullDocumentBeforeChange": <document>,
      "ns": {
         "db" : <string>,
         "coll" : <string>
      },
      "documentKey": {
        "_id": <ObjectId>
      },
      "updateDescription": <document>,
      "clusterTime": <Timestamp>
   }

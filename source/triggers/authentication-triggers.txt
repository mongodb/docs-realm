Overview
--------

Authentication Triggers allow you to execute server-side logic
whenever a user interacts with an :doc:`authentication provider
</authentication/providers>`. You can use authentication Triggers
to implement advanced user management, including storing new user data
in your :term:`linked cluster`, maintaining data integrity upon user
deletion, or calling a service with a user’s information when they log
in.

Create an Authentication Trigger
--------------------------------

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui
      
      To create an authentication trigger in the {+ui+}:
      
      1. Click :guilabel:`Triggers` under :guilabel:`MongoDB
         Cluster` in the {+leftnav+}.
      
      2. Select the :guilabel:`Authentication Triggers` tab.
      
      3. Click :guilabel:`Add Authentication Trigger` in the top
         right to open the trigger configuration page.
      
      4. Enter :ref:`configuration values <auth-trigger-configuration>`
         for the trigger and click :guilabel:`Save` at the bottom of
         the page.

         :lightbox:
      
   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli

      To create an authentication Trigger with :doc:`{+cli+}
      </deploy/realm-cli-reference>`:
      
      1. Add an authentication Trigger :ref:`configuration file
         <auth-trigger-configuration>` to the ``triggers``
         subdirectory of a local application directory.
      
         .. note::
            
            {+backend+} does not enforce specific filenames for {+service-short+} Trigger
            configuration files. However, once imported, {+backend+} will
            rename each configuration file to match the name of the
            Trigger it defines, e.g. ``mytrigger.json``.
      
      2. :doc:`Import </deploy/deploy-cli>` the
         application directory into your application.
      
         .. code-block:: shell

Authentication Trigger Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::

   tabs:
     - id: cli
       content: |
         Configuration files for authentication Triggers have the
         following form:

         .. cssclass:: wide-container
         .. code-block:: none
            :caption: ``/triggers/<trigger name>.json``

            {
               "type": <string>,
               "name": <string>,
               "function_name": <string>,
               "config": {
                 "operation_type": <string>,
                 "providers": [<string>, ...]
               },
               "disabled": <boolean>
            }

     - id: ui
       content: |
         Authentication Triggers have the following configuration
         parameters:

.. cssclass:: auth-table
.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 30

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - | :guilabel:`Trigger Type`
       | *type*

     - Required. The type of the trigger. For authentication Triggers,
       this value should be set to ``AUTHENTICATION``.

   * - | :guilabel:`Trigger Name`
       | *name*

     - Required. The name of the trigger.

   * - | :guilabel:`Linked Function`
       | *function_name*

     - Required. The name of the {+service-short+} Function that the Trigger
       executes whenever it fires. The Trigger passes the
       :ref:`authentication event object <authentication-events>` that
       caused it to fire as the only argument to this function.

   * - | :guilabel:`Operation Type`
       | *config.operation_type*

     - Required. The :ref:`authentication operation
       type <authentication-event-operation-types>` that causes the
       trigger to fire. The operation type must be formatted as a
       fully-capitalized string, e.g. ``"LOGIN"``.

   * - | :guilabel:`Providers`
       | *config.providers*

     - Required. A list of one or more :doc:`authentication provider
       </authentication/providers>` types. The Trigger will
       only listen for :ref:`authentication events
       <authentication-events>` produced by these providers.

       The following values are valid:

       .. include:: /includes/auth-provider-internal-names.rst

.. _authentication-events:

Authentication Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _authentication-event-operation-types:

Authentication events represent user interactions with an authentication
provider. Each event corresponds to a single user action with one of the
following operation types:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 30

   * - Operation Type
     - Description

   * - ``LOGIN``
     - Represents a single instance of a user logging in.

   * - ``CREATE``
     - Represents the creation of a new user.

   * - ``DELETE``
     - Represents the deletion of a user.

Authentication event objects have the following form:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   {
     "operationType": <string>,
     "providers": <array of strings>,
     "user": <user object>,
     "time": <ISODate>
   }

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 30

   * - Field
     - Description
   * - ``operationType``
     - The :ref:`operation type <authentication-event-operation-types>`
       of the authentication event.
   * - ``providers``
     - The :doc:`authentication providers </authentication/providers>`
       that emitted the event.

       One of the following names represents each authentication provider:

       .. include:: /includes/auth-provider-internal-names.rst

       .. note::

          Generally, only one authentication provider emits each event.
          When a you delete a user linked to
          multiple providers, the ``DELETE`` event for
          that user includes all linked providers. 
   * - ``user``
     - The :doc:`user object </authentication>` of the user that interacted with
       the authentication provider.
   * - ``time``
     - The time at which the event occurred.

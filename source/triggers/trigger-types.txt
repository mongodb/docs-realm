{+service-short+} Triggers enable you to execute application and database
logic automatically, either in response to events or based on a
pre-defined schedule. {+service+} supports three types of triggers:

- :doc:`Database triggers </triggers/database-triggers>`, which can
  automatically respond upon any document insertion, alteration, or
  removal in a linked MongoDB collection.

- :doc:`Authentication triggers </triggers/authentication-triggers>`,
  which execute additional server-side logic upon user creation,
  authentication, or deletion.

- :doc:`Scheduled triggers </triggers/scheduled-triggers>`, which
  execute functions at regular intervals according to a pre-defined
  schedule.

Triggers listen for application events of a configured type
and are each linked with a specific :doc:`{+service-short+} Function </functions>`.
Whenever a Trigger observes an event that matches your
configuration, it *"fires"* and passes the event object that caused it
to fire as the argument to its linked Function. You can
configure the events that cause a Trigger to fire based on
their *operation type* as well as other values specific to each type of
Trigger.

.. note::

   {+service+} limits the execution of Trigger
   Functions to a rate of 1000 executions per second per Trigger. If there 
   are additional Trigger executions beyond this threshold, {+backend+} adds 
   their associated Function calls to a queue and executes each one when the 
   capacity becomes available.

   Database Triggers with *event ordering* enabled are an exception to
   this rule. Each ordered Trigger processes events in order,
   waiting for the previous event execution to complete before handling
   the next event. Therefore, only one execution of a particular ordered
   Trigger executes at any given time.

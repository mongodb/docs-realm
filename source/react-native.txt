MongoDB Realm React Native SDK
==============================

The {+service+} React Native SDK enables client applications using the
`React Native <https://facebook.github.io/react-native/>`__ framework for
iOS and Android to access data stored in local {+realms+} and interact
with backend services like Functions, MongoDB Data Access, and
authentication. React Native enables you to build cross-platform iOS and
Android apps with a single codebase using the `React
<https://reactjs.org/>`__ framework. The React Native SDK supports both
JavaScript and `TypeScript <https://www.typescriptlang.org/>`__
applications.

.. note::

   The React Native SDK does not support JavaScript or TypeScript
   applications written for web browsers. For that use case, you should
   consider the :ref:`Web SDK <web-intro>`. For development on Node.js
   without React, refer to the :ref:`Node.js SDK <node-intro>`
   documentation.

Installation
------------

To learn how to add the {+service+} React Native SDK library as a dependency
to your application, see
:ref:`Install Realm for React Native <react-native-install>`.

Get Started
-----------

To get started quickly with some JavaScript or TypeScript code, see the :ref:`Quick Start
<react-native-client-quick-start>`.


The Realm Data Model
--------------------

You can store a wide variety of data within {+realms+} stored on your
device. With :term:`{+sync+}`, you can share updates to that data across
client devices and {+atlas+}.

For information about the structure of data you can store in {+realms+},
see :ref:`Realms <react-native-realms>`, :ref:`Objects
<react-native-realm-objects>`, and :ref:`Relationships
<react-native-client-relationships>`.

To learn about the results returned from {+realm+} queries, see
:ref:`Collections <react-native-client-collections>`.

Work with Realm Database
------------------------

Once you have defined a data model for your application, you
need to be able to :ref:`write <react-native-realm-database-writes>` and
:ref:`read <react-native-realm-database-reads>` pieces of data to and
from your {+realm+}s.

To learn how to query for data in local {+realms+}, see
:ref:`Query Engine <react-native-client-query-engine>`.

For information about how to react to changes in {+realm+} data, see
:ref:`Notifications <react-native-client-notifications>`.

For additional security, you can also :ref:`encrypt a {+realm+}
<react-native-encrypt-a-realm>`.

Work with MongoDB Realm
-----------------------

The React Native SDK also connects your {+service-short+} client
application with your {+app+}'s backend services, including Functions,
Services, Webhooks, {+sync+}, and built-in third-party authentication.

To get connected to your {+backend+} app, see
:ref:`Initialize the RealmAppClient <react-native-init-appclient>`.

To learn how to connect to a {+backend+} app to call
Functions, query data in an instance of {+atlas+}, and synchronize data
in {+realms+}, see :ref:`Call a Function <react-native-call-a-function>`.

To learn how to handle schema updates in your client application, see
:ref:`Migrations <react-native-client-migrations>`.

To learn how to query for data in MongoDB with the React Native SDK, see :ref:`
MongoDB Data Access <react-native-mongodb-data-access>`.

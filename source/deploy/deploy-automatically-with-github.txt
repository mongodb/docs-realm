Overview
--------

You can configure a Realm app to automatically deploy whenever you push updated
:ref:`configuration files <config-files>` to a :github:`GitHub <>` repository.
You can clone the GitHub repository to your computer and then use standard Git
commands to pull down the latest versions and deploy new changes.

Prerequisites
-------------

- A :github:`GitHub <>` account and repository. The repository should
  either contain an :ref:`application directory <app-directory>` or be
  empty. For information on how to create an empty repository, see
  GitHub's `create a repo
  <https://help.github.com/en/articles/create-a-repo>`_ guide.

- An installed copy of the Git CLI. If you do not have ``git``
  installed, see the official guide for `Installing Git
  <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>`_.

- A `{+atlas+} <https://www.mongodb.com/realm?tck=docs_realm#atlas-form-container>`_ 
  :atlas:`Programmatic API Key </configure-api-access/#programmatic-api-keys>` 
  to authenticate and authorize access to your app's underlying Git
  repo. If you have not yet generated a programmatic API key for your
  Atlas organization, do so now.

Enable Automatic Deployment with GitHub
---------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/steps/github-deploy.rst

.. _deploy-github-rollback-to-prior-deploy:

Rollback to a Previous Deploy
-----------------------------

When you view your deployment history, you'll see the 25 most recent 
deployments. You can use the :guilabel:`Re-Deploy` button to roll back
to one of the last 25 deploys.

.. _deploy-github-make-changes-ui:

Make Changes from the UI
------------------------

Enabling automatic GitHub deployment does not prevent you from making changes
to your {+app+} from the {+service-short+} UI. You can make changes to your 
app via the UI, and those changes are automatically committed back to your 
linked GitHub repository.

.. tip::

   If your linked GitHub repository contains new commits that are not reflected
   in your {+service+} UI changes, {+service-short+} can't automatically 
   commit those changes to your repo. However, you can use the 
   :guilabel:`Export` button to download the updated configuration files 
   to your local machine, and then you push them manually to your GitHub 
   repository.

When changes are committed to your linked GitHub repository, you'll see a
:guilabel:`Commit: <commit-hash>` link in your app's Deployment History.

You can click that link to view the commit in GitHub. The ``mongodb-realm`` 
bot appears as the commit author.

.. _deploy-github-make-changes-cli:

Avoid Making Changes from the CLI
---------------------------------

With automatic GitHub deployment enabled, avoid making changes to your app 
using ``realm-cli push``. Pushing new configuration files via the CLI does not 
kick off an update to the linked GitHub repository. This means that 
contributors to your GitHub repository have stale configuration files. 
When the the next commit to the linked repository triggers an automatic 
deploy, changes that you made via the CLI could be reverted or overwritten 
with stale configuration files.

Summary
-------

- You can deploy your {+app+} by modifying a repo hosted on GitHub.

- When Automatic GitHub Deployment is enabled, {+service+} immediately
  deploys the latest commit. To deploy, commit your changes locally, then push
  them to your repo on GitHub.

- {+service+} keeps track of your :ref:`Deployment History
  <deployment-history>`. You can roll back to the last 25 deployments.

- When you make changes via the {+service-short+} UI after enabling Automatic 
  GitHub Deployment, those changes are automatically committed back to your 
  linked repository.

- Do not use ``realm-cli push`` to update configuration files after enabling 
  Automatic GitHub Deployment.

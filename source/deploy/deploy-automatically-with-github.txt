Overview
--------

You can configure a Realm app to automatically deploy whenever you push updated
:ref:`configuration files <config-files>` to a :github:`GitHub <>` repository.
You can clone the GitHub repository to your computer and then use standard Git
commands to pull down the latest versions and deploy new changes.

Prerequisites
-------------

- A :github:`GitHub <>` account and repository. The repository should
  either contain an :ref:`application directory <app-directory>` or be
  empty. For information on how to create an empty repository, see
  GitHub's `create a repo
  <https://help.github.com/en/articles/create-a-repo>`_ guide.

- An installed copy of the Git CLI. If you do not have ``git``
  installed, see the official guide for `Installing Git
  <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>`_.

- A `{+atlas+} <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?tck=docs_realm>`_ 
  :atlas:`Programmatic API Key </configure-api-access/#programmatic-api-keys>` 
  to authenticate and authorize access to your app's underlying Git
  repo. If you have not yet generated a programmatic API key for your
  Atlas organization, do so now.

Procedure
---------

.. include:: /includes/steps/github-deploy.rst

Summary
-------

- You can deploy your {+app+} by modifying a repo
  hosted on GitHub.

- When Automatic GitHub Deployment is enabled, {+service+} immediately
  deploys the latest commit. To deploy, commit your changes locally, then push
  them to your repo on GitHub.

- {+service+} keeps track of your :ref:`Deployment History
  <deployment-history>`.

Overview
--------

When you make changes to your application through the {+ui+}, those
changes are saved in a draft state. Draft changes do not affect your
production application and are invisible to end users. This is
particularly useful in situations where you need to make related changes
to multiple components in your application and want to avoid bugs and a
loss of functionality during the transition. When you want to publish
your changes, you can manually deploy them through the {+ui+}.

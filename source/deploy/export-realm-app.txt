As you develop a Realm app, you might want to share the
codebase with team members, make a backup, or work with a
version control system like Git. Realm's export
functionality makes this possible.

You can export Realm applications to a local application
directory from the Realm UI or with the ``realm-cli``
:ref:`export <realm-cli-export>` command.

Exported application directories use the same name as the Realm
application by default. Every configuration file must conform to its
:doc:`configuration file schema
</deploy/application-configuration-files>`.

Procedure
---------

Export from the Realm UI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The simplest way to export a Realm application is directly from the
Realm UI. To do so, click :guilabel:`Deploy` in the left-hand
navigation, select the :guilabel:`Import/Export App` tab, and then click
the :guilabel:`Export App` button.

Export with ``realm-cli``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Realm applications can be exported programmatically via the
:doc:`Command Line Interface </deploy/realm-cli-reference>`
(``realm-cli``).

Before beginning, ensure that you have properly :ref:`installed
<install-realm-cli>` ``realm-cli``.

Output
------

Your application will be exported to a local application directory. If
you did not specify a path for the directory with ``--output``, it will
be exported with the same name as the application into the current
working directory.

Only entities that are configured in your application will appear in
your exported application directory. See :doc:`Application Configuration
Files </deploy/application-configuration-files>` for more information on
the schema and contents of Realm applications.

Summary
-------

- You can use Realm's export functionality to share your codebase, make a backup, or work with a version control system.
- You can export Realm applications with the Realm UI or with the ``realm-cli`` :ref:`export <realm-cli-export>` command.

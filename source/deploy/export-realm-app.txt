As you develop a :term:`{+app+}`, you might want to share the
codebase with team members, make a backup, or work with a
version control system like Git. {+service+}'s export
functionality makes this possible.

You can export {+app+}s to a local application
directory from the {+ui+} or with the {+cli-bin+}
:ref:`export <realm-cli-export>` command.

Exported application directories use the same name as the {+app+}
by default. Every configuration file must conform to its
:ref:`configuration file schema <app-configuration>`.

Procedure
---------

Export from the Realm UI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The simplest way to export a {+app+} is directly from the
{+ui+}. To do so, click :guilabel:`Deploy` in the left-hand
navigation, select the :guilabel:`Import/Export App` tab, and then click
the :guilabel:`Export App` button.

Export with {+cli-bin+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+app+}s can be exported programmatically via the :doc:`Command Line Interface
</deploy/realm-cli-reference>` ({+cli-bin+}).

.. tip::
   
   Ensure that you :ref:`installed <install-realm-cli>` {+cli-bin+} and logged
   in with a valid API key.

You can export an application's configuration directory by specifying its remote
App ID and an optional local path. If you do not specify a local path, the
command outputs the configuration directory in the current working directory.

.. code-block:: shell

   realm-cli pull --remote=<App ID> --local=<Output Directory Path>

.. warning::

   The directory specified by ``--output`` must not already exist, otherwise
   {+cli-bin+} throws an error and does not pull the configuration files.

Output
------

Your application will be exported to a local application directory. If
you did not specify a path for the directory with ``--output``, it will
be exported with the same name as the application into the current
working directory.

Only entities that are configured in your application will appear in your
exported application directory. See :ref:`app-configuration` for more
information on configuration files.

Summary
-------

- You can use {+service-short+}'s export functionality to share your codebase, make a backup, or work with a version control system.
- You can export {+app+}s with the {+ui+} or with the {+cli-bin+} :ref:`export <realm-cli-export>` command.

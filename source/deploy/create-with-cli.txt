{+service+} applications can be created and initialized with the
{+cli-bin+} :ref:`import <realm-cli-import>` command.

Create a new {+app+} by running :ref:`import
<realm-cli-import>` from an application directory that cannot be linked
to an existing application by Application ID.

Prerequisites
-------------

- A :ref:`properly installed <install-realm-cli>` copy of
  {+cli-bin+} that has been added to your system ``PATH``.

- | The :guilabel:`Project ID` or :guilabel:`Project Name` of the
    :ref:`MongoDB Atlas project <projects>` that will host your {+service-short+}
    application.
  | You can find both of these values in your `Atlas project settings
    <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/tutorial/manage-project-settings/>`_.

- A `{+atlas+} <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?tck=docs_realm>`_ :atlas:`programmatic API key </configure-api-access/#programmatic-api-keys>` for the MongoDB Cloud
  account you wish to log in with.

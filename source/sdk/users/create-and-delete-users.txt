Atlas Device SDK provides built-in functionality to manage application users,
both on the device and in Atlas. Your application can take advantage of
role-based data access rules to determine the read and write permissions of a
given user. When combined with Sync subscription queries, these features
determine what data a user can :ref:`read and write from a synced database 
<sdks-write-synced-database>`.

You can also associate :ref:`metadata <sdks-user-metadata>` or 
:ref:`custom data <sdks-custom-user-data>` with user accounts.

Users can have multiple identities. For more information, refer to
:ref:`sdks-link-user-identities`.

Your app can manage multiple users on a device. For more information, refer
to :ref:`sdks-multi-user-applications`.

For more information about authentication providers, identities, and user
sessions, refer to :ref:`Authenticate & Manage Users <users-and-authentication>`
in the App Services documentation.

.. tip:: Atlas Device SDK Users Differ from Other Types of Atlas Users

   Atlas Device SDK users are distinct from :ref:`database users <mongodb-users>`
   or :ref:`Atlas account users <atlas_users>`. SDK users are bounded by the
   App Services App where they are registered, and only have access to
   resources you provide through the App. Your application can let SDK users:

   - :ref:`Read and write from a synced database <sdks-write-synced-database>`
   - :ref:`Call an Atlas Function <sdks-call-function>`
   - Call :ref:`Data API <data-api>` or :ref:`custom HTTPS endpoints <custom-endpoints>`
   - Read and write from specified collections and databases in MongoDB Atlas
     through :ref:`the MongoClient API <sdks-access-mongodb>`

   SDK users do not have direct Atlas database access, or direct Atlas account
   access. It is your responsibility to manage these application users,
   including complying with data retention or deletion policies and regulatory
   requirements where you publish your applications.

.. _sdks-create-users:

Create Users
------------

For most :ref:`authentication methods <authentication-providers>`, Atlas App Services 
automatically creates a :ref:`user object <user-objects>` the first time 
a user authenticates. The only exception is email/password authentication. 
When you use email/password authentication, you must :ref:`register 
<sdks-email-password-user-register>` and :ref:`confirm 
<sdks-email-password-user-confirm>` a user before the user can 
authenticate to an App Services App.

Automatically Create Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you authenticate a user with one of the following authentication
providers, this automatically creates a user object for the user:

- Anonymous authentication
- OAuth 2.0 through Facebook, Google, and Apple ID
- Custom JWT
- Custom Function

If your app uses email/password authentication, you must manually create
users either in the client code or in Atlas.

If you are adding a secondary authentication method, such as adding a
OAuth credential for a user created through anonymous authentication,
you may want to link user identities instead of creating a new user. For
more details about how to link these identities, refer to
:ref:`sdks-link-user-identities`.

Manually Create Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your app uses email/password authentication, you must manually register a
user to create a user object. For more information about registering
email/password users, refer to :ref:`sdks-email-password-user-register`.

You can also manually create email/password users through App Services. For
more information about manually creating users through the UI, App Services
Admin API, or App Services CLI, refer to :ref:`create-email-password-user` in
the App Services documentation.

Account Deletion Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you distribute your application through some app stores or in some
regions, an app that requires users to create an account also requires
you to give users the option to delete their account and any associated user
data or metadata. The SDK provides a method you can call from the client code
to comply with these deletion requirements. However, this method only deletes
the user account; it does not delete any associated user data or metadata.

Following is a resource that provides some details about these account deletion
requirements for distribution through the Apple and Google app stores. This
is not intended to be a comprehensive list of resources related to account
deletion requirements. Consult your distribution agreements and any relevant
regulations in the regions where you plan to distribute your application to
ensure you comply with all applicable account and data deletion policies.

   .. tab:: Apple App Store Requirements
      :tabid: apple

      Apple :apple:`requires that applications listed through its App Store 
      <app-store/review/guidelines/#5.1.1>` must give any user who creates 
      an account the option to delete the account. Whether you use an 
      authentication method where you must manually register a user, such as 
      email/password authentication, or one that that automatically creates a 
      user, such as Sign-In with Apple, you must implement user account deletion.

   .. tab:: Google Play Store Requirements
      :tabid: google

      Google requires that applications listed through its Google Play store 
      must give any user who creates an account `an in-app path to delete the
      account and its associated data 
      <https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/13327111>`__. 
      Whether you use an authentication method where you must manually register a
      user, such as email/password authentication, or one that that automatically
      creates a user, such as Sign-In with Google, you must implement user account 
      deletion.

.. _sdks-delete-users:

Delete Users from Atlas
-----------------------

The SDK provides a method you can call from an application to delete the
user object. This sends a request to Atlas to delete the user from the
server.

.. important::

   Deleting a user only deletes the user object, which may contain associated 
   :ref:`metadata <sdks-user-metadata>`. This does not delete :ref:`custom 
   user data <sdks-custom-user-data>` or user-entered data from your 
   application. If you collect additional user data, you must implement your
   own methods or processes to delete that data.

   You can use the :ref:`Authentication Trigger DELETE event
   <authentication-event-operation-types>` to programmatically clean up other
   data when you delete a user. For example, you can delete the user's data
   from your custom user data collection or another service.

Calling the user delete method performs the following:

- Deletes synced databases associated with the user from the device.
- deletes the ``User`` object from the Atlas App Services server
- Sets the user state on the device to removed.

Because this method deletes any synced databases owned by the user, you 
should only call this method after closing the user's databases.

If the deleted user wants to use your app in the future, the user must 
sign up for a new account. They can use the same credentials 
(depending on the authentication provider), 
but the new account does not have the same user ID or links to custom user data
as their deleted account.

.. _sdks-remove-users:

Remove Users from Device
------------------------

In some cases, you may not want to delete a user entirely, but may want to
remove them from the device. In this scenario, users continue to exist in
Atlas. You may want to force users to re-authenticate under some circumstances,
such as when a paid subscription expires. Or you may want to temporarily
persist a user on the server to allow for account recovery.

Removing a user:

- *Does not* delete the ``User`` object from the Atlas App Services App.
- :ref:`Logs the user <sdks-logout>` out if they are logged in.
- Deletes synced databases associated with the user from the device.
- Sets the user's state to removed.

Because removing a user deletes any synced databases owned by the user, you 
should only call this method after closing the user's databases.

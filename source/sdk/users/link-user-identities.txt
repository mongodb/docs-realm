Atlas Device SDK provides :ref:`many authentication providers
<authentication-providers>` to log users into your app. Each provider has its
own credentials that create a unique user identity. The SDK lets you merge
multiple identities into a single user account.

User identities must be linked prior to logging a user in. Once the user is
logged in, you cannot link the credential used to login to the user account. 
Also, you cannot link multiple email/password identities together.

Example
-------

Consider an application that offers :ref:`anonymous login
<anonymous-authentication>`, which allows users to explore the app without 
registering. If a user wants to continue using the application, they can
create a permanent account with an authentication provider intended to
persist user data over a longer period, such as email/password authentication.
The SDK creates a new identity belonging to a new ``User`` object. The app can
then link the new identity with the current user.

.. note:: 

   Depending on how you have configured email/password authentication, there may 
   be additional steps (confirming the email address, for example) before the 
   new account is created and can be linked.

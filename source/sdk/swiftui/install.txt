Overview
--------

{+service+}'s Swift SDK enables your iOS, macOS, tvOS,
and watchOS applications to interact with {+service+} using either
the Swift or Objective-C programming languages. This page
details how to install {+service-short+} in your project and get
started.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before getting started, ensure your development environment
meets the following prerequisites:

- `Xcode <https://developer.apple.com/xcode/>`__ version 12.4 or higher.
- Target of iOS 9.0 or higher, macOS 10.9 or higher, tvOS 9.0 or higher, or watchOS 2.0 or higher.
- If using Swift Package Manager, target of iOS 11+ or macOS 10.10+ is required.

.. important::

   There are special considerations when using {+client-database+} with
   tvOS. See :ref:`ios-tvos` for more information.

Installation
------------

You can use ``SwiftPM``, ``CocoaPods``, or ``Carthage`` to add the
{+service+} Swift SDK to your project.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: SwiftPM
      :tabid: swiftpm

      .. include:: /includes/steps/install-swiftpm.rst

   .. tab:: CocoaPods
      :tabid: cocoapods

      If you are installing with `CocoaPods <https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html>`__, you need CocoaPods 1.10.1 or later.

      .. include:: /includes/steps/install-cocoapods.rst

   .. tab:: Carthage
      :tabid: carthage

      If you are installing with `Carthage <https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#installing-carthage>`__, you need Carthage 0.33 or later.

      .. include:: /includes/steps/install-carthage.rst

   .. tab:: Static Framework
      :tabid: static-framework

      Installing the Realm Swift SDK as a static framework is only available
      for iOS targets.

      .. include:: /includes/steps/install-swift-static-framework.rst
       
      .. tip::
      
         If using the Realm Objective-C API within a Swift project, we 
         recommend you include both Realm Swift and Realm Objective-C in your 
         project. Within your Swift files, you can access the Swift API and 
         all required wrappers. Using the RealmSwift API in mixed 
         Swift/Objective-C projects is possible because the vast majority of 
         RealmSwift types are directly aliased from their Objective-C 
         counterparts.

Import Realm
------------

Add the following line at the top of your source files
to use {+service+}:

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/MyRealmApp.snippet.import-realm.m
         :language: objectivec

   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/RealmApp.snippet.import-realm.swift
         :language: swift

Troubleshooting
---------------

If you have build issues after using one of these methods to install 
{+service-short+}, see :ref:`our troubleshooting guidelines <ios-resolve-build-issues>` 
for information about resolving those issues {+realm+}.

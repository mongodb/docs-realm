The SwiftUI property wrappers help with this, but there may be times when 
devs want to use change notifications so this should also incorporate
an example of using change notifications + link to the Swift React to Changes page.
Maybe also an example of using ``@ObservedObject`` like how we observe the 
``RealmSwift.app`` to react to login state changes.

.. _swiftui-update-view-observed-collection:

Update the UI When an Object Changes
------------------------------------

The Swift SDK provides the :swift-sdk:`@ObservedRealmObject 
<Structs/ObservedRealmObject.html>` property wrapper that invalidates a view 
when an observed object changes. You can use this property wrapper to 
create a view that automatically updates itself when the observed object
changes, such as a new item being added to a group.

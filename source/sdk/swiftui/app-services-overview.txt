This is a net new page that contains content from Fundamentals/App Services 
+ Fundamentals/Realm Sync. It will likely be a direct duplicate of the version
that will live in the Swift docs, but this info should be available to users
IN these docs without having to cross-link out to somewhere else for 
discoverability

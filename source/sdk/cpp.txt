Use Atlas Device SDK for C++ to write applications that access data
stored locally on devices and sync data with Atlas.

.. kicker:: What You Can Do

Develop Apps with the SDK
-------------------------

Use the SDK's open-source database - Realm - as an object store on the device. 
Use Device Sync to keep data in sync with your MongoDB Atlas cluster and 
other clients.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Store Data with the SDK
      :tabid: device-persistence

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Install the C++ SDK

            Use Swift Package Manager or Cmake to :ref:`cpp-install` 
            in your project.

            Include the header in the translation unit where you want to 
            use it to get started.

         .. step:: Define an Object Schema

            Use C++ to idiomatically :ref:`define an object type
            <cpp-define-a-new-object-type>`.

         .. step:: Open a Database

            The SDK's database - Realm - stores objects in files on your device.
            :ref:`Configure and open a database <cpp-configure-and-open-a-realm>`
            to get started reading and writing data.

         .. step:: Read and Write Data

            :ref:`Create <cpp-crud-create>`, :ref:`read <cpp-crud-read>`,
            :ref:`update <cpp-crud-update>`, and :ref:`delete <cpp-crud-delete>`
            objects from the database. Filter data using the SDK's
            :ref:`query engine <cpp-filter-data>`.

         .. step:: React to Changes

            Live objects mean that your data is always up-to-date.
            You can :ref:`register a notification handler <cpp-react-to-changes>`
            to watch for changes and perform some logic, such as updating
            your UI.

   .. tab:: Sync Data Across Devices
      :tabid: device-sync

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Connect to an Atlas App Services App

            Configure :ref:`Device Sync in an App Services App
            <realm-sync-get-started>`. Define data access rules. Use
            Development Mode to infer your schema from your C++ data 
            model.

            Then, :ref:`connect to the backend <cpp-connect-to-backend>` from
            your client.

         .. step:: Authenticate a User

            Use one of our authentication providers to :ref:`authenticate a
            user <cpp-authenticate-users>`. App Services provides access
            to popular authentication providers, such as Apple, Google, or
            Facebook. Use our built-in email/password provider to manage
            users without a third-party, or use custom JWT authentication to
            integrate with other authentication providers. Anonymous authentication
            provides access without requiring a login or persisting user data.

         .. step:: Open a Synced Database

            :ref:`Configure and open a synced database <cpp-open-synced-realm>`.
            :ref:`Subscribe to a query <cpp-manage-flexible-sync-subscriptions>`
            to determine what data the synced database can read and write.

         .. step:: Read and Write Synced Data

            The APIs to read and write data are the same whether you're using 
            a synced or non-synced database. Data that you read and write to 
            the device is automatically kept in sync with your Atlas
            cluster and other clients. Apps keep working offline and
            deterministically sync changes whenever a network connection is
            available.

   .. tab:: Build with Atlas App Services
      :tabid: app-services

      .. container::

         Call Serverless Functions
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

         You can :ref:`call serverless Functions <cpp-call-a-function>`
         from your client application that run in an App Services backend.

         Authenticate Users
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

         Authenticate users with built-in and third-party :ref:`authentication
         providers <cpp-authenticate-users>`. Use the authenticated user to
         access App Services.

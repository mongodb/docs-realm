The Realm C++ SDK enables client applications written in C++ to access data
stored in realms and sync data with Atlas.

Limitations
-----------

The C++ SDK does not yet support all Realm database features or Atlas App
Services integrations.

Requirements
------------

- Minimum C++ standard: C++20.
- For development on macOS: Xcode 11.x or later.
- Otherwise, we recommend git and `CMake <https://cmake.org>`_.

Install
-------

With Swift Package Manager (SPM)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When developing with Xcode, you can use Swift Package Manager (SPM) to install realm-cpp:

- Create or load your project in Xcode.
- Open the :guilabel:`File` menu and select :guilabel:`Add Packages...`. This opens the SPM window.
- In the SPM window search bar, paste the repo URL: ``https://github.com/realm/realm-cpp``.
- Leave :guilabel:`Dependency Rule` as ``Branch``: ``main``.
- Select your project under :guilabel:`Add to Project`.
- Click :guilabel:`Add Package`. SPM will verify and download the realm-cpp
  package and its dependencies. Once downloaded, Xcode asks which package
  products in the package to add to which targets in your project. ``realm-cpp``
  currently only has one package product: ``realm-cpp-sdk``.
- Under :guilabel:`Package Product`, Ensure ``realm-cpp-sdk`` is checked.
- Under :guilabel:`Add to Target`, select the target you would like to add realm
  to. For example, the target might be the main executable of your app.
- Click :guilabel:`Add Package`.

This makes the ``cpprealm`` library headers available to 
your project and links the realm-cpp dependency to your build target.

With CMake
~~~~~~~~~~

Add the ``realm/realm-cpp`` repo as a git submodule and pull it and its dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

   # cd /path/to/projectrepo/
   git submodule add https://github.com/realm/realm-cpp.git
   git submodule update --init --recursive

This adds a ``realm-cpp`` subdirectory.

Create or modify your ``CMakeLists.txt`` in the root directory of your project.
Use ``add_subdirectory()`` to locate the Realm dependency and
``target_link_libraries()`` to link the Realm dependency to your target
executable. Set the minimum C++ standard to 20 with
``set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20)``.

.. code-block:: cmake
   :emphasize-lines: 6, 12, 13

   cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.15)

   project(MyRealmCppProject)

   # Minimum C++ standard
   set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20)

   # Create an executable target called myApp with the source file main.cpp
   # Specify the path to the realm subdirectory
   add_executable(myApp main.cpp)

   add_subdirectory(realm-cpp)
   target_link_libraries(myApp PRIVATE cpprealm)

Run CMake in a gitignored directory, such as ``build``, to generate the build
configurations that you can then use to compile your app:

.. code-block:: bash

   # build/ is in .gitignore
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake .. # Create Makefile by reading the CMakeLists.txt in the parent directory (../)
   make # Actually build the app

You can use CMake to generate more than simple Makefiles by using the ``-G``
flag. See the `CMake documentation <https://cmake.org/documentation/>`_ for more
information.

Usage
-----

Include the Header
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make the Realm C++ SDK available in your code by including the
``cpprealm/sdk.hpp`` header:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/examples.snippet.includes.cpp
   :language: cpp

Define Your Data Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can define your models as classes or structs that inherit from
``realm::object``: 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/examples.snippet.define-models.cpp
   :language: cpp

You must declare any property you want to store (persist) in a realm as
``realm::persisted``.

Your model must also expose a public type definition called ``schema``. Use the
``realm::schema`` and ``realm::property`` templates to describe your schema.

Realm ignores any members not declared as ``realm::persisted`` and not
declared in the schema.

Use Realm
~~~~~~~~~

You can use your data models as you would normal classes, except:

- You may not modify any properties outside of a write transaction.

A **realm** is a collection of persisted objects. When opening a realm, you must
specify which models are available by passing the models into the template
parameter list of the ``realm::open()`` function.

To open a write transaction, pass a function to ``realm.write()``. Make all
modifications within that function.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/examples.snippet.usage.cpp
   :language: cpp

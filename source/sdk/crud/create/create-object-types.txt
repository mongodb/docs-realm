This page describes how to create specific types of objects using Atlas Device
SDK. To learn more about object models and how to define them, refer to 
:ref:`sdks-object-models`.

You can create objects whose object type is managed by the database instance. 
For more information, refer to 
:ref:`sdks-configure-and-open-database` or 
:ref:`sdks-configure-and-open-synced-database`.

For more information about write transactions and the methods you can use to
create an object, refer to :ref:`sdks-crud-create`.

For information about creating specific property types, including special
types, collections, and relationship properties, refer to
:ref:`sdks-create-specific-property-types`.

Create Specific SDK Object Types
--------------------------------

Before you can create a new object and persist it to the database, you must 
:ref:`sdks-object-models`. Then, include that object type in your database
schema when you open the database.

.. important:: Object Types Must Be in Your Schema

   You can only write objects whose object type is included in the database
   schema. If you try to reference or write an object of an object type 
   that isn't in your schema, the SDK returns a schema validation error.

.. _sdks-create-realm-object:

Create a Realm Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The SDK refers to the base object type as a Realm object. This identifies it
as an object type that can be managed by the device persistence layer, Realm
database.

.. _sdks-create-an-embedded-object:

Create an Embedded Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a new embedded object instance, assign an instance of an 
:ref:`embedded object type <sdks-embedded-objects>` to a 
parent object's property. This can be in a one-to-one, one-to-many, or 
inverse :ref:`relationship <sdks-relationships>` 
depending on how you defined the embedded object within the parent 
object type.

.. note:: Embedded Objects Must Be Created Within a Parent Object

   An embedded object requires a parent object and *cannot* exist as an 
   independent SDK object. 

Embedded objects have strict ownership with their parent object.
After you create the embedded object, you *cannot* reassign it to a 
different parent object or share it between multiple parent objects.

.. _sdks-create-asymmetric-object:

Create an Asymmetric Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Asymmetric objects are write-only. Once inserted, the asymmetric object syncs
to Atlas. You *cannot* access the managed data locally, remove it from the 
database, or query for it. 

For information on how to use asymmetric objects in your application, 
refer to :ref:`sdks-stream-data-to-atlas`.

.. _sdks-create-geospatial-data:

Create a Geospatial Data Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After you :ref:`define a geospatial object type <sdks-define-geospatial-object>`,
you can use that type to create objects that persist geospatial data.

Initialize objects that use the geospatial data class, and add them to the
database like you would any other object type.

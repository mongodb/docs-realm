This page describes how to create specific property types, including:

- Special SDK-specific types, such as counters or mixed data types
- Collection property types, such as lists, sets, and maps
- Relationship property types, including to-one, to-many, and inverse
  relationships

To learn more about how to define these property types in the object model,
refer to :ref:`sdks-object-models`.

For information about how to create specific types of objects, refer to 
:ref:`sdks-create-specific-object-types`.

For information about write transactions and the methods you can use to create
objects, refer to :ref:`sdks-crud-create`.

.. _sdks-create-special-property-types:

Create Special Properties
-------------------------

Depending on how you define your object type, you might have properties 
that are special SDK-specific types. These may be custom data types, or
familiar language types that have specific requirements or limitations when
used with Atlas Device SDK.

.. _sdks-create-mixed-property-type:

Create a Generic (Mixed) Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The SDK provides a generic mixed property type that could contain a
number of property types. It's the closest analog to a polymorphic data type
that the SDK provides.

For a list of the value types that a mixed property can hold, refer to
:ref:`sdks-mixed-data-type`.

.. _sdks-create-collection-property-types:

Create Collection Properties
----------------------------

The SDK provides the following collection type properties:

- List
- Set
- Map

Collections are mutable within a write transaction.

.. tip:: Listen for Changes to a Created Collection
   
   After you create a collection, you can register a notification handler to 
   listen for changes. For more information, refer to  
   :ref:`<sdks-collection-change-listener>`.

.. _sdks-create-list-properties:

Create List Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The SDK's list data type is a container that holds a collection of primitive
values or objects. These values may be of any supported type except another
collection.

The SDK uses the List container type to define to-many relationships. A
**to-many** relationship means that an object is related in a specific
way to multiple objects.

For a list of the value types that a list property can hold, refer to 
:ref:`<sdks-list-property-types>`.

.. _flutter-create-Uint8List-property-type:

Create a Uint8List Property Type (Dart)
```````````````````````````````````````

The Flutter SDK provides a ``Uint8List`` from Dart. For more details about
defining a ``Uint8List`` type, refer to 
:ref:`dart-define-uint8list-property-type`.

To add ``Uint8List`` to a Realm object, call ``Uint8List.fromList()`` on the data.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/data_types_test.snippet.binary-from-list.dart
   :language: dart

.. _sdks-create-set-properties:

Create Set Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Like their native counterparts, the SDK's set data type stores unique values.
These values may be of any supported type except another collection.

The SDK uses the Set container type to define to-many relationships. A
**to-many** relationship means that an object is related in a specific
way to multiple objects.

For a list of the value types that a set property can hold, refer to 
:ref:`<sdks-set-property-types>`.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The SDK supports a dictionary (map) property type. Dictionary keys must be
strings, but values can be any of the supported value types. For a list of the
value types that a dictionary property can hold, refer to 
:ref:`<sdks-dictionary-property-types>`.

.. _sdks-create-relationship-property-types:

Create Relationship Properties
------------------------------

When you have a property whose type references another SDK object, this creates
a relationship between the objects. This can be a to-one, to-many, or
inverse relationship. For more information about relationships, refer to
:ref:`sdks-relationships`.

.. _sdks-create-to-one-relationship:

Create a To-One Relationship
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a new object instance with a 
:ref:`to-one relationship <sdks-to-one-relationship>`
property, instantiate both objects and pass the referenced object to the
relationship property. 

You can optionally create an inverse relationship to refer to the main object
from the related object. For more information, refer to the  
:ref:`sdks-create-object-with-inverse-relationship` section on this page.

.. _sdks-create-to-many-relationship:

Create a To-Many Relationship
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a new object instance with a 
:ref:`to-many relationship <sdks-to-many-relationship>`
property, instantiate all objects and pass any referenced objects to the
relationship collection property.

You may use a List or a Set to represent a to-many relationship, depending
on whether you require the values to be unique, or whether you want to use any
of the special collection type methods.

You can optionally create an inverse relationship to refer to the main object
from the related object. For more information, refer to the 
:ref:`sdks-create-object-with-inverse-relationship` section on this page.

Create an Inverse Relationship
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a new object instance with an 
:ref:`inverse relationship <sdks-inverse-relationship>`
property, instantiate the parent object and pass any referenced child
objects to the inverse relationship property. 

After you create an object that has an inverse relationship, you can access
the inverse relationship property to get the child objects. However, you
*cannot* directly modify the backlink itself. For more information, refer to 
:ref:`<sdks-update-inverse-relationships>`.

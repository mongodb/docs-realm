This page describes the concepts of write transactions and managed objects in 
a database, then explains how to create and persist a new object to a local or 
synced database using Atlas Device SDK. To learn more about object models and 
how to define them, refer to :ref:`sdks-object-models`.

You can create objects whose object type is managed by the database instance. 
For more information, refer to 
:ref:`sdks-configure-and-open-database` or 
:ref:`sdks-configure-and-open-synced-database`.

.. note:: Write to a Synced Database

   The syntax to write a new object to the database is the same for a local or
   a synced database. However, there are additional considerations that determine
   whether the write operation in a synced database is successful. For more 
   information, refer to :ref:`sdks-write-synced-database`.

.. _sdks-write-transactions:

Write Transactions
------------------

The Atlas Device SDK persistence layer handles writes in terms of transactions.
All writes must happen within a transaction. A **transaction** is a list of
read and write operations that the database treats as a single indivisible
operation: either *all* of the operations succeed or *none* of the operations
in the transaction take effect.

The SDK represents each transaction as a callback function
that contains zero or more read and write operations. To run
a transaction, you define a transaction callback and pass it to
one of the database's write methods. Within this callback, you can access a 
database instance and then create, read, update, and delete objects within the
database.

A database file allows only one open write transaction at a time. The SDK
blocks other writes on other threads until the open transaction on the database
file is complete. This means there is never a race condition when reading
values from the database within a transaction.

When you are done with your transaction, the SDK either commits it or cancels
it:

- When the SDK commits a transaction, it writes all changes to disk. For
  synced databases, the SDK then queues the change for synchronization with the
  backend.
- When the SDK cancels a write transaction or an operation in
  the transaction causes an error, all changes are discarded.

.. _sdks-managed-vs-unmanaged-objects:

Managed and Unmanaged Objects
-----------------------------

The SDK's APIs may refer to objects as managed or unmanaged. When you create 
an object with the SDK, it is unmanaged until it is added to the database,
which creates a managed instance.

- **Managed objects** are SDK objects that persist in a database instance. 
  Managed objects can only be accessed from an open database file. They can be
  updated with changes within write transactions as long as that database 
  remains open. Managed objects are tied to the database instance from which
  they originated and cannot be directly written to another database. However,
  the SDK supplies a method to copy managed objects from one database file to
  another.

  You can use the SDK's APIs with managed objects. For example, managed
  objects can have relationships with other objects and you can observe them
  for changes. You can also create an unmanaged copy of a managed object. 
  Refer to the :ref:`Create an Unmanaged Copy of an Object or Collection 
  <sdks-create-unmanaged-copy>` section on this page. 

- **Unmanaged objects** are SDK objects that behave like normal Kotlin objects, 
  but they are not persisted in the database. All SDK objects are unmanaged
  until you add them to a database within a write transaction.
  You cannot use the SDK's APIs with unmanaged objects or observe them for
  changes.

.. tip:: 

   You can check if an object is managed with the 
   ``isManaged`` API.

Create a Realm Object
---------------------

Before you can create a new object and persist it to the realm, you must 
:ref:`sdks-object-models`. Then, you include that object type in your database
schema when you open the database.

.. important:: Object Types Must Be in Your Schema

   You can only write objects whose object type is included in the database
   schema. If you try to reference or write an object of an object type 
   that isn't in your schema, the SDK returns a schema validation error.

To create a new object and persist it to the database:

Create an Embedded Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a new embedded object instance, assign an instance of an 
:ref:`embedded object type <sdks-embedded-objects>` to a 
parent object's property. This can be in a one-to-one, one-to-many, or 
inverse :ref:`relationship <sdks-relationships>` 
depending on how you defined the embedded object within the parent 
object type.

.. note:: Embedded Objects Must Be Created Within a Parent Object

   An embedded object requires a parent object and *cannot* exist as an 
   independent SDK object. 

Embedded objects have strict ownership with their parent object.
After you create the embedded object, you *cannot* reassign it to a 
different parent object or share it between multiple parent objects.

Asymmetric objects are write-only. Once inserted, the asymmetric object syncs
to Atlas. You *cannot* access the managed data locally, remove it from the

The Atlas Device SDK query engine implements standard `LINQ
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/introduction-to-linq-queries>`__
syntax.

There are several operators available to filter an SDK collection with LINQ. 
Filters work by evaluating an operator expression for every object in the 
collection being filtered. If the expression resolves to ``true``, the SDK
includes the object in the results collection.

An expression consists of one of the following:

- The name of a property of the object currently being evaluated
- An operator
- A value of any type used by the SDK (string, date, number, boolean, etc.)

.. note:: 

   The SDK does not currently support all of the LINQ operators. Refer to the
   :ref:`sdks-dotnet-unsupported-linq` section on this page for a list of
   those unsupported operators.

Comparison Operators

Value comparisons

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - | ``==``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand expression is equal to the 
       right-hand expression.

   * - | ``>``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand numerical or date expression is 
       greater than the right-hand numerical or date expression. For dates, this 
       evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand date is later than the right-hand 
       date.

   * - | ``>=``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand numerical or date expression is 
       greater than or equal to the right-hand numerical or date expression. For 
       dates, this evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand date is later than or 
       the same as the right-hand date.

   * - | ``<``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand numerical or date expression is 
       less than the right-hand numerical or date expression. For dates, this 
       evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand date is earlier than the 
       right-hand date.

   * - | ``<=``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand numeric expression is less than 
       or equal to the right-hand numeric expression. For dates, this evaluates 
       to ``true`` if the left-hand date is earlier than or the same as the 
       right-hand date.

   * - | ``!=``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand expression is not equal to the 
       right-hand expression.

.. example::

   The following example uses the query engine's
   comparison operators to:

   - Find high priority tasks by comparing the value of the ``priority`` property 
     value with a threshold number, above which priority can be considered high.
   - Find just-started or short-running tasks by seeing if the ``progressMinutes`` 
     property falls within a certain range.
   - Find unassigned tasks by finding tasks where the ``assignee`` property is 
     equal to ``null``.
   - Find tasks assigned to specific teammates Ali or Jamie by seeing if the 
     ``assignee`` property is in a list of names.

Logical Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the logical operators listed in the following table to make compound 
predicates:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - | ``&&``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if both left-hand and right-hand expressions are 
       ``true``.

   * - | ``!``
     - Negates the result of the given expression.

   * - | ``||``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if either expression returns ``true``.

.. example::

   We can use the query language's logical operators to find
   all of Ali's completed tasks. That is, we find all tasks
   where the ``assignee`` property value is equal to 'Ali' AND
   the ``isComplete`` property value is ``true``:

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/QueryEngineExamples.snippet.logical.cs
      :language: csharp

String Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can compare string values using the string operators listed in the following 
table. Regex-like wildcards allow more flexibility in search.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 60

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - ``StartsWith``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string expression begins with the 
       right-hand string expression. This is similar to ``contains``, but only 
       matches if the left-hand string expression is found at the beginning of 
       the right-hand string expression.

   * - | ``EndsWith``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string expression ends with the 
       right-hand string expression. This is similar to ``contains``, but only 
       matches if the left-hand string expression is found at the very end of 
       the right-hand string expression.

   * - | ``Like``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string expression
       matches the right-hand string wildcard string
       expression. A wildcard string expression is a string
       that uses normal characters with two special wildcard
       characters:

       - The ``*`` wildcard matches zero or more of any character
       - The ``?`` wildcard matches any character.

       For example, the wildcard string "d?g" matches "dog",
       "dig", and "dug", but not "ding", "dg", or "a dog".

   * - | ``Equals``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string is 
       `lexicographically <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_order>`_ 
       equal to the right-hand string.

   * - | ``Contains``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string expression is found anywhere 
       in the right-hand string expression.

   * - | ``string.IsNullOrEmpty``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string expression is null or empty.
       Note that ``IsNullOrEmpty()`` is a static method on ``string``. 

.. example::

   The following examples use the query engine's string operators to find
   tasks:

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/QueryEngineExamples.snippet.strings.cs
      :language: csharp

.. important:: Case Comparisons

   When evaluating strings, the second parameter in all functions *except* ``Like`` 
   must be either ``StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase`` or 
   ``StringComparison.Ordinal``. For the ``Like()`` method, the second 
   parameter is a boolean value (where "true" means "case sensitive").

Full Text Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use LINQ to query on properties that have :ref:`enabled Full-Text Search
<sdks-fts-property>` (FTS). To query these properties, use
:dotnet-sdk:`QueryMethods.FullTextSearch 
<reference/Realms.QueryMethods.html#Realms_QueryMethods_FullTextSearch_System_String_System_String_>`.
The following examples query the ``Person.Biography`` field:

Unsupported LINQ Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following LINQ operators are not currently supported by the SDK:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 60

   * - Category
     - Unsupported Operators

   * - | Concatenation
     -   - ``Concat``
         - ``Join``. While ``Join`` is not supported, it is not needed with
           the SDK. Instead of using keys in a Join statement, as you would in
           a traditional relational database, you can reference another type
           as a property. For more information, refer to :ref:`sdks-relationships`.
         - ``GroupJoin``
   
   * - | Grouping
     -   - ``GroupBy``

   * - | Partitioning
     -    - ``Take``
          - ``Skip``
          - ``TakeWhile``
          - ``SkipWhile``
  
   * - | Projection
     -   - ``SelectMany``
         - ``Select``, with one exception: when used with the query syntax, ``Select`` 
           is supported as long as you select the Realm object itself and not a 
           derivative:
           
           ``var tasks = from t in realm.All<Task>() where t.Assignee == "Caleb" select t;``

   * - | Sets
     -   - ``Distinct``
         - ``Union``
         - ``Intersect``
         - ``Except``

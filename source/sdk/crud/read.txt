This page describes how to query and read objects from the a database 
with Atlas Device SDK. You can read the data that you have
:ref:`written <sdks-write-transactions>` to the database by finding,
filtering, and sorting objects.

A read from the database generally consists of the following steps:

- Get all objects of a certain type from the database instance.
- Optionally, filter the results.
- Optionally, sort the results.

.. _sdks-results-are-not-copies:

Results Are Not Copies
``````````````````````

Unless you are working with frozen objects, results to a query are not copies
of your data. Modifying the results of a query modifies the data on disk
directly. This memory mapping also means that results are **live**: that is,
they always reflect the current state on disk.

For more details about live versus frozen objects, refer to
:ref:`sdks-live-and-frozen-objects`.

.. _sdks-results-are-lazy:

Results Are Lazy
````````````````

The SDK only runs a query when you actually request the results of that query.
This lazy evaluation enables you to write highly performant code for handling
large data sets and complex queries. You can chain several filter operations
without requiring extra work to process the intermediate state.

.. _sdks-references-retained:

References Are Retained
```````````````````````

Atlas Device SDK automatically retains all of an object's :ref:`relationships
<sdks-relationships>` as direct references. This enables you to traverse your
graph of relationships directly through the results of a query.

A **direct reference**, or pointer, allows you to access a related object's
properties directly through the reference.

Other databases typically copy objects from database storage into application
memory when you need to work with them directly. Because application objects
contain direct references, you are left with a choice: copy the object
referred to by each direct reference out of the database in case it's needed,
or copy the foreign key for each object and query for the object with that key
if it's accessed. If you choose to copy referenced objects into application
memory, you can use up a lot of resources for objects that are never accessed.
If you copy only the foreign key, referenced object lookups can cause your
application to slow down.

The SDK bypasses all of this using zero-copy live objects. Database object
accessors point directly into database storage using memory mapping, so there
is no distinction between the objects in the database and the results of your
query in application memory. Because of this, you can traverse direct
references across an entire database from any query result.

.. _sdks-limiting-results:

Limiting Query Results
``````````````````````

As a result of lazy evaluation, you do not need any special mechanism to
limit query results with the SDK. For example, if your query matches thousands
of objects, but you only want to load the first ten, access only the first ten
elements of the results collection. None of the remaining objects are loaded
into memory.

.. _sdks-pagination:

Pagination
``````````

With lazy evaluation, pagination is very direct. Consider a query that matches
thousands of objects in your realm. Your app displays one hundred objects per
page. To advance to any page, access the elements of the results collection
starting at the index that corresponds to the target page.

.. _sdks-read-query-objects:

Filter or Query Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **filter** selects a subset of results based on the value(s) of one or more
object properties. The most common use case is to find objects where a certain
property matches a certain value. Additionally, you can compare strings,
aggregate over collections of numbers, and use logical operators to build up
complex queries.

The SDK provides several full-featured query engines you
can use to define filters. The core query engine uses :ref:`Realm Query
Language (RQL) <realm-query-language>` to construct queries. RQL is a
string-based query language that you can use to retrieve objects from the
database. Some of the SDK languages provide special query APIs that provide
idiomatic query syntax and features. The available query APIs include:

- :ref:`RQL <realm-query-language>`: C++, C#, Dart, Java, JavaScript, Kotlin,
  TypeScript
- :ref:`LINQ <sdks-dotnet-linq>`: C#
- :ref:`Type-Safe and NSPredicate Queries <sdks-filter-data-swift>`: Swift,
  Objective-C
- :ref:`Fluent Interface <sdks-java-filter-data>`: Java, Kotlin (Java SDK)

For more details about the supported operators when using each of these query
APIs, refer to the query engine for your preferred language.

.. _sdks-read-access-results:

Access Results
``````````````

When you perform a query operation, and the query is valid, the SDK returns a
results collection that contains 0 or more objects matching your query.

The SDK provides convenience methods to make it easier to work with the results.
The available methods vary depending on the SDK language.

in RQL LIMIT() clauses. Instead, use strings or string interpolation.

.. tip::

   Don't do derived queries on top of class projection results. Instead, run a 
   query against the SDK object directly and then project the result. If you 
   try to do a derived query on top of class projection results, querying a 
   field with the same name and type as the original object works, but querying 
   a field with a name or type that isn't in the original object fails.

method.

.. tip:: Device Sync Always Uses _id as Primary Key
   
   If you use Atlas Device Sync, you can always query by the primary key 
   field ``_id``. This is because the Device Sync data model requires 
   objects have a primary key named ``_id``. For more information, refer to 
   :ref:`<sdks-model-data-device-sync>`.

SDK Results Collections
-----------------------

Placeholder. Add some concept information about results being a special SDK
auto-updating collection type for read operations (except in Kotlin, where it's
frozen).

.. _sdks-query-engines:

Filter Data
-----------

Placeholder. Add some concept information about the SDK having query engines,
and the one you use varying depending on the SDK you're using. i.e.:

- RQL (C++ (subset only), C#, Dart, JS, Kotlin, TS, maybe also Java/Java Kotlin?)
- LINQ (C#)
- Swift SDK (Swift & Objective-C Type-Safe queries and NS Predicate queries)
- Java (Java & Kotlin, Fluent Interface)

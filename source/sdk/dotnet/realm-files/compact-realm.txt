Overview
--------
Over time, the storage space used by Realm might become fragmented 
and take up more space than necessary. To rearrange the internal storage and 
potentially reduce the file size, you can compact the realm file.

.. important:: File must not be in use
  
   Realm cannot compact a file that is in use. Be sure there are no open 
   instances that use the file.

Realm reduces the file size by writing a new (compact) version of the file, and 
then replacing the original with the newly-written file. Therefore, to compact, 
you must have free storage space equivalent to the original realm file size. 

.. tip:: Implement Compacting in Your Production Application

   Every production application should implement :dotnet-sdk:`ShouldCompactOnLaunch 
   <reference/Realms.RealmConfiguration.html#Realms_RealmConfiguration_ShouldCompactOnLaunch>` 
   to periodically reduce the realm file size. For more information
   about compacting a realm, see: :ref:`<dotnet-when-to-compact-a-realm>`.

Compaction Options
------------------
You can configure realm to automatically compact the database each time a
realm is opened, or you can compact the file without first obtaining a
realm instance.

Realm Configuration File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can configure Realm to check the realm file each time 
it is opened by specifying a 
:dotnet-sdk:`ShouldCompactDelegate <reference/Realms.RealmConfiguration.ShouldCompactDelegate.html>` 
in the configuration. The following code example shows how to do this:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/Compact.snippet.config-compact.cs
   :language: csharp

If the delegate returns ``true`` -- and the file is not in use -- the realm file 
is compacted prior to making the instance available.


Realm.Compact() Method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Alternatively, you can compact a realm file without first obtaining an instance 
to the realm by calling the 
:dotnet-sdk:`Compact() <reference/Realms.Realm.html#Realms_Realm_Compact_Realms_RealmConfigurationBase_>`
method. The following example shows how to do this:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/Compact.snippet.manual-compact.cs
   :language: csharp

The ``Compact`` method will return true if the operation is successful.

When to Compact a Realm
-----------------------

Compacting a realm can be an expensive operation that can block 
the UI thread. Your application should not compact every time you open 
a realm. Instead, try to optimize compacting so your application does 
it just often enough to prevent the file size from growing too large. 
If your application runs in a resource-constrained environment,
you may want to compact when you reach a certain file size or when the 
file size negatively impacts performance.

These recommendations can help you start optimizing compaction for your 
application:

- Set the max file size to a multiple of your average realm state
  size. If your average realm state size is 10MB, you might set the max 
  file size to 20MB or 40MB, depending on expected usage and device
  constraints.
- As a starting point, compact realms when more than 50% of the realm file 
  size is no longer in use. Divide the currently used bytes by the total 
  file size to determine the percentage of space that is currently used. 
  Then, check for that to be less than 50%. This means that greater than 
  50% of your realm file size is unused space, and it is a good time to 
  compact. After experimentation, you may find a different percentage 
  works best for your application.

These calculations might look like this in your delegate:

.. code-block:: csharp

   // Set a maxFileSize equal to 20MB in bytes
   var maxFileSize = 20 * 1024 * 1024;

   /* Check for the realm file size to be greater than the max file size, 
    * and the amount of bytes currently used to be less than 50% of the
    * total realm file size */
   return (totalBytes > (double)maxFileSize) ||
      ((double)usedBytes / totalBytes > 0.5);

Experiment with conditions to find the right balance of how often to 
compact realm files in your application.

Overview
--------

This page contains information on how to install and integrate {+service+} into
your Unity project. 


Prerequisites
-------------
- Unity `2020.3.12f1 (LTS) <https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive>`_ or later

.. note::

    The :doc:`{+service-short+} .NET SDK </sdk/dotnet>` may be compatible
    with other versions of Unity, but ``2020.3.12f1 (LTS)`` is the version that
    the {+service-short+} team uses for testing and development. We recommend
    using this version to ensure your project works with {+service-short+} and
    that the install steps match the steps below since Unity's UI often changes
    between versions. 

Install
-------
{+service-short+} provides various ways to install the :doc:`{+service-short+}
.NET SDK </sdk/dotnet>` for use with Unity. Experienced Unity developers may
find installing {+service-short+} manually with a tarball to be intuitive.
However, we recommend installing the :doc:`{+service-short+} .NET SDK
</sdk/dotnet>` via npm since it provides opt-in `notifications of version
updates through Unity's package manager
<https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.package-manager-ui@2.0/manual/index.html#PackManUpdate>`_.

Using {+service-short+} in Your Unity Project
---------------------------------------------
When developing with :doc:`{+service-short+} .NET SDK </sdk/dotnet>`, the API
methods are the same regardless of whether you use Unity or another platform.
However, since Unity has some `scripting restrictions
<https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptingRestrictions.html>`_, you should keep
the following additional considerations in mind when developing your project:

- Unity does not support the `dynamic keyword <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/types/using-type-dynamic>`_ when using `IL2CPP  <https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/IL2CPP.html>`_. This meaning all types used in C# scripts must be known at compile time. When you use the {+service-short+} .NET SDK with Unity, you must convert dynamic types to concrete types. To view the full list of limitations, see the Unity `scripting limitations <https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptingRestrictions.html>`_ documentation.
- Although the {+service-short+} .NET SDK exposes the :dotnet-sdk:`Dynamic API<reference/Realms.Realm.Dynamic.html?q=dynamic>`, we recommend it only when performing migrations.
- Unity performs `managed code stripping <https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ManagedCodeStripping.html>`_, discarding any unused code from a build to reduce binary size. This may lead to issues when deserializing :manual:`BSON </reference/bson-types/>` into C# classes. For platforms, such as iOS, that use `IL2CPP <https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/IL2CPP.html>`_ managed code stripping is enabled by default. When working with BSON, you can use the `preserve <https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Scripting.PreserveAttribute.html>`_ attribute by applying ``[Preserve]`` to prevent managed code stripping on types properties that are only populated by the serializer. Since those properties use `reflection <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/reflection>`_, Unity cannot statically infer that the property setter is used. This means that unless you apply the ``preserve attribute``, Unity will strip those properties away.
- The {+service-short+} .NET SDK cannot be accessed within the `AppDomain.DomainUnload Event <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.appdomain.domainunload?view=net-5.0>`_ or the `Application.quitting <https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Application-quitting.html>`_ event. This means you cannot :doc:`close a realm </sdk/dotnet/examples/open-and-close-a-local-realm>` when the player application is quitting. We recommend closing a {+realm+} on a background thread. However, if you opened a {+realm+} using the `ScriptableObject.OnEnable <https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnEnable.html>`_ method, you should dispose it within a `ScriptableObject.OnDisable() <https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/ScriptableObject.OnDisable.html>`_ cleanup method, which is called when a scriptable object, such as a GameController, goes out of scope.

Additional Examples
--------------------
The {+service+} community has created the following projects that demonstrate the
usage of the :doc:`{+service-short+} .NET SDK </sdk/dotnet>` with Unity.

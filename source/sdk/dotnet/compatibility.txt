Android Deployment
------------------
Due to some instruction set limitations, {+service-short+} does not support 
deploying Android apps to the ``armeabi`` ABI. Default templates often 
have different ABI settings for Debug and Release modes, and so an Android 
application that works in Debug mode may throw a ``System.TypeInitializationException`` 
exception in Release mode if the ``armeabi`` ABI is selected.

To avoid this, you should verify the ABI settings for both Debug and Release modes.
The `Visual Studio CPU Architectures <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/android/app-fundamentals/cpu-architectures>`_ 
page provides instructions for setting these in Visual Studio for Mac and Windows.

Unless you have a good reason to avoid linking other ABIs, we recommend 
checking all of the settings other than ``armabi``:

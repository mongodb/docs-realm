Overview
--------

In the following example, assume that each schema change occurs 
after the developer has used each version for some
amount of time. New schema version numbers only apply once you open the Realm 
with an updated schema and explicitly specify the new version number, so to get to 
version 4, you would first need to open the app with versions 2 and 3.

A {+realm+} using schema version ``1`` has a ``Person`` object type:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/Migrations/PersonClassV1/PersonClassV1.cs
    :language: csharp
    :emphasize-lines: 3

First, the developer decides to add a "LastName" property:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/Migrations/PersonClassV2/PersonClassV2.cs
    :language: csharp
    :emphasize-lines: 4


The developer decides that the ``Person`` class should use a combined
``FullName`` field instead of the separate ``FirstName`` and
``LastName`` fields:


.. literalinclude:: /examples/Migrations/PersonClassV3/PersonClassV3.cs
    :language: csharp
    :emphasize-lines: 3

Lastly, the developer decides to modify the ``Age`` property by renaming it to
``Birthday`` and changing the type to ``DateTimeOffset``:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/Migrations/PersonClassV4/PersonClassV4.cs
    :language: csharp
    :emphasize-lines: 4

To migrate the {+realm+} to conform to the updated ``Person`` schema, the
developer sets the {+realm+}'s :ref:`schema version <dotnet-schema-version>` to
``4`` and defines a migration function to set the value of
``FullName`` based on the existing ``FirstName`` and ``LastName``
properties and the value of ``Birthday`` based on ``Age``:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/Migrations/LocalMigration/LocalMigration.cs
    :language: csharp
    :emphasize-lines: 3, 21, 25, 31

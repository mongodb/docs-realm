Create an Object Model
----------------------
Realm classes are regular C# classes that define the Realm schema.

Object Schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An **object schema** is a configuration object that defines the properties and 
relationships of a Realm object. Realm client 
applications define object schemas with the native class implementation in their 
respective language using the Object Schema.

Object schemas specify constraints on object properties such as the data
type of each property and whether or not a property is required. Schemas can 
also define :ref:`relationships <dotnet-client-relationships>` between object 
types in a realm.

Every App has a :ref:`App Services Schema <dotnet-realm-schema>`
composed of a list of object schemas for each type of object that the
realms in that application may contain. Realm guarantees that all 
objects in a realm conform to the
schema for their object type and validates objects whenever they're
created, modified, or deleted.

Property Annotations
--------------------
Schema properties are standard C# properties on a ``RealmObject``. There are 
several property annotations that you can use to more finely define how a Realm 
handles a specific property.

.. _dotnet-primary-key-example:
.. _dotnet-primary-key:

Primary Key
~~~~~~~~~~~

A **primary key** is a property that uniquely identifies an object. You can
create a primary key with any of the following types (or their nullable counterparts):

- ``ObjectId``
- ``UUID``
- ``string``
- ``char``
- ``byte``
- ``short``
- ``int``
- ``long``

You may define a primary key on a **single property** for an 
object type as part of the :ref:`object schema <dotnet-object-schema>`.
Realm Database automatically indexes primary key properties, which
allows you to efficiently read and modify objects based on their primary
key. 

If an object type has a primary key, then all objects of that type must
include the primary key property with a value that is unique among
objects of the same type in a realm.

.. note::
   
   Once you assign a property as a primary key, you cannot change it.
   
The following example demonstrates how to designate a primary key in an object schema:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/Objects.snippet.primary-key.cs
   :language: csharp

.. _dotnet-index-field:

Indexes
~~~~~~~

**Indexes** support the efficient execution of queries in
Realm Database. Without indexes, Realm Database must perform a
*collection scan*, i.e. scan every document in a collection, to select
those documents that match a query. If an appropriate index exists for a
query, Realm Database can use the index to limit the number of
documents that it must inspect.

Indexes are special data structures that store a small portion of a
realm's data in an easy to traverse form. The index stores the value
of a specific property ordered by the value of the property. The ordering of
the index entries supports efficient equality matches and range-based
query operations.

Adding an index can speed up some queries at the cost of slightly slower write
times and additional storage and memory overhead. Indexes require space in your
realm file, so adding an index to a property will increase disk space consumed
by your realm file. Each index entry is a minimum of 12 bytes.

You can index properties with the following types:

- ``bool``
- ``byte``
- ``short``
- ``int``
- ``long``
- ``DateTimeOffset``
- ``char``
- ``string``
- ``ObjectId``
- ``UUID``


To index a property, use the :dotnet-sdk:`[Indexed] <reference/Realms.IndexedAttribute.html>`
attribute:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/Objects.snippet.index.cs
   :language: csharp


.. _dotnet-required-field:
.. _dotnet-optional-field:
.. _dotnet-required-optional-property:

Required and Optional Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In C#, value types are implicitly non-nullable, but can be made optional by appending 
`?  <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/nullable-value-types>`__.
Reference types, such as ``string`` and ``byte[]``, are implicitly nullable and can be
made required by annotating them with the ``[Required]`` attribute. Properties of types
that inherit from ``IRealmObject`` or ``IEmbeddedObject`` are special and can always be
null. Applying ``[Required]`` on such a property will result in a compilation error.

You can use the ``[Required]`` attribute as seen in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/Objects.snippet.required.cs
   :language: csharp

.. _dotnet-default-field-values:

Default Field Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the built-in language features to assign a default value to a property. 
In C#, you can assign a default value in the property declaration. 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/Objects.snippet.default.cs
   :language: csharp

.. note:: Default Values and Nullability

   While default values ensure that a newly created object cannot contain
   a value of ``null`` (unless you specify a default value of ``null``),
   they do not impact the nullability of a property. To make a property
   non-nullable, see :ref:`Required Properties <dotnet-required-optional-property>`.

.. _dotnet-ignore-a-property:
.. _dotnet-ignore-property:

Ignore a Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you don't want to save a property in your model to a realm, you can
ignore that property. A property is ignored by default if it is not autoimplemented or 
does not have a setter.

Ignore a property from a Realm object model with the
:dotnet-sdk:`[Ignored] <reference/Realms.IgnoredAttribute.html>` attribute:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/Objects.snippet.ignore.cs
   :language: csharp
.. _dotnet-rename-property:

Rename a Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, Realm Database uses the name defined in the model class
to represent properties internally. In some cases you might want to change
this behavior:

- To make it easier to work across platforms, since naming conventions differ.
- To change a property name in .NET without forcing a migration.

Choosing an internal name that differs from the name used in model classes
has the following implications:

- Migrations must use the internal name when creating classes and properties.
- Schema errors reported will use the internal name.

Use the :dotnet-sdk:`[MapTo] <reference/Realms.MapToAttribute.html>`
attribute to rename a property:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/Objects.snippet.rename.cs
   :language: csharp

.. _dotnet-rename-object:

Rename a Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, Realm Database uses the name defined in the model class
to represent classes internally. In some cases you might want to change
this behavior:

- To support multiple model classes with the same simple name in different namespaces.
- To make it easier to work across platforms, since naming conventions differ.
- To use a class name that is longer than the 57 character limit enforced by Realm Database.
- To change a class name in .NET without forcing a migration.

Use the :dotnet-sdk:`[MapTo] <reference/Realms.MapToAttribute.html>`
attribute to rename a class:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/Objects.snippet.rename-class.cs
   :language: csharp


.. _dotnet-customer-setter:

Custom Setters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Realm will not store a property with a custom setter. To use a custom setter, 
store the property value in a private property and then 
map that value to a public property with the custom setter. Realm will store the 
private property, while you modify its value via the public property.
In the following code, the private ``email`` property is stored in the realm, 
but the public ``Email`` property, which provides validation, is not persisted:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/Objects.snippet.custom-setter.cs
   :language: csharp

.. _dotnet-omit-classes-from-schema:
.. _dotnet-provide-subset-classes-schema:

Omit Classes from your Realm Schema
-----------------------------------

By default, your application's Realm Schema includes all
classes that implement ``IRealmObject`` or ``IEmbeddedObject``. 
If you only want to include a subset of these classes in your Realm
Schema, you can update your configuration to include the specific classes you want:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/Objects.snippet.subset.cs
   :language: csharp

.. _mvvm_data_binding:

Data Binding and MVVM
---------------------
When building a MAUI/Xamarin app using the 
`MVVM <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/xaml/xaml-basics/data-bindings-to-mvvm>`_ 
pattern, you often want proper data binding *in both directions* between the 
View and ViewModel: if a property value changes in the UI, the ViewModel should 
be notified, and vice-versa. ViewModels typically implement 
the `INotifyPropertyChange <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.componentmodel.inotifypropertychanged?view=net-5.0>`_ 
interface to ensure this. 

However, when you bind UI elements to a :dotnet-sdk:`RealmObject <reference/Realms.RealmObject.html>`, 
this notification happens automatically, thus greatly simplifying your ViewModel code. 

You can also bind a UI element to a realm :ref:`Live Query <dotnet-live-queries>`. 
For example, if you bind a 
`ListView <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/xamarin.forms.listview?view=xamarin-forms>`_ 
to a live query, then the list will update automatically when the results of the 
query change; you do not need to implement the ``INotifyPropertyChange`` 
interface.

For example, if you bind a ListView to a query that returns all Product 
objects, the list of available products updates automatically 
when a product is added, changed, or removed from the realm:

.. code-block:: csharp
   :copyable: false

   // Somewhere in your ViewModel
   AllProducts = realm.All<Products>();

.. code-block:: xaml
   :copyable: false
   
   <!-- Somewhere in your View -->
   <ListView ItemsSource="{Binding AllProducts}">

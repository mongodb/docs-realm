Overview
--------
A Realm list implements 
`IList<T> <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.ilist-1?view=net-5.0>`_,
and contains zero or more instances of a 
:ref:`Realm type <dotnet-objects>`. Like a C# ``List``, 
a Realm collection is homogenous (all objects in a collection are of 
the same type).

Lists
-----

Realm objects can contain lists of any supported data type. 
You create a collection by defining a getter-only property of type
`IList<T> <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.ilist-1?view=net-5.0>`_,
where ``T`` can be any data type (except other collections). A list of realm 
objects represents a :ref:`to-many relationship <dotnet-to-many-relationship>` 
between two Realm types, the containing class and the type in the list. 

Lists are mutable: within a write transaction, you can add and remove elements 
on a list. 

Lists and Nullability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deleting an object from the database will remove it from any lists 
where it existed. Therefore, a list of objects will never contain deleted objects.
However, lists of primitive types can contain null values. If you do not 
want to allow null values in a list, then either use non-nullable types in 
the list declaration (for example, use ``IList<double>`` instead of 
``IList<double?>``), or add the 
:ref:`[Required]<dotnet-required-optional-property>` attribute if the list  
contains nullable reference types, such as ``string`` or ``byte[]``.

.. important:: Not Supported with Sync

   Local-only Realm Databases support collections of nullable (optional) values, 
   but ``Sync`` does not.
   
For more information, refer to :ref:`<dotnet-required-optional-property>`.

Watching For Changes
---------------------

``IList`` implements the `INotifyPropertyChanged.PropertyChanged 
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.componentmodel.inotifypropertychanged.propertychanged>`__ 
event. In the following code example, we have a class with an 
``IList<string>`` property named ``StringList``. We cast this property to an 
:dotnet-sdk:`IRealmCollection <reference/Realms.IRealmCollection-1.html>` and 
set an event handler for the ``PropertyChanged`` event:

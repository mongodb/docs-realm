.. _dotnet-read-from-realm:

Read from Realm Database
------------------------

A read from a realm generally consists of the following
steps:

- Get all :ref:`objects <dotnet-objects>` of a certain type from the realm.
- Optionally, :ref:`filter <dotnet-filter-results>` the results using the :ref:`query engine <dotnet-client-query-engine>`.
- Optionally, :ref:`sort <dotnet-sort-results>` the results.

.. note:: About the examples on this page

   The examples on this page use the data model of a project
   management app that has two Realm object types: ``Project``
   and ``Task``. A ``Project`` has zero or more ``Tasks``.

   See the schema for these two classes, ``Project`` and
   ``Task``, below:

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/Schemas/ProjectAndTask.cs
      :language: csharp

Find a Specific Object by Primary Key
-------------------------------------

You can also find a specific item by its primary key using the 
:dotnet-sdk:`Find <reference/Realms.Realm.html#Realms_Realm_Find__1_System_Nullable_System_Int64__>`
method, as shown in the following example: 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/Query/FindByPrimaryKey.cs
   :language: csharp

.. _dotnet-query-all-objects-of-a-given-type:

Query All Objects of a Given Type
---------------------------------

The first step of any read is to **get all objects** of a
certain type in a realm. With this results collection, you
can operate on all instances on a type or filter and sort to
refine the results.

.. example::

   In order to access all instances of ``Project`` and ``Task``, use
   the following syntax:

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/CRUD/Objects.cs
      :language: csharp

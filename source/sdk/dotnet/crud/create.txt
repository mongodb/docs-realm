Create a Realm Object
---------------------

When creating or updating documents, all writes must happen in a 
:ref:`transaction <dotnet-write-transactions>`. 

The following code shows two methods for creating a new Realm object. In the 
first example, we create the object first, and then add it to the realm within 
a :dotnet-sdk:`WriteAsync() <reference/Realms.Realm.html#Realms_Realm_WriteAsync_System_Action_System_Threading_CancellationToken_>`
method. In the second example, we create the document within the ``WriteAsync`` 
block, which returns a realm object we can further work with.

Upsert a Realm Object
---------------------

Upserting a document is the same as creating a new one, except you set the 
optional ``update`` parameter to ``true``. In this example, we create a new 
``Person`` object with a unique ``Id``. We then try to insert a person with the 
same id. Because we have set the ``update`` parameter to ``true``, the existing 
record is updated.

Overview
--------
Over time, the storage space used by {+service-short+} might become fragmented 
and take up more space than necessary. To rearrange the internal storage and 
potentially reduce the file size, you can compact the {+service-short+} file.

.. important:: Realm file must not be in use
  
   Realm cannot compact a file that is in use. Be sure there are no open 
   instances that use the file.

Realm compacts the file by making a new, compacted version of the file, and then 
replacing the original with the newly-compacted file. Therefore, to compact, you 
must have free storage space equivalent to the original realm file size. 

Compaction Options
------------------
You can configure {+realm+} to automatically compact the database each time 
a {+service-short+} is opened, or you can compact the file without first 
obtaining a Realm instance.


Realm Configuration File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can configure {+service-short+} to check the {+service-short+} file each time 
it is opened by specifying a 
:dotnet-sdk:`ShouldCompactDelegate <reference/Realms.RealmConfiguration.ShouldCompactDelegate.html>` 
in the configuration. The following code example shows how to do this:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/Compact.codeblock.config-compact.cs

If the delegate returns ``true`` -- and the file is not in use -- the realm file 
is compacted prior to making the instance available.


Realm.Compact() Method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Alternatively, you can compact a realm file without first obtaining an instance 
to the Realm by calling the 
:dotnet-sdk:`Compact() <reference/Realms.Realm.html#Realms_Realm_Compact_Realms_RealmConfigurationBase_>`
method. The following example shows how to do this:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/Compact.codeblock.manual-compact.cs
   :language: csharp


Considerations
--------------

- There must not be any open realm instances that use the file.
- The file system should have free space for at least a full copy of the Realm 
  file.
- If any part of the operation fails, the Realm file is left untouched.
- The Compact method will return true if the operation is successful or false 
  if there are open Realm instances accessing the same file.
- To estimate the potential size gain by compacting a Realm, monitor your 
  database’s size between app launches and compact it if it crosses some
  threshold.

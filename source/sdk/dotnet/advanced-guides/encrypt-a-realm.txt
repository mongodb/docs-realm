Overview
--------
You can encrypt your local {+realm+} to ensure data security. For more information,
see :ref:`dotnet-realm-encryption`.

Storing & Reusing Keys
----------------------

You must pass the same encryption key when opening the encrypted {+realm+}
again. Apps should securely store the encryption key, typically in the target
platform's secure key/value pair storage. You can use :xamarin:`Xamarin Secure
Storage <essentials/secure-storage>` to simplify the access to underlying
storage. Ultimately, it is the developer's responsibility to ensure that
attackers cannot easily extract the key.

Example
-------

The following code demonstrates how to generate an encryption key and
open an encrypted {+realm+}:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/EncryptionExamples.codeblock.encrypt_a_realm.cs
   :language: csharp

Overview
--------

Realm's .NET SDK enables development of applications in C# for the .NET, 
`.NET MAUI <https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/maui>`__,
`UWP <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/>`__, `Xamarin
<https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin>`__, and `Unity
<https://unity.com/>`__ ecosystems.

For more information about specific version support for .NET, .NET MAUI, UWP, and
Xamarin,  see :ref:`Supported Platforms <dotnet_supported-platforms>`.

.. note::

   Integrating the Realm .NET SDK with Unity has different prerequisites and
   install steps than the ones below. Learn how to :doc:`Integrate Realm with
   Unity </sdk/dotnet/unity>`.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before getting started, ensure you have installed Visual Studio:

- `Visual Studio <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/>`__ 2015 Update 2 or later.
- `Visual Studio for Mac <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/>`__ 7.0 or later.

Installation

Follow these steps to add the Realm .NET SDK to your project.

.. important:: Install the SDK for all projects

   If you have a multi-platform solution, be sure to install the SDK for 
   **all of the platform projects**, even if the given project doesn't contain 
   any Realm-specific code.

Supported Platforms
-------------------
Realm supports the following platforms for developing Realm apps for iOS and 
.NET devices:

- Xamarin.iOS for iOS 9 or later, using native UI or Xamarin Forms
- Xamarin.Android for API level 16 or later, using native UI or Xamarin Forms 
- Xamarin.Mac for macOS 10.11 or later, using native UI or Xamarin Forms 
- .NET Framework 4.6.1 or later for Windows 8.1 or later 
- .NET Multi-platform App UI (MAUI) for non-Blazor mobile and desktop apps
- Universal Windows Platform (UWP) applications using .NET Standard 2.0 or later (Fall Creators Update) 
- .NET Core 2.0 or later on the following:

  - Ubuntu 16.04 or later
  - Debian 8 or later
  - RHEL 7.1 or later
  - macOS 10.11 or later
  - Windows 8.1 or later

You can use the following development environments to build Realm apps with 
the .NET SDK:

- Visual Studio 2015 Update 2 or higher for Windows
- Visual Studio for Mac 7.0 or higher
- Unity `2020.3.12f1 (LTS) <https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive>`__ 

.. note::

    The :doc:`Realm .NET SDK </sdk/dotnet>` may be compatible with
    other versions of Unity, but ``2020.3.12f1 (LTS)`` is the version that the
    Realm team uses for testing and development. We recommend using
    this version to ensure your project works with Realm and that
    the install steps match the :doc:`Integrate Realm with Unity
    </sdk/dotnet/unity>` documentation steps because Unity's UI
    often changes between versions.

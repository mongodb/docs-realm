Overview
--------

Atlas Device Sync automatically synchronizes data between client applications and 
an :ref:`Atlas App Services backend <realm-cloud>`. When a client 
device is online, Sync asynchronously synchronizes data in a 
background thread between the device and your backend App. 

When you use Sync in your client application, your implementation must match 
the Sync Mode you select in your backend App configuration. The Sync Mode
options are:

- Partition-Based Sync
- Flexible Sync

You can only use one Sync Mode for your application. You cannot mix 
Partition-Based Sync and Flexible Sync within the same App.

Partition-Based Sync
--------------------

When you select :ref:`Partition-Based Sync <partition-based-sync>` for your 
backend App configuration, your client implementation must include a 
partition value. This is the value of the :ref:`partition key 
<partition-key>` field you select when you configure Partition-Based Sync. 

The partition value determines which data the client application can access.

You pass in the partition value when you open a synced realm.

.. _dotnet-flexible-sync-fundamentals:

Flexible Sync
-------------

When you select :ref:`Flexible Sync <flexible-sync>` for your backend App 
configuration, your client implementation must include subscriptions to 
queries on :ref:`queryable fields <queryable-fields>`. Flexible Sync works 
by synchronizing data that matches query subscriptions you maintain in the 
client application. 

A subscription set contains a set of queries. Realm Flexible Sync returns 
documents matching those queries, where the user has the appropriate 
:ref:`permissions <flexible-sync-rules-and-permissions>` to read and/or 
read and write the documents. If documents match the query, but the client 
does not have the permission to read or write them, they do not sync to 
the client application.

You can form queries using :ref:`Realm Query Language <realm-query-language>`.

.. include:: /includes/note-unsupported-flex-sync-rql-operators.rst

Subscription sets are based on a specific type of :ref:`realm object <dotnet-objects>`. 
You might have multiple subscriptions if you have many types of realm objects.

To use Flexible Sync in your client application, open a synced realm 
with a flexible sync configuration. Then, manage subscriptions
to determine which documents to sync.

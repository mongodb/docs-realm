Overview
--------
.. versionadded:: 10.17.0

You can use :ref:`Asymmetric Sync <optimize-asymmetric-sync>` to stream 
data from a client application to a Flexible Sync-enabled Atlas App Services
App.

For example, you might want to sync data unidirectionally in IoT applications, 
such as a weather sensor sending data to the cloud. Asymmetric sync is also useful 
for writing other types of immutable data where you do not require conflict 
resolution, such as creating invoices from a retail app or logging application 
events.

Asymmetric Sync is optimized to provide performance improvements for heavy
client-side *insert-only* workloads.

.. important::

   You cannot query, modify, or delete Asymmetric objects from a client app.
   

Sync Data Unidirectionally from a Client Application
----------------------------------------------------

Before you set up Asymmetric sync, you need to understand the following rules:

- The C# objects that you will sync with Atlas must derive from the 
  :dotnet-sdk:`AsymmetricObject <reference/Realms.AsymmetricObject.html>` class.

- An object that derives from ``AsymmetricObject`` can contain 
  :dotnet-sdk:`EmbeddedObject <reference/Realms.EmbeddedObject.html>` types, 
  but not ``RealmObject`` types or other ``AsymmetricObject`` types.

- ``RealmObject`` and ``EmbeddedObject`` types cannot contain ``AsymmetricObject``
  types as properties. 

The process for syncing data asymmetrically is the same as 
standard :ref:`bi-directional sync <dotnet-client-quick-start>`, as long as the 
rules above are followed. The following code shows creating an Asymmetric object 
and syncing it with the backend. It also shows to queries that generate errors.

Overview
--------

{+service+} provides SDKs that help you connect your client apps to the {+service-short+} 
backend. The SDK provides the {+service+} functionality needed to 
authenticate users with any of the built-in :ref:`Authentication providers <authentication-providers>`, 
call backend :ref:`functions <functions>`, and directly access a 
:ref:`MongoDB database <mongodb-service>`. 

.. note:: Code Examples

   Each SDK section in the Realm documentation includes code examples for 
   accomplishing the functionality discussed here. Find the platform / language 
   you are working with and look under **Usage Examples**.

The App Client
----------------
When using the SDK to access the {+service-short+} backend, you start with 
the ``App`` object. It is from this 
object that all other functionality is provided. The ``App`` object is 
:ref:`initialized <dotnet-init-appclient>` with the Realm app ID, which you can 
:ref:`find in the Realm UI <find-your-app-id>`.

Authentication
--------------
One of the most challenging aspects of client development is implementing a 
robust and secure authentication system. With the {+service-short+} SDKs, however, you 
can use any of the {+service+} authentication providers with very minimal backend 
setup or client-side code required. With the authentication APIs, you can 
implement the following functionality:

- Creation of new user accounts
- User log-in and log-out
- :ref:`Multiple users logged on at the same time on the same device <dotnet-multi-user>`
- :ref:`Linking user accounts from different providers <dotnet-link-user-identities>`
- :ref:`Providing custom user data <dotnet-custom-user-data>`

For more information, see :ref:`Authenticate Users <dotnet-authenticate>`.

Calling Functions
-----------------
Using the {+service+} SDKs, you can call server-side functions, 
which enables you to reuse the same backend functionality from multiple client types 
without having to reproduce the logic client-side. Calling functions from your client code is 
then reduced to only a few lines of code. In addition, server-side functions can 
run in the context of a system user, giving them full access to MongoDB CRUD and 
Aggregation APIs regardless of any rules, roles, or permissions assigned to a 
collection.

For more information on calling functions, see :ref:`Call a Function <dotnet-call-a-function>`.

Accessing MongoDB
-----------------
The Realm SDKs include a APIs for accessing a MongoDB Atlas instance directly. 
With these APIs, you can perform all of the standard CRUD operations from your 
client. 

For more information on the MongoDB APIs, see :ref:`Query MongoDB <dotnet-mongodb-data-access>`.

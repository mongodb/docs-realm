Overview
--------

{+service+} provides SDKs that help you connect your client apps to the {+service-short+} 
backend. The SDK provides the {+service-short+} functionality needed to 
authenticate users with any of the built-in :ref:`Authentication providers <authentication-providers>`, 
call backend :ref:`functions <functions>`, and directly access a 
:ref:`MongoDB database <mongodb-service>`. 

.. note:: Code Examples

   Each SDK section in the Realm documentation includes code examples for 
   accomplishing the functionality discussed here. Find the platform / language 
   you are working with and look under **Usage Examples**.

The App Client
----------------
The fundamental building block in the SDK is the ``App`` object. It is from this 
object that all other functionality is provided. The ``App`` object is 
:ref:`initialized <dotnet-init-appclient>` with the Realm app ID, which you can 
:ref:`find your Realm app ID <find-your-app-id>` in the Realm UI.

Authentication
--------------
One of the most challenging aspects of client development is implementing a 
robust and secure authentication system. With the {+service-short+} SDKs, however, you 
can use any of the {+service-short+} authentication providers with very minimal backend 
setup or client-side code required. With the authentication APIs, you can 
implement the following functionality:

- Creation of new user accounts
- User log-in and log-out
- Multiple concurrent users
- Linking user accounts from different providers
- Providing custom user data

For more information, see :ref:`Authenticate Users <dotnet-authenticate>`.

Calling Functions
-----------------
Using the {+service-short+} SDKs, you can :ref:`create server-side functions <create-a-function>`, 
which enables you to call the same functionality from multiple client types 
without have to reproduce the logic. Calling functions from your client code is 
then reduced to only a few lines of code. 

For more information on calling functions, see :ref:`Call a Function <dotnet-call-a-function>`.

Accessing MongoDB
-----------------
While many app clients don't require functionality beyond that provided by 
{+service-short+}, the Realm SDKs include the APIs for accessing a MongoDB 
Atlas instance directly. With these APIs, you can perform all of the standard 
CRUD operations from your client. 

For more information on the MongoDB APIs, see :ref:`Query MongoDB <dotnet-mongodb-data-access>`.

Overview
--------

In addition to reading objects, you can **create**, **update** , and **delete**
objects from a realm. Because these operations modify the
state of the realm, we call them "writes", and all writes to Realm 
must be within a **transaction**.

A transaction is a list of read and write operations that
Realm treats as a single indivisible operation. In other
words, a transaction is *all or nothing*: either all of the
operations in the transaction succeed or none of the
operations in the transaction take effect.

**All writes must happen in a transaction.**

A realm allows only one open transaction at a time. Realm
blocks other writes on other threads until the open
transaction is complete. Consequently, there is no race
condition when reading values from the realm within a
transaction.

When you are done with your transaction, Realm either
**commits** it or **cancels** it:

- When Realm **commits** a transaction, Realm writes
  all changes to disk. For synced realms, the SDK queues the change
  for synchronization with Atlas App Services.
- When Realm **cancels** a write transaction or an operation in
  the transaction causes an error, all changes are discarded
  (or "rolled back").

Initiate a Transaction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The .NET SDK provides a simple API you can use for most writes.  The 
:dotnet-sdk:`Write() <reference/Realms.Realm.html#Realms_Realm_Write__1_System_Func___0__>` 
method wraps all commands into a single transaction and then commits the 
transaction. 

The ``Write()`` method is shorthand for using the 
:dotnet-sdk:`BeginWrite() <reference/Realms.Realm.html#Realms_Realm_BeginWrite>` and
:dotnet-sdk:`Transaction.Commit() <reference/Realms.Transaction.html#Realms_Transaction_Commit>`
methods. In most cases, using ``Write()`` will meet your needs, but if you need 
finer control over the transaction, use ``BeginWrite()`` with one of the 
``Transaction`` methods (:dotnet-sdk:`Commit() <reference/Realms.Transaction.html#Realms_Transaction_Commit>`,
:dotnet-sdk:`Dispose() <reference/Realms.Transaction.html#Realms_Transaction_Dispose>`, or 
:dotnet-sdk:`Rollback() <reference/Realms.Transaction.html#Realms_Transaction_Rollback>`). 
The following code shows how to use both approaches:

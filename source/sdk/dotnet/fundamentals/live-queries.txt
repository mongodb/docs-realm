Objects in Realm clients are **live objects** that
update automatically to reflect data changes, including
:ref:`synced <sync>` remote changes, and emit
:ref:`notification events <dotnet-client-notifications>` that you
can subscribe to whenever their underlying data changes. You
can use live objects to work with object-oriented data
natively without an :wikipedia:`ORM
<Object-relational_mapping>` tool.

Live objects are direct proxies to the underlying stored data, which
means that a live object doesn't directly contain data. Instead, a live
object always references the most up-to-date data on disk and
:wikipedia:`lazy loads <Lazy_loading>` property values when you access
them from a :ref:`collection <dotnet-client-collections>`. This means that a
realm can contain many objects but only pay the performance cost for
data that the application is actually using.

Valid write operations on a live object automatically persist to the
realm and propagate to any other synced clients. You do not need to
call an update method, modify the realm, or otherwise "push" updates.

.. _dotnet-read-operations:

Read Operations
---------------

You can read back the data that you have
:ref:`stored <dotnet-realm-database-writes>` in :term:`Realm Database`.
The standard data access pattern across Realm
SDKs is to find, filter, and sort objects, in that order. To
get the best performance from Realm as your app grows and
your queries become more complex, design your app's data
access patterns around a solid understanding of Realm Database
:ref:`read characteristics <dotnet-realm-read-characteristics>`.

.. _dotnet-realm-read-characteristics:

Read Characteristics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you design your app's data access patterns around the
following three key characteristics of reads in Realm Database,
you can be confident you are reading data as
efficiently as possible.

.. _dotnet-results-are-not-copies:

Results Are Not Copies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Results to a query are not copies of your data: modifying
the results of a query will modify the data on disk
directly. This memory mapping also means that results are
**live**: that is, they always reflect the current state on
disk.

See also: :ref:`Collections are Live <dotnet-live-collections>`.

.. _dotnet-results-are-lazy:

Results Are Lazy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Realm Database defers execution of a query until you access the
results. You can chain several filter and sort operations
without requiring extra work to process the intermediate
state.

See also: :ref:`Results are Lazily Evaluated
<dotnet-lazy-evaluated-results>`.

.. _dotnet-references-retained:

References Are Retained
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One benefit of Realm Database's object model is that
Realm Database automatically retains all of an object's
:ref:`relationships <dotnet-client-relationships>` as
direct references, so you can traverse your graph of
relationships directly through the results of a query.

A **direct reference**, or pointer, allows you to access a
related object's properties directly through the reference.

Other databases typically copy objects from database storage
into application memory when you need to work with them
directly. Because application objects contain direct
references, you are left with a choice: copy the object
referred to by each direct reference out of the database in
case it's needed, or just copy the foreign key for each
object and query for the object with that key if it's
accessed. If you choose to copy referenced objects into
application memory, you can use up a lot of resources for
objects that are never accessed, but if you choose to only
copy the foreign key, referenced object lookups can cause
your application to slow down.

Realm Database bypasses all of this using :term:`zero-copy`
:term:`live objects`. :term:`Realm object` accessors point directly into
database storage using memory mapping, so there is no distinction
between the objects in Realm Database and the results of your query in
application memory. Because of this, you can traverse direct references
across an entire realm from any query result.

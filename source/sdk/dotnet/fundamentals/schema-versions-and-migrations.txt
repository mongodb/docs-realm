Overview
--------
A **migration** transforms an existing realm and its objects from its
current :ref:`Realm Schema version <dotnet-schema-version>` to a newer one.
Application data models typically change over time to accommodate new
requirements and features. Migrations give you the flexibility to
automatically update your existing application data whenever a client
application upgrades to a newer version.

Consider the following example, in which we have a ``RealmObject`` 
called "Person":

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/Migrations.snippet.ro3.cs
   :language: csharp

Suppose we now want to split up the ``FullName`` property into two separate 
properties, ``FirstName`` and ``LastName``:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/Migrations.snippet.ro2.cs
   :language: csharp
   
At this point, there is a mismatch between the model and any saved data, and 
an exception will be thrown when you try to open the realm.

Schema Version
--------------

The **schema version** identifies the state of a :ref:`Realm Schema
<dotnet-realm-schema>` at some point in time. Realm Database tracks the schema
version of each realm and uses it to map the objects in each realm
to the correct schema.

Schema versions are integers that you may include
in the realm configuration when you open a realm. If a client
application does not specify a version number when it opens a realm then
the realm defaults to version ``0``.

.. important:: Increment Versions Monotonically

   Migrations must update a realm to a
   higher schema version. Realm Database will throw an error if a client
   application opens a realm with a schema version that is lower than
   the realm's current version or if the specified schema version is the
   same as the realm's current version but includes different
   :ref:`object schemas <dotnet-object-schema>`.

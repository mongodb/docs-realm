To filter data in your realm, use the Realm Database query engine. 

There are two ways to use the query engine with the .NET SDK:

- :ref:`LINQ Syntax <dotnet-linq-syntax>`
- :ref:`Realm Query Language <dotnet-realm-query-language>`

You should use LINQ syntax for
querying when possible, as it aligns with .NET conventions.  

.. note:: About the examples on this page

   The examples in this page use a simple data set for a
   task list app. The two Realm object types are ``Project``
   and ``Task``. A ``Task`` has a name, assignee's name, and
   completed flag. There is also an arbitrary number for
   priority -- higher is more important -- and a count of
   minutes spent working on it. A ``Project`` has zero or more
   ``Tasks``.

   See the schema for these two classes, ``Project`` and
   ``Task``, below:

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/QueryEngineExamples.snippet.classes.cs
      :language: csharp

.. _dotnet-linq-syntax:

LINQ Syntax
-----------

Realm Database's query engine implements standard `LINQ
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/introduction-to-linq-queries>`__
syntax.
See the scope of LINQ implemented on the `LINQ
Support page <https://realm.io/docs/dotnet/latest/api/linqsupport.html>`__.

There are several operators available to filter a
:ref:`Realm collection <dotnet-client-collections>` with LINQ.
Filters work by evaluating an operator expression for
every object in the collection being
filtered. If the expression resolves to ``true``, realm
includes the object in the results collection.

An expression consists of one of the following:

- The name of a property of the object currently being evaluated
- An operator
- A value of any type used by realm (string, date, number, boolean, etc.)

Comparison Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Value comparisons

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - | ``==``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand expression is equal to the 
       right-hand expression.

   * - | ``>``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand numerical or date expression is 
       greater than the right-hand numerical or date expression. For dates, this 
       evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand date is later than the right-hand 
       date.

   * - | ``>=``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand numerical or date expression is 
       greater than or equal to the right-hand numerical or date expression. For 
       dates, this evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand date is later than or 
       the same as the right-hand date.

   * - | ``<``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand numerical or date expression is 
       less than the right-hand numerical or date expression. For dates, this 
       evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand date is earlier than the 
       right-hand date.

   * - | ``<=``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand numeric expression is less than 
       or equal to the right-hand numeric expression. For dates, this evaluates 
       to ``true`` if the left-hand date is earlier than or the same as the 
       right-hand date.

   * - | ``!=``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand expression is not equal to the 
       right-hand expression.

.. example::

   The following example uses the query engine's
   comparison operators to:

   - Find high priority tasks by comparing the value of the ``priority`` property 
     value with a threshold number, above which priority can be considered high.
   - Find just-started or short-running tasks by seeing if the ``progressMinutes`` 
     property falls within a certain range.
   - Find unassigned tasks by finding tasks where the ``assignee`` property is 
     equal to ``null``.
   - Find tasks assigned to specific teammates Ali or Jamie by seeing if the 
     ``assignee`` property is in a list of names.

Logical Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the logical operators listed in the following table to make compound 
predicates:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - | ``&&``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if both left-hand and right-hand expressions are 
       ``true``.

   * - | ``!``
     - Negates the result of the given expression.

   * - | ``||``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if either expression returns ``true``.

.. example::

   We can use the query language's logical operators to find
   all of Ali's completed tasks. That is, we find all tasks
   where the ``assignee`` property value is equal to 'Ali' AND
   the ``isComplete`` property value is ``true``:

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/QueryEngineExamples.snippet.logical.cs
      :language: csharp


String Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can compare string values using the string operators listed in the following 
table. Regex-like wildcards allow more flexibility in search.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 60

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - ``StartsWith``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string expression begins with the 
       right-hand string expression. This is similar to ``contains``, but only 
       matches if the left-hand string expression is found at the beginning of 
       the right-hand string expression.

   * - | ``EndsWith``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string expression ends with the 
       right-hand string expression. This is similar to ``contains``, but only 
       matches if the left-hand string expression is found at the very end of 
       the right-hand string expression.

   * - | ``Like``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string expression
       matches the right-hand string wildcard string
       expression. A wildcard string expression is a string
       that uses normal characters with two special wildcard
       characters:

       - The ``*`` wildcard matches zero or more of any character
       - The ``?`` wildcard matches any character.

       For example, the wildcard string "d?g" matches "dog",
       "dig", and "dug", but not "ding", "dg", or "a dog".

   * - | ``Equals``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string is 
       `lexicographically <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_order>`_ 
       equal to the right-hand string.

   * - | ``Contains``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string expression is found anywhere 
       in the right-hand string expression.

   * - | ``string.IsNullOrEmpty``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string expression is null or empty.
       Note that ``IsNullOrEmpty()`` is a static method on ``string``. 

.. example::

   The following examples use the query engine's string operators to find
   tasks:

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/QueryEngineExamples.snippet.strings.cs
      :language: csharp

.. important:: Case Comparisons

   When evaluating strings, the second parameter in all functions *except* ``Like`` 
   must be either ``StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase`` or 
   ``StringComparison.Ordinal``. For the ``Like()`` method, the second 
   parameter is a boolean value (where "true" means "case sensitive").

.. _dotnet-realm-query-language:

Realm Query Language
--------------------

You can also use :dotnet-sdk:`Filter() <reference/Realms.CollectionExtensions.html?q=Filter>`
to query realms using :ref:`Realm Query Language <realm-query-language>`.
Realm Query Language is a string-based query language to access the query engine.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/QueryEngineExamples.snippet.rql.cs
    :language: csharp

You should use :ref:`.NET LINQ syntax <dotnet-linq-syntax>` for queries,
unless your requirements extend beyond LINQ's current capabilities.
Realm Query Language is able to perform operations that LINQ syntax is not,
such as :ref:`aggregation <dotnet-realm-query-language-aggregation>`.

.. include:: /includes/tip-realm-query-language-reference-examples.rst

.. _dotnet-realm-query-language-aggregation:

Aggregate Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Aggregate operators traverse a
:ref:`collection <dotnet-client-collections>` and reduce it
to a single value. Note that aggregations use the 
:dotnet-sdk:`Filter() <reference/Realms.CollectionExtensions.html?q=Filter>` 
method, which can be used to create more complex queries that are currently 
unsupported by the LINQ provider. ``Filter()`` supports SORT and DISTINCT 
clauses in addition to filtering.

For more information on the available aggregate operators, refer to the 
:ref:`Realm Query Language aggregate operator reference <rql-aggregate-operators>`.

The following examples show different ways to aggregate data:

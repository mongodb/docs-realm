A **realm** is a set of related objects that conform to a pre-defined
schema. Realms may contain more than one type of data as long as a 
schema exists for each type.

Every realm stores data in a separate realm file that contains a binary
encoding of each object in the realm. You can automatically :ref:`synchronize
a realm across multiple devices <sync>` and set up :ref:`reactive event handlers
<dotnet-client-notifications>` that call a function any time an object in a realm is
created, modified, or deleted.

Comparison with Other Databases
-------------------------------

The Realm data model is similar to both relational and document
databases but has distinct differences from both. To underscore these
differences, it's helpful to highlight what a realm **is not**:

A realm is not a single, application-wide database.
    Unlike other applications, which store all of their data in a single database,
    Apps often split data across multiple realms to organize data more efficiently
    and to enforce access controls.

A realm is not a table.
    Tables typically only store one kind of information, such as street
    addresses or items in a store inventory, whereas a realm can contain
    any number of object types.

A realm is not a collection of schemaless documents.
    Application objects are similar to documents, but every object in a
    realm conforms to a defined schema for its object type. An object
    cannot contain a field that is not described by its schema.

Key Concepts
------------

.. _dotnet-realm-path:

Synced Realms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using Device Sync, each realm corresponds to a subset of the data in your
App's synced Atlas cluster. 

When you use :ref:`Partition-Based Sync <partition-based-sync>`, synced 
realms represent partitions of Atlas data. You can customize the 
:ref:`partitioning <sync-partitions>` of data using your application's
:ref:`partition key <partition-key>`. Unique values of the partition
key, known as :ref:`partition values <partition-value>`, correspond to
individual realms.

When you use :ref:`Flexible Sync <flexible-sync>`, you can customize the 
data your client application syncs by subscribing to queries. These queries 
search for data in your App backend, and the Flexible Sync realm syncs 
data that matches the queries. The client application can only sync data 
where the user has the appropriate :ref:`read or read and write permissions 
<flexible-sync-rules-and-permissions>` to access the data.

You can customize permissions for the data that synced realms can read
and write from your App when you configure 
:ref:`Realm Rules <sync-rules>`.

.. _dotnet-realm-schema:

Realm Schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **Realm Schema** is a list of valid :ref:`object schemas <dotnet-objects>` that
each define an object type that an App may persist. All objects in a realm must
conform to the Realm Schema.

Client applications provide an Object Schema when they open a realm. If a
realm already contains data, then it already has a schema, and when it is opened, 
Realm Database validates the schema on the client against the existing schema.

To define the schema, you can specify the 
:dotnet-sdk:`Schema <reference/Realms.RealmConfigurationBase.html#Realms_RealmConfigurationBase_Schema>` 
property on the 
:dotnet-sdk:`RealmConfiguration <reference/Realms.RealmConfiguration.html>`. If 
you omit this property, then all classes that inherit from 
:dotnet-sdk:`RealmObject <reference/Realms.RealmObject.html>` or 
:dotnet-sdk:`EmbeddedObject <reference/Realms.EmbeddedObject.html>` are added 
to the schema automatically.

.. _dotnet-realm-file:

Realm Files 
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Realm Database stores a binary encoded version of every object and type in a
realm in a single ``.realm`` file. The file is located at the path that
you define in the 
:dotnet-sdk:`RealmConfiguration <reference/Realms.RealmConfiguration.html#Realms_RealmConfiguration__ctor_System_String_>` 
object when you open the realm, or in the default path if you do not 
specify a path.

The default realm file is named ``default.realm`` and is located where the OS 
stores app-specific data.

.. tip:: Implement Compacting in Your Production Application

   Every production application should implement :dotnet-sdk:`ShouldCompactOnLaunch 
   <reference/Realms.RealmConfiguration.html#Realms_RealmConfiguration_ShouldCompactOnLaunch>` 
   to periodically reduce the realm file size. For more information
   about compacting a realm, see: :ref:`<dotnet-compact-realm>`.

.. note:: Auxiliary Realm Files
   
   Realm Database creates additional files for each realm.
   To learn more about these files, see :ref:`Realm Database Internals
   <dotnet-realm-database>`.


Deleting a Realm File
`````````````````````
In some circumstances, such as a :ref:`client reset <dotnet-client-resets>` 
scenario, you might need to delete a realm file and its auxiliary files. If 
you are developing or debugging the app, you might manually delete the realm 
file, but doing so when the app is running and any realm instances are still 
open can cause data corruption. 

To delete a realm file while the app is running, you can use the 
:dotnet-sdk:`DeleteRealm(configuration) <reference/Realms.Realm.html#Realms_Realm_DeleteRealm_Realms_RealmConfigurationBase_>` 
method to safely do so. The following code demonstrates this:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/Program.snippet.delete-realm-file.cs
   :language: csharp

.. warning:: Use Caution When Deleting Realm Files
   
   If you delete a realm file or any of its auxiliary files while one or
   more instances of the realm are open, you might corrupt the realm or
   disrupt :ref:`sync <sync>`.
   
   You may delete these files when all instances of a realm are
   closed. Before you delete a realm file, however, **be sure that you back up any
   important objects as you will lose all unsynced data in the realm**.


Summary
-------

- A realm is a collection of objects that conform to a
  schema. It is not a single, application-wide database. There can and
  usually will be more than one realm per application.

- When using :ref:`Partition-Based Sync <partition-based-sync>`, a 
  partition value is a realm's unique identifier.

- Realm Rules define who can read or write the realm and apply to the realm as a whole.

- A Realm Schema is a specification of the object types used in an App.

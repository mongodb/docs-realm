Read a User's Metadata
----------------------

You can read the :ref:`user metadata <user-metadata>` of a
currently logged-in user through the :dotnet-sdk:`User <reference/Realms.Sync.User.html>` 
object. You cannot edit user metadata through a ``User`` object. 

The ``Profile`` property on the ``User`` object returns a 
:dotnet-sdk:`UserProfile <reference/Realms.Sync.UserProfile.html>` object
of a logged-in user. The following example shows how to get a user's email from 
the metatdata:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/UserLinkExamples.snippet.user-metadata.cs
   :language: csharp

User metadata options vary depending on which provider you're using and
:ref:`which metadata fields you enable <configure-user-metadata-on-the-backend>`. 

.. warning:: User Metadata May Be Stale
   
   Atlas App Services fetches the most recent version of user metadata when a user
   logs in. If the user changes their email address or profile photo with a 
   login provider, for example, those changes do not update in user metadata 
   until the user logs in again. Because we cache credentials and enable you 
   to bypass the login flow, user metadata may become stale unless you 
   force the user to log in again.


.. _dotnet-configure-user-metadata:

Update User Metadata
--------------------

User metadata is read-only data. You cannot update or edit it. If you want 
to create editable user data, use :ref:`custom user data <custom-user-data>`  
instead.

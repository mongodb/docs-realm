.. note::

   Notifications only work when your realm regularly refreshes.
   In the Main or UI thread of your application, realm refreshes
   happen automatically.
   On background threads, you need to handle this
   yourself by either calling :dotnet-sdk:`Realm.Refresh()
   <reference/Realms.Realm.html#Realms_Realm_Refresh>` or installing a
   `SynchronizationContext
   <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.synchronizationcontext>`__
   on the thread before opening the realm. The third-party library
   `Nito.AsyncEx.Context <https://www.nuget.org/packages/Nito.AsyncEx.Context/1.1.0>`__
   provides a ``SynchronizationContext`` implementation and a convenient API to 
   install it.

Any modern app should be able to react when data changes,
regardless of where that change originated. When a user adds
a new item to a list, you may want to update the UI, show a
notification, or log a message. When someone updates that
item, you may want to change its visual state or fire off a
network request. Finally, when someone deletes the item, you
probably want to remove it from the UI. Realm's notification
system allows you to watch for and react to changes in your
data, independent of the writes that caused the changes.

Realm emits three kinds of notifications:

- :ref:`Realm notifications <dotnet-realm-notifications>` whenever a specific 
  Realm commits a write transaction.
- :ref:`Collection notifications <dotnet-collection-notifications>` whenever 
  any Realm object in a collection changes, including inserts, updates, and deletes.
- :ref:`Object notifications <dotnet-object-notifications>` whenever a specific 
  Realm object changes.

.. _dotnet-subscribe-to-changes:

Subscribe to Changes
--------------------

Generally, to observe changes, you create a 
notification handler for the Realm, collection, or object that you want to watch. 

.. _dotnet-register-a-realm-change-listener:
.. _dotnet-realm-notifications:

Register a Realm Change Listener
--------------------------------
You can register a notification handler on an entire Realm.
Realm Database invokes the notification handler whenever any write
transaction involving that Realm is committed. The
handler receives no information about the change.

This is useful when you want to know that there has been a
change but do not care to know specifically what changed.
For example, proof of concept apps often use this
notification type and simply refresh the entire UI when
anything changes. As the app becomes more sophisticated and
performance-sensitive, the app developers shift to more
granular notifications.

.. example::

  Suppose you are writing a real-time collaborative app. To
  give the sense that your app is buzzing with collaborative
  activity, you want to have an indicator that lights up when
  any change is made. In that case, a realm notification
  handler would be a great way to drive the code that controls
  the indicator.

.. _dotnet-register-a-collection-change-listener:
.. _dotnet-collection-notifications:

Register a Collection Change Listener
-------------------------------------

You can register a notification handler on a specific
collection within a Realm. The handler receives a
description of changes since the last notification.
Specifically, this description consists of three lists of
indices:

- The indices of the objects that were deleted.
- The indices of the objects that were inserted.
- The indices of the objects that were modified.

.. important:: Order Matters
   
   In collection notification handlers, always apply changes
   in the following order: deletions, insertions, then
   modifications. Handling insertions before deletions may
   result in unexpected behavior.

Realm Database emits an initial notification after retrieving the
collection. After that, Realm Database delivers collection
notifications asynchronously whenever a write transaction
adds, changes, or removes objects in the collection.

Unlike Realm notifications, collection notifications contain
detailed information about the change. This enables
sophisticated and selective reactions to changes. Collection
notifications provide all the information needed to manage a
list or other view that represents the collection in the UI.

.. example::

  The following code shows how to observe a collection for
  changes in order to update the UI. 


  .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/WorkWithRealm.snippet.collection-notifications.cs
     :language: csharp
     :emphasize-lines: 2-3

.. note::

   Every Realm collection implements ``INotifyCollectionChanged``, which allows 
   you to use a collection directly in data-binding scenarios.

.. _dotnet-change-set-cleared:

Check if the ChangeSet Has Been Cleared
```````````````````````````````````````
When you clear a collection by calling ``Clear()`` on an `IList
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.ilist?view=net-6.0>`_
or `ISet
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.iset-1?view=net-6.0>`_
to reset the property, Realm Database raises a ``CollectionChanged`` event with the
action `Reset
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.specialized.notifycollectionchangedaction?view=net-6.0>`_.

Register a change listener on a collection's ``IList`` or ``ISet`` property to
check if that property has been cleared.

.. example::

  In the following example, we register a change listener on ``fido.Owners``,
  which is an ``IList`` of ``Owners`` of a ``Dog`` object.

  .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/WorkWithRealm.snippet.get-notification-if-collection-is-cleared.cs
     :language: csharp

  In the code snippet below, Fido's owner property is cleared, triggering the
  change listener in the code snippet above and the logic in the ``if`` block.

  .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/WorkWithRealm.snippet.clear-collection.cs
     :language: csharp

.. _dotnet-register-an-object-change-listener:
.. _dotnet-object-notifications:

Register an Object Change Listener
----------------------------------

You can register a notification handler on a specific object
within a Realm. Realm Database notifies your handler when any of the object's 
properties change.

The handler receives information about what fields have changed.

.. example::

  The following code shows how to observe a specific object for
  changes.

  .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/WorkWithRealm.snippet.object-notifications.cs
     :language: csharp
     :emphasize-lines: 4

.. _dotnet-unregister-a-change-listener:

Unregister a Change Listener
----------------------------

When you no longer want to receive notifications on an event, you unsubscribe. 
The following code demonstrates this:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/WorkWithRealm.snippet.unsubscribe.cs
   :language: csharp

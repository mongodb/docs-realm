.. _dotnet-og-schema:

The following examples demonstrate how to add, delete, and modify 
properties in a schema. First, make the required schema change. Then,
create a corresponding :ref:`migration function
<dotnet-migration-function>` to move data from the original schema
to the updated schema.

.. include:: /includes/note-modify-schema-properties-of-synced-realms.rst

.. note:: Versions Update on Realm Open

   Assume that each schema change in this example occurs after
   an application has used each version for some amount of time. New
   schema version numbers only apply once you open the realm 
   with an updated schema and explicitly specify the new version
   number, so in order to get to version 3, you would first need to
   open the app with versions 1 and 2.

A realm using schema version ``1`` has a ``Person`` object type:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/Migrations.snippet.ro1.cs
   :language: csharp

.. _dotnet-add-a-property:

Add a Property
--------------

The following example adds a ``LastName`` property to the
:ref:`original Person schema <dotnet-og-schema>`:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/Migrations.snippet.ro2.cs
   :language: csharp
   :emphasize-lines: 8

.. _dotnet-delete-a-property:

Delete a Property
-----------------

The following example uses a combined
``FullName`` property instead of the separate ``FirstName`` and
``LastName`` property in the :ref:`original Person schema <dotnet-og-schema>`:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/Migrations.snippet.ro3.cs
   :language: csharp
   :emphasize-lines: 7

.. _dotnet-modify-a-property-type:
.. _dotnet-rename-a-property:

Modify a Property Type or Rename a Property
-------------------------------------------

The following example modifies the ``Age`` property in the
:ref:`original Person schema <dotnet-og-schema>` by
renaming it to ``Birthday`` and changing the type to ``DateTimeOffset``:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/Migrations.snippet.ro4.cs
   :language: csharp
   :emphasize-lines: 8

.. _dotnet-migration-function:

Migration Functions
-------------------

.. tip:: Bypass Migration During Development

   When developing or debugging your application, you may prefer to delete 
   the realm instead of migrating it. Use the 
   :dotnet-sdk:`ShouldDeleteIfMigrationNeeded <reference/Realms.RealmConfiguration.html#Realms_RealmConfiguration_ShouldDeleteIfMigrationNeeded>` 
   flag to delete the database automatically when a schema mismatch would
   require a migration. 

   Never release an app to production with this flag set to ``true``.

To migrate the realm to conform to the updated ``Person`` schema, the
set the realm's :ref:`schema version <dotnet-schema-version>` to
``4`` and define a migration function to set the value of
``FullName`` based on the existing ``FirstName`` and ``LastName``
properties and the value of ``Birthday`` based on ``Age``:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/Migrations.snippet.migrate.cs
   :language: csharp
   :emphasize-lines: 3, 21, 25, 31

.. note:: Unity does not support the ``dynamic`` keyword when using ``IL2CPP``

   Unity has various `scripting restrictions
   <https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptingRestrictions.html>`_ and does not
   support the `dynamic keyword
   <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/types/using-type-dynamic>`_
   when using `IL2CPP  <https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/IL2CPP.html>`_.
   Instead you can cast the Dynamic value to the type you want to use. In the
   following example, the retrieved ``Person`` objects are explicitly converted to
   an ``IQueryable<RealmObject>``. 

   .. code-block:: csharp

     var oldPeople = (IQueryable<RealmObject>)migration.OldRealm.DynamicApi.All("Person"); // store results of retrieved Person objects

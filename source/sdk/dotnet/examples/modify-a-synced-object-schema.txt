A **synced migration** is a migration for a {+realm+} that
automatically :doc:`{+sync-short+}s </sync>` with
another remote {+realm+}. {+client-database+} automatically handles all
synced schema migrations and does not allow you to specify a
migration function.

Synced {+realms+} represent multiple end users and devices that will likely
not all immediately update to the most recent version of an application.
{+service+} ensures that synced schema changes are backwards compatible,
which means that client applications that have not updated to the most
recent version can still sync with clients that are using the most recent
version.

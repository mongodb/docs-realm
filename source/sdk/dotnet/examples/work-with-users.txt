Overview
--------

When you use {+backend+} to back your client app, you get access to a
:ref:`user object <user-objects>`. You can use the .NET SDK to:

- Create and delete users
- Log users in and out
- Create and update custom user data
- Read user metadata from other login providers

.. _dotnet-creating-and-deleting-users:

Create and Delete Users
-----------------------

For all authentication providers other than email/password authentication,
{+backend+} automatically :ref:`creates a user object <dotnet-create-user>` 
the first time a user authenticates. If a user authenticates via more than 
one method, you can :ref:`link these user identities <dotnet-link-user-identities>` 
to a single user object. 

You can :ref:`delete user objects <dotnet-delete-user>`. Deleting a user object 
deletes metadata attached to the user object, but does not delete user-entered
data from the backend.

.. _dotnet-access-the-app-client:

Log Users In and Out
--------------------

Use one or more :ref:`authentication providers <auth-providers>` to :ref:`log 
users in and out <dotnet-authenticate-users>` of your client app. You can: 

- Log users in with an existing third-party account, such as Apple, Facebook,
  or Google. 
- Create new user accounts with {+backend-short+} email/password management,
  or your own custom function or custom JWT user management.
- Enable anonymous users to let users access your App Services App without 
  persisting user data.

When you have a logged-in user, SDK methods enable you to:

- :ref:`Open a synced {+realm+} <dotnet-login-and-open-realm>` with the user's 
  configuration object
- :ref:`Run a backend function <dotnet-call-a-function>` as the logged-in user
- :ref:`Log the user out <dotnet-logout>`
- :ref:`Change the active user <dotnet-change-the-active-user>` in a multi-user 
  application
- :ref:`Remove a user <dotnet-remove-a-user-from-the-device>` from the device

On successful login, the .NET SDK caches credentials on the device. You 
can bypass the login flow and access the cached user. Use this to open a 
{+realm+} or call a function upon subsequent app opens. 

User Sessions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Atlas App Services manages sessions with access tokens and refresh tokens.
Client SDKs supply the logic to manage tokens, and provide them with requests.

.. _dotnet-app-work-with-custom-user-data:

Read and Update Custom User Data
--------------------------------

You can :ref:`associate custom data <custom-user-data>` with a user object, 
such as a preferred language or local timezone, and read it from your client 
application. A user object has a ``customData`` property that you can use 
to :ref:`access custom user data <dotnet-read-a-users-custom-data>`. 

To :ref:`create <dotnet-create-a-users-custom-data-document>` and :ref:`update 
<dotnet-update-a-users-custom-data>` custom user data, you must access 
your MongoDB data source directly. {+backend-short+} does not offer a SDK 
method to create or update this custom user data; it's a read-only property.

.. _dotnet-app-read-user-metadata-from-login-providers:

Read User Metadata from Login Providers
---------------------------------------

Some authentication providers enable developers to access user metadata, such
as full name or email address. When you configure these metadata fields on 
the {+backend+} application, you can read this medata from your client app. A
user object has a ``profile`` property that you can use to :ref:`access 
user metadata <dotnet-read-user-metadata>`.

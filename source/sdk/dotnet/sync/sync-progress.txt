You may want to know the status of Sync operations in your app. For 
example, you might want specific code to run only after all of the data is 
synced with App Services.

You can set up your Sync session to wait for changes to be uploaded 
or downloaded. You can also configure your Sync session to
notify when the Sync connection status changes.

.. _dotnet-check-sync-progress-wait-for-upload-or-download:

Wait for Changes to be Uploaded or Downloaded
---------------------------------------------

To asynchronously wait for your changes to be completed, get the sync session 
from the :dotnet-sdk:`Realms.Sync.SyncSession
<reference/Realms.Realm.html#Realms_Realm_SyncSession>`
property, and then call the :dotnet-sdk:`session.WaitForUploadAsync()
<reference/Realms.Sync.Session.html#Realms_Sync_Session_WaitForUploadAsync>` or 
:dotnet-sdk:`session.WaitForDownloadAsync()
<reference/Realms.Sync.Session.html#Realms_Sync_Session_WaitForDownloadAsync>` 
methods. For example:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/ProgressNotifications.snippet.wait-for-changes-to-download-async-progress-notification.cs
   :language: csharp

Get Connection State Changes
----------------------------

To get the connection state of a :dotnet-sdk:`SyncSession
<reference/Realms.Realm.html#Realms_Realm_SyncSession>`, set an event handler
on the :dotnet-sdk:`PropertyChanged <reference/Realms.Sync.Session.html#Realms_Sync_Session_PropertyChanged>`
event. The event handler is a standard
`.NET PropertyChangedEventHandler delegate
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.componentmodel.propertychangedeventhandler?view=net-6.0>`_
that takes in a ``sender`` object and
`PropertyChangedEventArgs <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.componentmodel.propertychangedeventargs?view=net-6.0>`_
object. 
In the event handler, cast the sender to a ``Session`` object and check if 
the event argument's ``PropertyName`` property is ``Session.ConnectionState``. 
You can then get the
:dotnet-sdk:`ConnectionState <reference/Realms.Sync.Session.html#Realms_Sync_Session_ConnectionState>`
value, which will be one of the following:

- Connecting
- Connected
- Disconnected

The following code demonstrates setting the event handler, casting the session
object, and checking the Sync status:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/ProgressNotifications.snippet.connection-state.cs
   :language: csharp

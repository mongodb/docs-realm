Overview
--------

Updates behave the same as other writes (like creating a new document).
When updating documents, all writes must happen in a 
transaction.

.. example::

   The following code shows how to run a transaction with
   the realm's write method. If the code in the callback
   throws an exception, Realm Database cancels the transaction.
   Otherwise, Realm Database commits the transaction.

Modify an Object
----------------

.. example::

   This code changes the dog's name to "Wolfie" and
   increments the age by 1:

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/CRUD/Update.cs
      :language: csharp

.. _dotnet-upsert:

Upsert an Object
----------------

.. example::

   This code demonstrates how to upsert an object with
   realm. We create a new user named "Drew" and then update
   their name to "Andy" via upsert:

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/CRUD/Upsert.cs
      :language: csharp

.. _dotnet-batch-update:

Update a Collection
-------------------

.. example::

   The following code demonstrates how to update a
   collection. Thanks to the :ref:`implicit inverse
   relationship <dotnet-inverse-relationship>` between the
   Dog's ``owner`` property and the Person's ``dogs``
   property, Realm Database automatically updates Ali's
   list of dogs.

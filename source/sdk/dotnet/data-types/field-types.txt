Overview
--------

The .Net SDK supports three categories of data types:

- :ref:`.Net types <dotnet-dotnettypes>`
- :ref:`MongoDB.Bson types <dotnet-bsontypes>`
- :ref:`Realm-Specific Types <dotnet-realmtypes>`

.. _dotnet-dotnettypes:

.NET Types
----------
{+client-database+} supports the following .NET data types and their 
nullable counterparts:

- ``bool``
- ``byte``
- ``short``
- ``int``
- ``long``
- ``float``
- ``double``
- ``decimal``
- ``char``
- ``string``
- ``byte[]``
- ``DateTimeOffset``
- ``Guid``
- ``IList<T>``, where T is any of the supported data types 
  (see :ref:`Lists <dotnet-property-lists>`)

.. note::

   The ``byte``, ``char``, ``short``, ``int``, and ``long`` types  are all stored 
   as 64 bit integer values within {+client-database+}. 

.. _dotnet-bsontypes:

MongoDB.Bson Types
------------------

- ``ObjectId`` 
- ``Decimal128``

Guid and ObjectId Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``MongoDB.Bson.ObjectId`` is a MongoDB-specific 12-byte unique value, while the 
built-in .NET type ``Guid`` is a 16-byte universally-unique value. Both types are 
:ref:`indexable <dotnet-index-field>`, and either can be used as a 
:ref:`Primary Key <dotnet-primary-key>`.

.. _dotnet-decimal128:

Using Decimal Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Realm supports 128-bit decimal values with the ``Decimal128`` Bson type. When 
defining a decimal type, you can use the ``Decimal128`` Bson type or the .NET 
``decimal`` type, even though it is only a 96-bit decimal. The SDK automatically 
converts between the two, although you risk losing precision or range. The 
following example shows how to use both the ``Decimal128`` Bson type and the .NET 
``decimal`` type:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/DecimalFun.codeblock.decimal128.cs
   :language: csharp

.. _dotnet-realmtypes:

Realm-Specific Types
--------------------
- ``RealmInteger<T>``
- ``RealmValue``
- A ``RealmObject`` subclass 
- An ``EmbeddedObject`` subclass (see :ref:`Embedded Objects <dotnet-property-embedded>`)

.. _realminteger:

RealmInteger
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Realm offers 
:dotnet-sdk:`RealmInteger<T> <reference/Realms.RealmInteger-1.html>` as a 
special integer type to be used as a logical counter. ``RealmInteger<T>`` 
exposes an additional API that can more clearly express intent and generate 
better conflict resolution steps when using Synchronized Realms. The type 
argument ``<T>`` can be of type ``byte``, ``short``, ``int``, or ``long``. The 
following example shows how to use a ``RealmInteger`` property that maps to 
an ``int``:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/DataTypes.codeblock.realmint-class.cs
   :language: csharp

Traditionally, you would implement a counter by reading a value, incrementing 
it, and then setting it (``myObject.Counter += 1``). This does not work well in 
an asynchronous situation like when two clients are offline. Consider 
the following scenario:

- The {+realm+} object has a ``counter`` property of type ``int``. It is currently 
  set to a value of ``10``.

- Clients 1 and 2 both read the ``counter`` property (``10``) and each increments 
  the value by ``1``.

- When each client regains connectivity and merges their changes, they expect a 
  value of 11, and there is no conflict. However, the counter value should be 
  ``12``!

When using a ``RealmInteger``, however, you can call the ``Increment()`` and 
``Decrement()`` methods, and to reset the counter, you set it to ``0``, just as 
you would an ``int``:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/DataTypes.codeblock.realmint-use.cs
   :language: csharp

.. important::

   When you reset a ``RealmInteger``, you may run into the offline merge issue 
   described above.

A ``RealmInteger`` is backed by traditional ``integer`` type, so no schema 
migration is required when changing a property type from ``T`` to 
``RealmInteger<T>``.

.. _realmvalue:

RealmValue
~~~~~~~~~~

The ``RealmValue`` data type is a mixed data type, and can represent any 
other valid Realm data type except a collection. You can create collections 
(lists, sets and dictionaries) of type ``RealmValue``, but a ``RealmValue`` itself 
cannot be a collection. 

.. note:: 

   You cannot create a nullable ``RealmValue``. However, if you want a
   ``RealmValue`` property to contain a null value, you can 
   use ``RealmValue.Null``.

The following code demonstrates creating a ``RealmValue`` property in a class 
that inherits from ``RealmObject`` and then setting and getting the value of 
that property:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/DataTypes.codeblock.realmvalue.cs
   :language: csharp

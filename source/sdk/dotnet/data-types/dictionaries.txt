Overview
--------
A {+service-short+} dictionary is an implementation of   
`IDictionary <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.idictionary-2?view=net-5.0>`_ 
that has keys of type ``String`` and supports values of any 
:ref:`{+service-short+} type <dotnet-objects>` except 
:ref:`collections <dotnet-client-collections>`. 
To define a dictionary, use 
a getter-only ``IDictionary<string, TValue>`` property, where ``TValue`` is any 
of the supported types.

A dictionary of objects can contain null objects. Likewise, dictionaries 
of primitive types can also contain null values. If you do not 
want to allow null values in a dictionary, then either use non-nullable types in 
the dictionary declaration (for example, use ``IDictionary<string, double>`` 
instead of ``IDictionary<string, double?>``), or add the 
:ref:`[Required]<dotnet-required-optional-property>` attribute if the dictionary  
contains nullable reference types, such as ``string`` or ``byte[]``.

The following code shows examples of dictionary types:

   :language: csharp

.. note::
   
   You cannot use Linq to query against a {+service-short+} Dictionary. Instead, 
   use a string query. For more information, see 
   :ref:`Data Type Queries <dotnet-data-type-queries>`.

Data Binding
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Like other Realm collections, ``IDictionary`` implements ``INotifyCollectionChanged``, 
so you can use it in data-binding scenarios (for example, when 
:ref:`watching for changes <dotnet-react-to-changes>`).

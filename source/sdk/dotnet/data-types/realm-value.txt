Overview
--------
.. versionadded:: 10.2.0-beta.1

.. include:: /includes/note-beta-feature.rst

The ``RealmValue`` data type is a mixed data type, and can represent any 
other valid Realm data type except a collection. You can create collections 
(lists, sets, and dictionaries) of type ``RealmValue``, but a ``RealmValue`` 
itself cannot be a collection: 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/DataTypes.codeblock.realmValues.cs
   :language: csharp

.. note:: 

   You cannot create a nullable ``RealmValue``. However, if you want a
   ``RealmValue`` property to contain a null value, you can 
   use the special ``RealmValue.Null`` property.

The following code demonstrates creating a ``RealmValue`` property in a class 
that inherits from ``RealmObject`` and then setting and getting the value of 
that property:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/DataTypes.codeblock.realmvalue.cs
   :language: csharp

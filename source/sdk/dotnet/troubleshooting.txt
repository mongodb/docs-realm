Resolve a 'No Properties in Class' Exception
--------------------------------------------

You may see a ``System.InvalidOperationException`` with the message 
“No properties in class, has linker stripped it?”.

There are three known causes of this exception:

- You have no woven RealmObjects, probably because something went wrong 
  with Fody. If this is the case, ``RealmSchema`` throws an exception. See 
  :ref:`fail-to-weave` for details on how to fix this.

- A linker has stripped properties from one or more RealmObjects, and Realm thinks 
  those properties don't exist. This can occur if you have your 
  `Linker Behavior <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/ios/deploy-test/linker?tabs=macos>`_ 
  set to ``Link all assemblies`` but have not used the ``[Preserve(AllMembers = true)]`` 
  attribute on the class declaration. The linker only preserves class members 
  that you have referenced explicitly in the code or marked with the 
  ``[Preserve(AllMembers = true)]`` attribute. This means that if you want to 
  persist a property in {+realm+} and it is not referenced anywhere 
  in your code, the linker may remove it, causing a schema mismatch.

- You are using a code obfuscation tool which is interfering with 
  model name detection. Realm relies on class names to generate the schema, so 
  if a code obfuscation tool has hidden those class names, schema generation 
  fails. To solve this, set your code obfuscation tool to ignore your model classes.

.. _fody-exception:

Fody: 'An Unhandled Exception Occurred'
---------------------------------------
This common build failure is triggered when you have already built a 
project and then add a new ``RealmObject`` sub-class. Choosing to 
:guilabel:`Build` or :guilabel:`Run` your project does not rebuild the project 
thoroughly enough to invoke the Fody Weaver. To fix this, 
choose to :guilabel:`Rebuild` your project.

.. _fail-to-weave:

Fody Weave Exceptions
---------------------

You may see a warning in the build log about classes not having been woven. This 
indicates that the Fody weaving package is not properly installed. Here are some 
things to check:

- First, check that the ``FodyWeavers.xml`` file contains an entry for Realm.

- It is also possible that the installation of Fody has failed. Users have 
  experienced this with Visual Studio 2015 and versions of NuGet Package Manager 
  prior to version 3.2. To diagnose this, use a text editor to check that your 
  ``.csproj`` has a line importing ``Fody.targets``, such as:

  .. code-block:: sh
     :copyable: false

     <Import Project="..\packages\Fody.1.29.3\build\portable-net+sl+win+wpa+wp\Fody.targets"
      Condition="Exists('..\packages\Fody.1.29.3\build\portable-net+sl+win+wpa+wp\Fody.targets')" />

The easiest fix is to upgrade to a later version of NuGet Package Manager. If 
this doesn’t work, there may be a problem with Fody and ``Microsoft.Bcl.Build.targets``. 
Removing the following line from your .csproj file might help:

.. code-block:: sh
     :copyable: false

     <Import Project="..\..\packages\Microsoft.Bcl.Build.1.0.21\build\Microsoft.Bcl.Build.targets" 
      Condition="Exists('..\..\packages\Microsoft.Bcl.Build.1.0.21\build\Microsoft.Bcl.Build.targets')" />


Troubleshooting WriteAsync Issues
----------------------------------

Inside the ``WriteAsync()`` method, we check for a non-null 
``SynchronizationContext.Current`` object to determine if the code executes on 
the UI thread. This check may be inaccurate if you have set ``Current`` in your  
worker threads. If you have set ``SynchronizationContext.Current`` in a 
worker thread, call the ``Write()`` method instead of ``WriteAsync()``.

For more information, see :ref:`Asynchronous Writes <dotnet-async-writes>`.

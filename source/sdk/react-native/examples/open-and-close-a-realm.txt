.. _react-native-flexible-sync-open-realm:

Open a Flexible Synced Realm
----------------------------

To open a {+realm+} using Flexible Sync, call :js-sdk:`Realm.open() <Realm.html#.open>`. 
Pass in a :js-sdk:`Configuration <Realm.html#~Configuration>`
object, which must include the ``sync`` property defining a 
:js-sdk:`SyncConfiguration <Realm.App.Sync.html#~SyncConfiguration>` object. 
In the SyncConfiguration, you must include include a ``user`` and ``flexible:true``.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/flexible-sync.codeblock.open-flexible-sync-realm.js
   :language: javascript

.. important:: Flexible Sync Requires a Subscription

   You can't use a Flexible Sync realm until you add at least one subscription.
   To learn how to add subscriptions, see: :ref:`<react-native-sync-add-subscription>`.

.. _react-native-partition-sync-open-realm:

Open a Partition-Based Synced Realm
-----------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/react-native-open-a-synced-realm.rst

.. warning:: 

   When attempting to synchronize a {+realm+} while not connected to 
   the Internet, you must pass ``Realm.open()`` a :js-sdk:`Configuration <Realm.html#~Configuration>`
   object that contains the ``newRealmFileBehavior`` and ``existingRealmFileBehavior`` properties. If you 
   don't include these properties, ``Realm.open()`` continues trying
   to connect to the server indefinitely without opening. 
   
   For more information about connecting to your synced {+realm+} 
   while offline, see :ref:`Open Immediately with Background Sync <react-native-open-immediately-with-background-sync>`.

.. _react-native-sync-all-data-before-opening:

Sync All Data before Opening
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, {+service-short+} syncs all data from the server before returning. 

.. example:: 

   The following example shows how to open a synced {+realm+} with with a 
   ``SyncConfiguration`` object that uses a predefined
   ``CarSchema`` :doc:`schema </sdk/node/examples/define-a-realm-object-model>`, 
   the currently logged in user, and a partition value of "myPartition".

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/open-and-close-a-realm.codeblock.open-synced-realm-online-with-car-schema.js
      :language: javascript

.. _react-native-open-after-timeout-with-background-sync:

Open After Timeout with Background Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you don't need to sync all data before returning the {+realm+}, configure the
``newRealmFileBehavior`` and ``existingRealmFileBehavior`` properties of your
SyncConfiguration to automatically open the realm after a timeout period elapses. You
can use a single :js-sdk:`OpenRealmBehaviorConfiguration <Realm.App.Sync.html#~OpenRealmBehaviorConfiguration>`
for both ``newRealmFileBehavior`` and ``existingRealmFileBehavior`` 
that contains the following property values:  

- ``type``: "downloadBeforeOpen"
- ``timeOut``: <time in milliseconds>
- ``timeOutBehavior``: "openLocalRealm"

These properties force the ``Realm.open()`` method to return an open {+realm+} after ``timeOut`` milliseconds, or when the {+realm+} has completely downloaded, whichever comes first. 
If the {+realm+} doesn't finish downloading before the timeout, the initial realm sync continues in the background. For example: 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/open-and-close-a-realm.codeblock.open-synced-realm-config.js
  :language: javascript

This configuration is also useful if you're attempting to sync in an environment 
where it's uncertain if the user has an Internet connection.

.. example::
  
  The following example shows opening a synced {+realm+} with a 
  ``Configuration`` object using a predefined ``Car`` :doc:`schema </sdk/node/examples/define-a-realm-object-model>`, 
  the currently logged in user, a partition value of "myPartition", and a 
  :js-sdk:`SyncConfiguration <Realm.App.Sync.html#~SyncConfiguration>`. The SyncConfiguration includes  
  ``existingRealmFileBehavior`` and ``newRealmFileBehavior`` set to allow the user 
  to work with the local {+realm+} if the device doesn't fully sync within the ``timeOut``
  period of 1000 milliseconds.  

  .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/open-and-close-a-realm.codeblock.open-synced-realm-offline-with-car-schema.js
    :language: javascript

.. _react-native-open-immediately-with-background-sync:

Open Immediately with Background Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you want to connect to the {+realm+} immediately and sync data from the server 
in the background, you must use  a :js-sdk:`OpenRealmBehaviorConfiguration
<Realm.App.Sync.html#~OpenRealmBehaviorConfiguration>` that includes the ``newRealmFileBehavior`` and ``existingRealmFileBehavior`` 
properties. This configuration is useful if a user's device is not connected to the Internet or you're not certain if it's 
connected. 

Create a :js-sdk:`OpenRealmBehaviorConfiguration
<Realm.App.Sync.html#~OpenRealmBehaviorConfiguration>` object and set the
``type`` property to a value of "openImmediately". This configuration opens a local {+realm+} 
immediately without attempting to sync with the server. The client continues  
attempting to connect with the server in the background. 

Then create a :js-sdk:`Configuration <Realm.html#~Configuration>` object, which must
include the ``sync`` property defining a :js-sdk:`SyncConfiguration
<Realm.App.Sync.html#~SyncConfiguration>` object. Set this
OpenRealmBehaviorConfiguration object as the value for
the ``newRealmFileBehavior`` and ``existingRealmFileBehavior`` properties of the
``SyncConfiguration``.

      :language: javascript

.. _react-native-open-existing-realm-different-configuration:

Open Existing Realm with Different Configuration
------------------------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 10.14.0

To open an existing realm with a different configuration, pass the new 
:js-sdk:`Configuration <Realm.html#~Configuration>`
to :js-sdk:`Realm.writeCopyTo() <Realm.html#writeCopyTo>`. 
``Realm.writeCopyTo()`` copies the realm's data to a new realm, but adds different configuration options. 
In the output realm's configuration, you *must* specify the ``path``. 
A realm file cannot already exist at that path. 

The configuration change can include modifications to :js-sdk:`SyncConfiguration
<Realm.App.Sync.html#~SyncConfiguration>`: 

- Local realm to synced realm
- Synced Realm to local realm

The configuration change can also include changes to ``encryptionKey`` 
property of the ``Configuration``: 

- Encrypted realm to unencrypted realm
- Unencrypted realm to encrypted realm

.. example:: Convert Local Realm to Synced Realm

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/open-and-close-a-realm.codeblock.open-local-as-synced.js
      :language: javascript
      :emphasize-lines: 15-16

You can also combine changes to configuration. For example, you can open a
local encrypted realm as a synced unencrypted realm or a unencrypted synced realm
as an encrypted synced realm.

.. example:: Convert Synced Encrypted to Local Unencrypted Realm

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/open-and-close-a-realm.codeblock.sync-encrypted-to-local-unencrypted.js
      :language: javascript
      :emphasize-lines: 19-20

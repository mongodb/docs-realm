Open a Synced Realm While Online
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To open a synced {+realm+} while online, call :js-sdk:`Realm.open() <Realm.html#.open>`. 
Pass in a :js-sdk:`Configuration <Realm.html#~Configuration>`
object, which must include the ``sync`` property defining a 
:js-sdk:`SyncConfiguration <Realm.App.Sync.html#~SyncConfiguration>` object. 

Sync All Data Before Returning
``````````````````````````````

The default behavior for {+realm+} is to sync all data from the server before returning. 
In the :js-sdk:`SyncConfiguration <Realm.App.Sync.html#~SyncConfiguration>`, 
you must include include the ``user`` and ``partitionValue``.

.. example:: 

   The following example shows how to open a synced {+realm+} with with a 
   ``SyncConfiguration`` object that uses a predefined
   ``CarSchema`` :doc:`schema </sdk/node/examples/define-a-realm-object-model>`, 
   the currently logged in user, and a partition value of "MyPartition".

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/open-and-close-a-realm.codeblock.open-synced-realm-online-with-car-schema.js
      :language: javascript

.. _react-native-open-synced-realm-config:

Return After Timeout with Background Sync
`````````````````````````````````````````

If you don't need to sync all data before before returning, configure your SyncConfiguration
to include ``newRealmFileBehavior`` and ``existingRealmFileBehavior`` each with
the same :js-sdk:`OpenRealmBehaviorConfiguration <Realm.App.Sync.html#~OpenRealmBehaviorConfiguration>`.  

Set the OpenRealmBehaviorConfiguration to have ``type: 'downloadBeforeOpen'``, 
``timeOut: <time in milliseconds>`` and ``timeOutBehavior: 'openLocalRealm'``.
These properties make ``Realm.open()`` return at the end of the ``timeOut`` period, and open a local {+realm+}. 
Syncing between local data and the server continues in the background. For example: 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/open-and-close-a-realm.codeblock.open-synced-realm-config.js
  :language: javascript

This configuration is also useful if you're attempting to sync in an environment 
where it's uncertain if the user has an Internet connection. The client attempts 
to sync until the end of the the ``timeOut`` period, and then opens the local {+realm+},
even if the it never connects to the server. 

.. example::
  
  The following example shows opening a synced {+realm+} with a 
  ``Configuration`` object using a predefined ``Car`` :doc:`schema </sdk/node/examples/define-a-realm-object-model>`, 
  the currently logged in user, a partition value of "MyPartition", and a 
  :js-sdk:`SyncConfiguration <Realm.App.Sync.html#~SyncConfiguration>`. The SyncConfiguration includes  
  ``existingRealmFileBehavior`` and ``newRealmFileBehavior`` set to allow the user 
  to work with the local {+realm+} if the device is doesn't fully sync within the ``timeOut``
  period of 1000 milliseconds.  

  .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/open-and-close-a-realm.codeblock.open-synced-realm-offline-with-car-schema.js
    :language: javascript

.. warning:: 

   If you are attempting to synchronize a {+realm+} while not connected to 
   the Internet, you must pass ``Realm.open()`` a :js-sdk:`Configuration <Realm.html#~Configuration>`
   object with ``newRealmFileBehavior`` and ``existingRealmFileBehavior``. If you 
   don't include these properties, ``Realm.open()`` continues trying
   to connect to the server indefinitely without opening. 
   
   Refer to the :ref:`Open a Synced Realm While Offline <node-open-a-synced-realm-while-offline>`
   documentation for more information about connecting to your offline {+realm+}. 

.. _react-native-open-a-synced-realm-while-offline:

Open a Synced Realm While Offline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a user's device is not connected to the Internet or you're not certain if it's 
connected, you must use  a a :js-sdk:`OpenRealmBehaviorConfiguration
<Realm.App.Sync.html#~OpenRealmBehaviorConfiguration>` that includes ``newRealmFileBehavior`` and ``existingRealmFileBehavior`` 
properties. 

Create a :js-sdk:`OpenRealmBehaviorConfiguration
<Realm.App.Sync.html#~OpenRealmBehaviorConfiguration>` object and set its
``type`` to ``"openImmediately"``. This configuration opens a local {+realm+} 
immediately without attempting to sync with the server. The client continues  
attempting to connect with the server in the background.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/sync-changes-between-devices.codeblock.sync-changes-between-devices-sync-changes-in-the-background-create-OpenRealmBehaviorObject.js
      :language: javascript

Create a :js-sdk:`Configuration <Realm.html#~Configuration>` object, which must
include the ``sync`` property defining a :js-sdk:`SyncConfiguration
<Realm.App.Sync.html#~SyncConfiguration>` object. Set this
``OpenRealmBehaviorConfiguration`` object as the value for
the ``newRealmFileBehavior`` and ``existingRealmFileBehavior`` fields of the
``SyncConfiguration``. 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/sync-changes-between-devices.codeblock.sync-changes-between-devices-sync-changes-in-the-background-create-config.js
      :language: javascript

Finally,  call :js-sdk:`Realm.open() <Realm.html#.open>`
to open the local {+realm+} and attempt syncing with the server in the background.

Overview
--------

Flexible Sync uses subscriptions and permissions to determine which
data to sync with your {+app+}.

To use Flexible Sync in a React Native client:

- :ref:`Configure Flexible Sync on the backend <enable-flexible-sync>`.
- :ref:`Initialize the app <react-native-quick-start-init-app>`
- :ref:`Authenticate a user <react-native-quick-start-authenticate>` in
  your client project.
- :ref:`Open the synced Realm with a Flexible Sync configuration <react-native-flexible-sync-open-realm>`
- :ref:`Add subscriptions to the client application <react-native-sync-subscribe-to-queryable-fields>`

You can add, update, and remove query subscriptions to determine which data 
syncs to the client device.

.. include:: /includes/note-flexible-sync-prerequisite.rst

.. note:: Realm JS SDK Version Requirement

   In addition to the requirements above, you must use :github:`Realm JS version
   10.12.0 <realm/realm-js/releases>` or greater in order to use Flexible Sync
   in your React Native application.

.. _react-native-sync-subscribe-to-queryable-fields:

Subscribe to Queryable Fields
-----------------------------

When configuring Flexible Sync on the backend, you specify which fields
your client application can query. In the client application, use the 
``Subscriptions`` API to manage a set of subscriptions to specific queries on 
queryable fields.

You can:

- Get a list of all subscriptions
- Add subscriptions
- Check subscription state
- Update a subscription with a new query
- Remove individual subscriptions or all subscriptions of a type

When data matches the subscription and has appropriate permissions, it syncs
between devices and the backend application.

A Realm subscription in JavaScript has:

- A created and updated date 
- A name
- An object type
- A query string 

You can specify a string name for your subscription. If you do not give your
subscription a name, the name is set to :mdn:`null
<Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/null>`.

When you create a subscription, Realm looks for data matching a query on a
specific object type. In your Flexible Sync subscriptions, you can have
subscriptions on several different object types or several queries on the same
object type.

.. example::

  In the following example, queries are created to subscribe to:

  - A filtered list of completed tasks that have taken over 120 ``progressMinutes``
  - A filtered list of completed tasks

  Notice that queries that you subscribe to using Flexible Sync are
  syntactically the same as :ref:`querying a {+realm+} <react-native-read-operations>`
  and that the queries below will create an overlapping result set.

  .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/flexible-sync.snippet.create-queries-to-subscribe-to.js
     :language: javascript

.. important:: Object Links

   You must add both an object and its linked object to the subscription 
   set to see a linked object.
   
   If your subscription results contain an object with a property that links 
   to an object not contained in the results, the link appears to be null.
   There is no way to distinguish whether that property's value is 
   legitimately null, or whether the object it links to exists but is out of
   view of the query subscription.

Get Subscriptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When using a flexible synced realm, you can access a ``SubscriptionSet``, a
collection of subscriptions, through the :js-sdk:`realm.subscriptions <Realm.html#subscriptions>` property.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/flexible-sync.snippet.get-subscriptions.js
    :language: javascript

You can use this ``SubscriptionSet`` to add queries to the list of subscriptions and
update existing subscriptions, as shown in the examples below.

.. _react-native-sync-add-subscription:

Add a Query to the List Of Subscriptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Compose queries to add to your Flexible Sync subscriptions using the
:ref:`query engine <react-native-client-query-engine>`:  

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/flexible-sync.snippet.create-queries-to-subscribe-to.js
     :language: javascript

.. important:: Flexible Sync Query Limitations

   You cannot use all queries with Flexible Sync subscriptions. 
   Refer to the :ref:`Flexible Sync RQL Limitations documentation <flexible-sync-rql-limitations>`
   for information on which query types are not supported. 

Add queries to your subscriptions list to sync the query's data. To do so, perform the following: 

#. Create a transaction by passing a callback function to the
   :js-sdk:`SubscriptionSet.update() <Realm.App.Sync.SubscriptionSet.html#update>`
   method of your ``SubscriptionSet``. The callback function provides
   a :js-sdk:`MutableSubscriptionSet <Realm.App.Sync.MutableSubscriptionSet.html>`
   as an argument.
#. Within the callback function, call the 
   :js-sdk:`add() <Realm.App.Sync.MutableSubscriptionSet.html#add>`
   method on the ``MutableSubscriptionSet`` to add a query to the subscription.

The following example shows how to subscribe to the queries created above.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/flexible-sync.snippet.subscribe-to-queryable-fields.js
     :language: javascript
     
The ``add()`` method on the ``MutableSubscriptionSet`` takes a ``query`` and a
:js-sdk:`SubscriptionOptions <Realm.App.Sync.html#.SubscriptionOptions>` object.
The subscription options include:

- a ``name`` string field
- a ``throwOnUpdate`` boolean field.

If ``throwOnUpdate`` is false or undefined, adding a subscription with an
existing name will replace the existing query with the new query. However, if
you set ``throwOnUpdate`` to true, adding a subscription with an existing name
but a different query throws an exception.

.. _react-native-sync-bootstrap-initial-subscriptions:

Bootstrap the Realm with Initial Subscriptions
``````````````````````````````````````````````

.. versionadded:: 10.18.0

You must have at least one subscription before you can read from or write to the
realm. You can bootstrap a realm with an initial subscription set when you open
it with a :js-sdk:`SyncConfiguration <Realm.App.Sync.html#~SyncConfiguration>`
and Flexible Sync enabled. Include the ``initialSubscriptions`` field into the
``SyncConfiguration``. Within the ``initialSubscriptions`` object, add an ``update``
field set to a callback in which you can subscribe to queries to bootstrap your
application with:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/flexible-sync.snippet.create-initial-subscriptions-on-fs-realm.js
   :language: javascript

If your app needs to rerun this initial subscription every time the app starts,
you can pass an additional parameter - ``rerunOnOpen``. This is a bool that 
denotes whether the initial subscription should re-run every time the 
app starts. You might need to do this to re-run dynamic time ranges 
or other queries that require a re-computation of static variables for the 
subscription.

.. example:: 

   In the following example, we don't want users to be overwhelmed by irrelevant tasks,
   so we'll load only tasks due within the previous 7 days and the next 7 days.
   Tasks that were due more than a week ago are no longer relevant, and tasks
   that are due further out than the next week are also not relevant. With
   ``rerunOnOpen`` here, the query dynamically recalculates the relevant 
   objects to sync based on the desired date range every time the app starts.

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/flexible-sync.snippet.rerun-initial-subscriptions-on-open.js
      :emphasize-lines: 32
      :language: javascript

.. _react-native-flexible-sync-wait-for-sync:

Check the Status of Subscriptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can check the subscription state to see if the server has acknowledged the
subscription and the device has downloaded the data locally.

You can use subscription state to:

- Trigger error handling
- Show if the transaction is pending or has completed
- Find out when a subscription set is superseded, and you should obtain a
  new instance of the subscription set to write a subscription change

To the status of subscriptions, log the value of the subscription's
:js-sdk:`state <Realm.App.Sync.SubscriptionSet.html#state>`.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/flexible-sync.snippet.log-subscription-state.js 
    :language: javascript

Update Subscriptions with a New Query
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can update a named subscription with a new query. To update a subscriptions
query, pass the new query and a subscription option with the name of the
subscription that you want to update to the
``MutableSubscriptionSet.add()`` method. Like adding a new subscription,
you must update a subscription within a transaction by calling
``subscriptions.update()`` method.

In the following example, long-running tasks are re-defined to be any tasks that
have taken more than 180 minutes. 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/flexible-sync.snippet.update-subscriptions.js
    :language: javascript

.. note::
 
   Attempting to update a subscription that has the
   ``SubscriptionOptions.throwOnUpdate`` field set to true, throw an exception.

Remove Subscriptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To remove subscriptions from the subscription set, you can:

- Remove a single subscription with the given query
- Remove a single subscription with the given name 
- Remove all subscriptions on a specific type
- Remove all subscriptions

When you remove a subscription query, the server also removes synced data from
the client device.


Remove a Subscription by Query
``````````````````````````````
You can remove a specific subscription by query by executing a transaction on
the subscriptions set. Pass the query to the :js-sdk:`remove()
<Realm.App.Sync.MutableSubscriptionSet.html#remove>` method on the
``MutableSubscriptionSet`` within a transaction.

In the following example, the subscription to tasks with an owner named 'Ben' is
removed from the subscriptions set.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/flexible-sync.snippet.remove-single-subscription.js
    :language: javascript

Remove a Subscription by Name
`````````````````````````````
To remove a specific subscription by name, execute a transaction on the
subscriptions set. Within the transaction, pass the name to the
:js-sdk:`removeByName()
<Realm.App.Sync.MutableSubscriptionSet.html#removeByName>` method on the
``MutableSubscriptionSet``.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/flexible-sync.snippet.remove-subscription-by-name.js
    :language: javascript

Remove a Subscription by Reference
``````````````````````````````````
If you have a reference to a subscription, you can remove that subscription. To
do so, execute a transaction on the subscriptions set. Within the transaction,
pass the reference variable to the :js-sdk:`removeSubscription
<Realm.App.Sync.MutableSubscriptionSet.html#removeSubscription>` method on the
``MutableSubscriptionSet``.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/flexible-sync.snippet.remove-subscription-by-reference.js
    :language: javascript

Remove All Subscriptions on an Object Type
``````````````````````````````````````````
To remove all subscriptions on a specific object type, execute a transaction on
the subscriptions set. Within the transaction, pass the object type as a string
to the :js-sdk:`removeByObjectType
<Realm.App.Sync.MutableSubscriptionSet.html#removeByObjectType>` method on the
``MutableSubscriptionSet``.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/flexible-sync.snippet.remove-all-subscriptions-of-object-type.js
    :language: javascript

Remove All Subscriptions
````````````````````````
To remove all subscriptions from the subscriptions set, execute a transaction on
the subscriptions set. Call the :js-sdk:`removeAll()
<Realm.App.Sync.MutableSubscriptionSet.html#removeAll>` method on the
``MutableSubscriptionSet`` within the transaction

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/flexible-sync.snippet.remove-all-subscriptions.js
    :language: javascript

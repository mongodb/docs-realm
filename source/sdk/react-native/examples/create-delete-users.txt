.. _react-native-create-user:

Create a User
-------------

For most :ref:`authentication methods <authentication-providers>`, Realm 
automatically creates a :ref:`user object <user-objects>` the first time 
a user authenticates. The only exception is email/password authentication. 
When you use email/password authentication, you must :ref:`register 
<react-native-register-new-user>` and :ref:`confirm 
<react-native-complete-confirmation>` a user before the user can 
authenticate to a Realm application.

.. _react-native-delete-user:

Delete a User
-------------

.. versionadded:: 10.13.0

Call your {+app+}'s ``.deleteUser()`` method on a user object to delete 
the user from your Realm application.

.. important:: Deleting All User Data

   Deleting a user only deletes the user object, which may contain associated 
   metadata from the associated auth provider. This does not delete :ref:`custom 
   user data <react-native-access-custom-user-data>` or user-entered data from your 
   application. 
   
   Apple :apple:`requires that you disclose data retention 
   and deletion policies <app-store/review/guidelines/#5.1.1>` to your 
   application customers and give them a way to request user data deletion.
   If you collect additional user data, you must implement your own methods 
   or processes to delete that data.

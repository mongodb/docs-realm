Overview
--------
You can copy your {+service-short+} objects to your component's :reactjs:`state
<docs/state-and-lifecycle.html>`.  However, since {+service-short+} objects are live and
automatically update in response to changes, you must also update the copy of
{+service-short+} objects in state. You can do this by registering a change listener in
your component and updating the state variable when that listener fires.  

.. warning::

   Failing to update copies of {+service-short+} objects leads to your UI being out of date. 

Adding Change Listeners to Functional Components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Declare a state variable for your {+service-short+} objects using the
:reactjs:`useState() <docs/hooks-state.html>` hook. Within a
:reactjs:`useEffect() <docs/hooks-effect.html>` hook, set state to the initial
value of your objects and then declare a change listener on the {+service-short+} objects.

Finally, return an anonymous cleanup function that you can use to remove the
change listener and close the realm. Reactjs will call this cleanup function when
the component unmounts.

Adding Change Listeners to Class Components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In your component's constructor, create a :reactjs:`ref
</refs-and-the-dom.html#creating-refs>` to store your {+realm+} instance. When
the value of the {+realm+} changes, the component will not re-render, as it would
with a state variable. Declare a state variable to store your {+service-short+} objects.

Within your :reactjs:`componentDidMount()
<react-component.html#componentdidmount>` method, set state to the initial value
of your objects and then declare a change listener on the {+service-short+} objects.

Finally, within your :reactjs:`componentWillUnmount()
<react-component.html#componentwillunmount>` method, remove the listener and
close the {+realm+}.

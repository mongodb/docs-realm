Realms are the core data structure used to organize data in Realm Database. At
its core, a realm is a collection of the objects that you use in your
application, called Realm objects, as well as additional metadata that describe
the objects.

.. _react-native-realm-file:

Realm Files
-----------

Realm stores a binary encoded version of every object and type in a
realm in a single ``.realm`` file. The file is located at a specific path that
you define when you open the realm.

.. tip:: Implement Compacting in Your Production Application

   Every production application should implement a ``shouldCompactOnLaunch`` 
   callback to periodically reduce the realm file size.

.. note:: Auxiliary Realm Files
   
   Realm creates additional files for each realm.

.. warning:: Use Caution When Deleting Realm Files
   
   In some circumstances, such as a client reset scenario, you might need to
   delete a realm file and its auxiliary files.
   
   If you delete a realm file or any of its auxiliary files while one or
   more instances of the realm are open, you might corrupt the realm or
   disrupt :ref:`sync <sync>`.
   
   You may safely delete these files when all instances of a realm are
   closed. Before you delete a realm file, make sure that you back up any
   important objects as you will lose all unsynced data in the realm.

.. _react-native-in-memory-realm:

In-Memory Realms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also open a realm entirely in memory, which will not create a ``.realm``
file or its associated auxiliary files. Instead the SDK stores objects in memory
while the realm is open and discards them immediately when all instances are
closed.

Find a Realm File Path
----------------------

The realm file is located at a specific path that you can optionally define 
when you open the realm.

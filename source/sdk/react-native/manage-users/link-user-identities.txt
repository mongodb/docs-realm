Link User Identities - React Native SDK
=======================================

Realm provides :ref:`many authentication providers <authentication-providers>` 
to log users into your app. Each provider creates a unique user identity. 
Realm lets you merge multiple credentials into one user identity.

Example
-------

Consider an application that offers :ref:`anonymous login 
<anonymous-authentication>`. This allows users to explore the app without 
registering. If users like the application, they create permanent 
accounts. They sign up with SSO or email/password authentication. By default, 
this creates a new ``User`` object. The app must link the new 
identity with the original User.

You can link identities using :js-sdk:`User.linkCredentials() <Realm.User.html#linkCredentials>`.
This links authentication providers to a logged-in ``User`` object.

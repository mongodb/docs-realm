Link User Identities - React Native SDK
=======================================

Realm provides :ref:`many authentication providers <authentication-providers>`
to log users into your app. Each provider creates a unique user identity.
Realm lets you merge multiple credentials into one user identity.

You can link identities using :js-sdk:`User.linkCredentials() <Realm.User.html#linkCredentials>`.
This links authentication providers to a logged-in ``User`` object.

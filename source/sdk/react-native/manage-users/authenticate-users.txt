``@realm/react`` has hooks for user authentication. :realm-react-sdk:`useAuth 
<functions/useAuth.html>` and :realm-react-sdk:`useEmailPasswordAuth 
<functions/useEmailPasswordAuth.html>` handle authentication with enabled
authentication providers.

For a quick ``useAuth`` reference, refer to :ref:`useAuth Hook 
<react-native-auth-hook>` on this page. For a quick ``useEmailPasswordAuth``
reference, refer to :ref:`useEmailPasswordAuth Hook 
<react-native-email-pass-hook>` on the Manage Email/Password Users page.

You can also use the Realm.js APIs directly. Instantiate a
:js-sdk:`Credentials <classes/Credentials.html>` object and pass it to
:js-sdk:`App.logIn() <classes/App.html#logIn>` to authenticate and obtain a
:js-sdk:`User <classes/User.html>` object.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you can authenticate a user, you must:

- :ref:`Create an App Services App <create-a-realm-app>`
- Enable one or more :ref:`authentication providers <authentication-providers>`
  in the App.
- :ref:`Install the React Native SDK <react-native-install>`

.. _react-native-configure-authentication:

Configure User Authentication in Client
---------------------------------------

``@realm/react`` has providers and hooks for user authentication. To configure
user authentication:

#. Set up ``@realm/react`` providers.
#. Write a fallback component for ``UserProvider``.

Set up @realm/react Providers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Components wrapped by :realm-react-sdk:`AppProvider <functions/AppProvider.html>`
can access the :realm-react-sdk:`useApp <functions/useApp.html>` and
:realm-react-sdk:`useAuth <functions/useAuth.html>` hooks. These components only
render if ``AppProvider`` successfully connects to your App Services backend.

Components wrapped by :realm-react-sdk:`UserProvider <functions/UserProvider.html>`
can access authenticated users with the :realm-react-sdk:`useUser 
<functions/useUser.html>` hook. These components only render if your app has an
authenticated user

To configure user authentication:

#. Wrap all components that need to access App Services in ``AppProvider``.
#. Inside of ``AppProvider``, wrap all components that you want to have access
   to an authenticated user with ``UserProvider``.
#. In ``UserProvider``, include a ``fallback`` prop with a component
   that logs a user in. The app renders this component if there
   is no authenticated user.

.. include:: /examples/generated/react-native/v12/RealmWrapper.snippet.configure-user-provider.tsx.rst

Write a Fallback Component for UserProvider
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your app doesn't have an authenticated and logged-in user, ``UserProvider``
and its children will not render. To handle this case, you can pass a fallback
component to ``UserProvider``. This is commonly the login screen for apps.

The following example uses anonymous authentication, but you could use any of
the ``useAuth`` methods.

To write an authentication fallback component for ``UserProvider``:

#. Create a functional component.
#. Destructure ``logInWithAnonymous`` and ``result`` from the ``useAuth`` hook.
#. Call ``logInWithAnonymous()`` within a ``useEffect`` block that has an empty
   dependency array.
#. Handle ``result``. If the authentication operation doesn't succeed, you can
   write error handling based on ``result``.

.. include:: /examples/generated/react-native/v12/Login.snippet.user-provider-fallback.tsx.rst

User Sessions
-------------

The React Native SDK communicates with Atlas App Services to manage sessions
with access tokens and refresh tokens.

To learn more about session management, refer to  :ref:`<user-sessions>`
in the App Services documentation.

.. _react-native-anonymous-login:
.. _react-native-login-anonymous:

Authentication Providers and Client Authentication
--------------------------------------------------

After you configure user authentication in your client and authentication
providers in your App Services App, you can log users in.

Anonymous User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`Anonymous <anonymous-authentication>` provider allows users to log in
to your application with temporary accounts that have no associated information.

Calling any log in method when a user is currently logged in, switches the 
current user to the new user.

If you call ``logInWithAnonymous()`` in the fallback of the ``UserProvider``,
then ``UserProvider``'s children render as soon as the anonymous log in succeeds.

To log in an anonymous user:

#. Destructure ``logInWithAnonymous`` and ``result`` from the ``useAuth`` hook.
#. Call ``logInWithAnonymous()`` without any arguments.
#. Handle the ``result``.

.. include:: /examples/generated/react-native/v12/LoginWithAnonymous.snippet.login-anonymous.tsx.rst

.. _react-native-email-password-login:
.. _react-native-login-email-password:

Email/Password User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`email/password <email-password-authentication>` authentication
provider allows users to log in to your application with an email address and a
password.

You can use the ``useEmailPasswordAuth`` hook to handle user log in in your
client. For a quick ``useEmailPasswordAuth`` reference, refer to
:ref:`useEmailPasswordAuth Hook <react-native-email-pass-hook>` on the Manage
Email/Password Users page.

To log a user in with email and password:

#. Destructure ``logIn`` and ``result`` from the ``useEmailPasswordAuth`` hook.
#. Pass the user's email and password to ``LogIn()`` as an object.
#. Handle the ``result``.

.. include:: /examples/generated/react-native/v12/LoginWithEmail.snippet.email-password-login.tsx.rst

.. _react-native-api-key-login:
.. _react-native-login-api-key:

API Key User
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`API key <api-key-authentication>` authentication provider allows
server processes to access your app directly or on behalf of a user.

To log in with an API key, create an API Key credential with a server or user
API key and pass it to ``App.logIn()``:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/authenticate.snippet.server-api-key-login.js
   :language: javascript

.. _react-native-custom-jwt-login:
.. _react-native-login-custom-jwt:

Custom JWT User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`Custom JWT <custom-jwt-authentication>` authentication provider
handles user authentication with any authentication system that returns a
:ref:`JSON web token <json-web-tokens>`.

To log in a custom JWT user:

#. Set up the JWT authentication provider in your App Services backend.
#. Get a JWT from an external system.
#. Destructure ``logInWithJWT`` and ``result`` from the ``useAuth`` hook.
#. Pass the JWT to ``logInWithJWT()``.
#. Handle the ``result``.

.. include:: /examples/generated/react-native/v12/LoginWithJwt.snippet.login-jwt.tsx.rst

.. _react-native-custom-function-login:
.. _react-native-login-custom-function:

Custom Function User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Custom Function authentication
provider allows you to handle user authentication by running a :ref:`function
<functions>` that receives a payload of arbitrary information about a user. Refer
to :ref:`Custom Function Authentication <custom-function-authentication>` for
details.

To log in a user with the custom function provider:

#. Create an App Services function to handle your authentication needs.
#. Enable the Custom Function Provider for your App Services App and configure
   it to use the function you created earlier.
#. Destructure ``logInWithFunction`` and ``result`` from the ``useAuth`` hook.
#. Pass any relevant user data (like a username) to ``logInWithFunction()``.
#. Handle the ``result``.

.. include:: examples/generated/react-native/v12/LoginWithFunction.snippet.login-function.tsx.rst

.. _react-native-facebook-login:
.. _react-native-login-facebook:

Facebook User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`Facebook <facebook-authentication>` authentication provider allows
you to authenticate users through a Facebook app using their existing Facebook
account.

To log a user in with their existing Facebook account, you must configure and
enable the :ref:`Facebook authentication provider <facebook-authentication>`
for your App Services App.

.. include:: /includes/note-facebook-profile-picture-url.rst

You can use the :facebook:`official Facebook SDK <docs/facebook-login/overview>`
to handle the user authentication and redirect flow from a client application.
Once authenticated, the Facebook SDK returns an access token that you can send
to your React Native app and use to finish logging the user in to your app.

.. code-block:: javascript

   // Get the access token from a client application using the Facebook SDK
   const accessToken = getFacebookAccessToken();

   // Log the user in to your app
   const credentials = Realm.Credentials.facebook(accessToken);
   app.logIn(credentials).then(user => {
   console.log(`Logged in with id: ${user.id}`);
   });

.. _react-native-google-login:
.. _react-native-login-google:

Google User
~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`Google <google-authentication>` authentication provider allows you to
authenticate users with their existing Google account.

To authenticate a Google user, you must configure the :ref:`Google
authentication provider <google-authentication>` for your App Services App.

There is no official Sign in with Google integration with React Native. The simplest
approach to integrating Sign in With Google into your React Native app
with Realm authentication is to use a third-party library.
The below example uses the library
:github:`React Native Google Sign In <react-native-google-signin/google-signin>`.
You can also build your own solution using :google:`Google Identity Services <identity>` to handle the user
authentication and redirect flow from a client application.

Regardless of implementation, you must retrieve an ID token from the Google Authorization server.
Use that ID token to log into Realm.

.. code-block:: javascript

   // Get the Google OAuth 2.0 access token
   const idToken = getGoogleAccessToken();

   // Log the user in to your app
   const credentials = Realm.Credentials.google({ idToken });
   app.logIn(credentials).then((user) => {
      console.log(`Logged in with id: ${user.id}`);
   });

.. _example-auth-google-react-native:

.. example:: Authenticate with Google in React Native

   This example uses the library
   :github:`React Native Google Sign In<react-native-google-signin/google-signin>`.
   In addition to the React Native code, you must also set up additional configuration
   in your project's ``ios`` and ``android`` directories to use Sign in with Google.
   Refer to the package's documentation for
   :github:`iOS-specific <react-native-google-signin/google-signin/blob/master/docs/ios-guide.md>`
   and :github:`Android-specific <react-native-google-signin/google-signin/blob/master/docs/android-guide.md>`
   documentation.

.. _react-native-apple-login:
.. _react-native-login-apple:

Apple User
~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`Apple <apple-id-authentication>` authentication provider allows you to
authenticate users through Sign-in With Apple.

To authenticate an Apple user, you must configure the :ref:`Apple
authentication provider <apple-id-authentication>` for your App Services App.

You can use the :apple:`official Sign in with Apple JS SDK
<documentation/sign_in_with_apple/sign_in_with_apple_js>` to handle the user
authentication and redirect flow from a client application. Once authenticated,
the Apple JS SDK returns an ID token that you can send to your React Native app and
use to finish logging the user in to your app.

.. code-block:: javascript

   // Get the access token from a client application using the Apple JS SDK
   const idToken = getAppleIdToken();

   // Log the user in to your app
   const credentials = Realm.Credentials.apple(idToken);
   app.logIn(credentials).then(user => {
      console.log(`Logged in with id: ${user.id}`);
   });

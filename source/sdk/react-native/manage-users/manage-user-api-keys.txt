User API keys allow devices or services to communicate with App Services on behalf of a user without sharing
that users credentials. User API keys can be revoked at any time by the authenticated user.
User API keys do not expire on their own.

You can manage a user API key with the :js-sdk:`ApiKeyAuth <Realm.Auth.ApiKeyAuth.html>`
client accessed with an authenticated user's :js-sdk:`User.apiKeys
<Realm.User.html#apiKeys>` property.

If you are using ``@realm/react``, you can access a user's ``ApiKeyAuth`` client
with the ``useUser()`` hook in a component wrapped by ``UserProvider``.

.. _react-native-create-a-user-api-key:

Create a User API Key
---------------------

To create a new :ref:`user API key <api-key-authentication-user-api-key>`, pass
a name that's unique among all of the user's API keys to
:js-sdk:`ApiKeyAuth.create() <Realm.Auth.ApiKeyAuth.html#create>`.

The SDK returns the value of the user API key when you create it. Make
sure to store the ``key`` value securely so that you can use it to log in.
If you lose or do not store the ``key`` value there is no way to recover it.
You will need to create a new user API key.

You **cannot** create a user API key for a :ref:`server API key
<api-key-authentication-server-api-key>`  or an :ref:`anonymous user
<anonymous-authentication>`.

.. _react-native-look-up-a-user-api-key:

Look up a User API Key
----------------------

To get an array that lists all of a user's API keys, call
:js-sdk:`ApiKeyAuth.fetchAll() <Realm.Auth.ApiKeyAuth.html#fetchAll>`.

To find a specific API key, pass the key's ``_id`` to
:js-sdk:`ApiKeyAuth.fetch() <Realm.Auth.ApiKeyAuth.html#fetch>`.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/authenticate.snippet.look-up-user-api-key.js
   :language: javascript
   :start-after: const user = app.currentUser;

.. _react-native-enable-or-disable-a-user-api-key:

Enable or Disable an API Key
----------------------------

To enable or disable a user API key, pass the key's ``_id`` to
:js-sdk:`ApiKeyAuth.enable() <Realm.Auth.ApiKeyAuth.html#enable>` or
:js-sdk:`ApiKeyAuth.disable() <Realm.Auth.ApiKeyAuth.html#disable>`. When a key
is disabled, it cannot be used to log in on behalf of the user.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/authenticate.snippet.enable-disable-user-api-key.js
   :language: javascript
   :start-after: const user = app.currentUser;

.. _react-native-delete-a-user-api-key:

Delete an API Key
-----------------

To permanently delete a user API, pass the key's ``_id`` to
:js-sdk:`ApiKeyAuth.delete() <Realm.Auth.ApiKeyAuth.html#delete>`. Deleted keys
cannot be recovered.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/authenticate.snippet.delete-user-api-key.js
   :language: javascript
   :start-after: const user = app.currentUser;

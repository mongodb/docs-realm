To access Atlas App Services and use Atlas Device Sync with the React Native SDK,
you must first authenticate a user with an App Services authentication provider.

For more information on configuring App Services Authentication,
refer to :ref:`App Services Authentication <users-and-authentication>` in the
Atlas App Services documentation.

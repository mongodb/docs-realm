Every Realm object conforms to a specific **object type**. Object types are
classes you define that contain the properties and :ref:`relationships <react-native-relationships>`
for objects of that type using a pre-defined schema.

Realm guarantees that all objects in a realm conform to the schema for their
object type and validates objects whenever they're created, modified, or deleted.

Realm objects are fundamentally similar to a common JavaScript object but they
also bring along a few additional features like schema validation and :ref:`live
queries <react-native-live-queries>`.

The React Native SDK memory maps Realm objects directly
to native JavaScript objects, which means there's no need to use a special data
access library, such as an :wikipedia:`ORM <Object-relational_mapping>`.
Instead, you can work with Realm objects as you would any other object.

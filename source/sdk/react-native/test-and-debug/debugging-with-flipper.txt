To debug Realm apps built with React Native, use the Flipper Debugger. Flipper provides a way to visualize, inspect, and control your apps from a simple desktop interface. In addition to Flipper's intuitive interface, the :github:`Realm Flipper Plugin <realm/realm-flipper-plugin>` provides additional ways to inspect your Realm Database through:

- Live Objects: See objects in real-time.
- Schema Dependency Graph: View schemas and their relationships.
- Make changes: Create, modify and delete objects
- Query: Query the database using RQL

Requirements
------------

- Using the `Hermes JS Engine <https://reactnative.dev/docs/hermes>`_
- :github:`Realm JS version 11.0 <realm/realm-js/releases/tag/v11.0.0>` or greater

Setup 
-----

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Install the Flipper Desktop App
      
      Follow the `Getting Started with Flipper <https://fbflipper.com/docs/getting-started/>`_ guide to install Flipper for your operating system. 

   .. step:: Add Flipper to your React Native App
      
      If you did not use ``react-native init`` to initialize your app, follow the manual setup guide(s) to add Flipper to your app:

      - `Manual Android Setup <https://fbflipper.com/docs/getting-started/react-native-android/>`_
      - `Manual iOS Setup <https://fbflipper.com/docs/getting-started/react-native-ios/>`_
      
      If you did use ``react-native init`` to initialize your app and are on
      React Native version ``0.62`` or greater, Flipper integration is supported
      out of the box. Otherwise, if you are on an earlier version of React Native, follow the `Automatic Setup <https://fbflipper.com/docs/getting-started/react-native/>`_ guide. 

   .. step:: Launch the Flipper Desktop App
      
      Launch your React Native mobile app and open the Flipper Desktop application.
      Your React Native app should be available in Flipper's :guilabel:`App Inspect` tab.

   .. step:: Add the Realm Flipper Plugin to the Flipper Desktop App
      
      Within the Flipper Desktop App, click the :guilabel:`Plugin Manager` tab on the
      left-hand side. When the Plugin Manager modal opens, select the :guilabel:`Install Plugins`
      option. Search for the "realm-flipper-plugin" and install it.

      Then, click the red alert to reload the Flipper Desktop app and apply changes.

   .. step:: Install Realm Flipper Plugin Device with NPM
      
      :npm:`Realm Flipper Plugin Device <package/realm-flipper-plugin-device>` enables React Native applications to interact with Realm Flipper Plugin. Realm Flipper Plugin Device also requires the :npm:`React Native Flipper plugin <package/react-native-flipper>`. To install both, run the following command:

      .. code-block:: shell

         npm install realm-flipper-plugin-device react-native-flipper
      
      If you are developing on iOS, run the following command to auto-link the ``react-native-flipper`` module with CocoaPods:

      .. code-block:: shell

         cd ios
         pod install
         cd ..

   .. step:: Import Realm Flipper Plugin in your Code
      
      Import the ``RealmPlugin`` component ``realm-flipper-plugin-device`` package in the file in which you open a realm.

      .. code-block:: javascript

         import RealmPlugin from 'realm-flipper-plugin-device';

      Within your component's return statement, render your ``RealmPlugin`` and pass it the
      opened realm as a parameter. You can pass in multiple opened realms.

      .. code-block:: javascript

         return (    
            <View>
               <RealmPlugin realms={[realm]} /> {/* pass in the Realm to the plugin*/}
               // ...
            </View>
         );

      Navigate back to the Realm Flipper Desktop app. Under the
      :guilabel:`Enabled` plugins, you should see the :guilabel:`Realm` plugin. 
      
      If you don't see the :guilabel:`Realm` plugin enabled, click the
      :guilabel:`Disabled` dropdown and enable the ``Realm Flipper Plugin`` by
      tapping the :guilabel:`+ Enable Plugin` button.

      Under :guilabel:`Enabled`, you should see the ``Realm`` plugin. 

      Using the ``Realm`` Flipper plugin, you can now:
      
      - create, modify and delete your realm objects
      - query the database using RQL
      - view schemas and their relationships using the Schema Dependency Graph

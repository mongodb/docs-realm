Overview
--------

The :github:`Realm Expo template <expo/examples/tree/master/with-realm>`
provides a fully working React Native application that you can use to bootstrap
your app development project with Realm. This documentation covers how to
initialize and work with the Realm Expo template.

The Realm Expo template uses:

-  `Expo <https://docs.expo.dev/>`_, a framework to develop, build and deploy React Native applications quickly.
- :npm:`Realm React <package/@realm/react>`, an NPM package that provides an easy-to-use API to perform common Realm operations, such as querying or writing to a realm and listening to realm objects. Read the :ref:`Realm React documentation <react-native-use-realm-react>` to learn more about working with it.


Prerequisites
-------------
- `Node.js version 12 LTS or greater <https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/>`_

Setup
-----

Next, before you initialize the template, you must install the `expo cli
<https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/expo-cli/>`_ by running the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

   npm install -g expo-cli


Initialize the Template
-----------------------
To initialize a React Native application using the Realm Expo template use the Expo CLI.

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: javascript

      Use ``expo init``  with the flag ``--template @realm/expo-template-js`` to initialize a
      React Native application using the Realm Expo template with JavaScript. 

      Run the following command in your terminal: 

      .. code-block:: shell
      
         expo init MyAwesomeRealmAppJS --template @realm/expo-template-js

   .. tab::
      :tabid: typescript

      Use ``expo init``  with the flag ``--template @realm/expo-template-ts`` to initialize a
      React Native application using the Realm Expo template with TypeScript. 

      Run the following command in your terminal: 

      .. code-block:: shell

         expo init MyAwesomeRealmApp --template @realm/expo-template-ts

Explore The File Structure
--------------------------

The relevant files are as follows:

.. cssclass:: config-table
.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - File
     - Purpose

   * - Task.ts
     - A typescript file that defines a Task :ref:`object schema
       <react-native-object-schemas>` and returns a ``RealmProvider`` and the hooks.
      
   * - App.ts
     - The entry point to the application, which contains methods to create,
       update, and delete tasks. The ``RealmProvider`` component wraps around
       the ``App`` component, providing your entire application with access to
       the realm.

   * - TaskList.tsx
     - A React component that gets a list of Task objects from the realm and renders each object as a ``TaskItem``  component.

   * - TaskItem.tsx
     - A React component that displays the task's description, a checkbox to
       toggle the task's completion status, and a button to delete the task.

   Once you have explored your file structure, we recommend reading the
   :ref:`Realm React <react-native-use-realm-react>` documentation to learn how
   to work with Realm React.

Build and Run the Application
-----------------------------

To run your application on an :android:`Android emulator <studio/run/emulator>`,
run the following command from your application root:

.. code-block:: shell
   
   expo run:android

To run your application on an :apple:`iOS simulator
<documentation/xcode/running-your-app-in-the-simulator-or-on-a-device>`, run the
following command from your application root:

.. code-block:: shell
   
   expo run:ios

When the application builds, you will see something similar to the following image:

.. image:: /images/realm-expo-template.png
   :width: 300px
   :alt: Realm Expo Template on an iOS Simulator

When you run the commands above, the Expo `dev-client
<https://docs.expo.dev/development/getting-started/>`_ will start automatically.
If you close your Expo ``dev-client`` and want to restart it without waiting for
the native build process again, you can simply run: 

.. code-block:: shell
   
   expo start --dev-client

However, if you made any `changes to the native code
<https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/customizing/>`_, you will have to re-run ``expo
run:ios`` or ``expo run:android`` to rebuild your native iOS/Android app.

Deploying Your Application
--------------------------
To deploy your application, we recommend using the `Expo Application Services (EAS)
<https://docs.expo.dev/eas/>`_, a suite of deeply integrated cloud services for
Expo and React Native apps. EAS allows you to compile and :wikipedia:`sign
<Code_signing>` your App, upload your app to the Apple App Store or Google
Play Store with a single CLI command, and push bug fixes or small changes
directly to app users. 

Alternatively, read the `Expo Distribution Overview
<https://docs.expo.dev/distribution/introduction/>`_ guide to learn how to
create native builds, deploy to app stores, avoid common app store rejections, and
manage different release environments.

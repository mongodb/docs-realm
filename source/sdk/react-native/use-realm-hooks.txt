Overview
--------
Realm Hooks provides an easy-to-use API to perform common Realm operations, such
as querying or writing to a realm and listening to realm objects.

Using Realm React Hooks allows you to avoid creating boilerplate code, such as
creating your own listeners and state management. Realm React Hooks provides a
set of React Hooks, which return state-aware Realm data. This means that React
components using the Realm React Hooks will re-render whenever you change the
Realm data.

         To install Realm Hooks on an existing React Native application, run the
         following command in your terminal from the root of your application
         where your ``package.json`` file is located:

         .. code-block:: shell

            npm i @realm/react

     - id: use-expo-to-install-realm-hooks
       name: Install with Expo
       content: |
         If you don't have an existing application, we recommend developing with
         the Realm Expo template. The Realm Expo template allows you to
         bootstrap your application with `Expo <https://docs.expo.dev/>`_ and
         Realm Hooks preconfigured.

         To initialize the Realm Expo template, read the :ref:`Quick Start
         with Expo <react-native-client-quick-start-expo>` documentation.

Geospatial data, or "geodata", specifies points and geometric objects on the Earth's 
surface. With the geodata types, you can create queries that check whether a given  
point is contained within a shape. For example, you can find all coffee shops within 
15 km of a specified point.

Geospatial Data Types
---------------------

.. _react-native-geopoint:

GeoPoint
~~~~~~~~

A :js-sdk:`GeoPoint <types/Realm.GeoPoint.html>` defines a specific 
location on the Earth's surface. All of the geospatial data types use ``GeoPoints`` 
to define their location. 

``GeoPoint`` can be one of three types:

- An object with:

  - ``latitude``: a number value
  - ``longitude``: a number value
  - ``altitude``: an optional number value
- ``CanonicalGeoPoint``:  an interface that satisfies the GeoJSON specifications for a point
- ``GeoPosition``: an array with longitude, latitude, and an optional altitude

A GeoPoint is used only as a building block of the other shapes: 
GeoCircle, GeoBox, and GeoPolygon. These shapes, and the GeoPoint type, 
are used in queries, not for persistance.

To save geospatial data to realm, refer to :ref:`node-persist-geopoint`.

.. _react-native-geocircle:

GeoCircle
~~~~~~~~~

A :js-sdk:`GeoCircle <types/Realm.GeoCircle.html>` defines a circle on 
the Earth's surface. You define a ``GeoCircle`` by providing:

- A ``GeoPoint`` for the center of the circle
- A number for the distance (radius) of the circle 

The radius distance uses radians as the unit of measure. The SDK 
provides the methods ``kmToRadians`` and ``miToRadians`` to convert 
kilometers or miles to radians.

The following code shows two examples of creating a circle:

.. _react-native-geobox:

GeoBox
~~~~~~

A :js-sdk:`GeoBox <types/Realm.GeoBox.html>` defines a rectangle on  
the Earth's surface. You define the rectangle by specifying the bottom left 
(southwest) corner and the top right (northeast) corner. A GeoBox behaves 
in the same way as the corresponding :ref:`GeoPolygon <node-geopolygon>`.

The following example creates 2 boxes:

.. include:: /examples/generated/react-native/v12/Geospatial.snippet.geobox.tsx.rst

.. figure:: /images/geoboxes.png
   :alt: 2 GeoBoxes

.. _react-native-geopolygon:

GeoPolygon
~~~~~~~~~~

A :js-sdk:`GeoPolygon <types/Realm.GeoPolygon.html>` defines a polygon 
on the Earth's surface. Because a polygon is a closed shape, you must provide a 
minimum of 4 points: 3 points to define the polygon's shape, and a fourth to 
close the shape.

.. important::

   The fourth point in a polygon must be the same as the first point.

You can also exclude areas within a polygon by defining one or more "holes". A 
hole is another polygon whose bounds fit completely within the outer polygon. 
The following example creates 3 polygons: one is a basic polygon with 5 points, 
one is the same polygon with a single hole, and the third is the same polygon 
with two holes:

.. _react-native-persist-geopoint:

Persist Geospatial Data
-----------------------

If you want to persist geospatial data, it must conform to the 
`GeoJSON spec <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946>`_. 

Create a GeoJSON-Compatible Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a class that conforms to the GeoJSON spec, you:

1. Create an embedded realm object. For more information about embedded
   objects, refer to :ref:`node-data-types-embedded-objects`.

#. At a minimum, add the two fields required by the GeoJSON spec:

   - A field of type ``double[]`` that maps to a "coordinates" (case sensitive) 
     property in the realm schema. 

   - A field of type ``string`` that maps to a "type" property. The value of this 
     field must be "Point".

To simplify geodata persistance, you can define a model that implements 
``CanonicalGeoPoint``, which already has the correct shape. The following 
example shows an embedded class named ``MyGeoPoint`` that is used 
to persist geospatial data:

.. include:: /examples/generated/react-native/v12/Geospatial.snippet.define-geopoint-class.tsx.rst

Use the Embedded Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You then use the custom ``MyGeoPoint`` class in your realm model, as shown in the 
following example. You add instances of your class to the realm just like any other Realm 
model. However, in this example, because the ``MyGeoPoint`` class does not 
extend ``Realm.Object``, we must specify ``MyGeoPoint.schema`` when opening 
the realm:

.. include:: /examples/generated/react-native/v12/Geospatial.snippet.open-realm-geospatial.tsx.rst

Within ``RealmProvider``, create your geospatial objects by combining the
embedded class with classes that extend ``Realm.Object``.

.. include:: /examples/generated/react-native/v12/Geospatial.snippet.write-geospatial-object.tsx.rst

The following image shows the results of creating these two company objects.

.. _react-native-query-geospatial:

Query Geospatial Data
---------------------

To query against geospatial data, you can use the ``geoWithin`` operator 
with :ref:`RQL <rql>`. The ``geoWithin`` operator takes the "coordinates" 
property of an embedded object that defines the point we're querying, and 
one of the geospatial shapes to check if that point is contained within 
the shape. 

.. note::

   The format for querying geospatial data is the same, regardless of the 
   shape of the geodata region.

The following examples show querying against various shapes to return a list of 
companies within the shape:

Geospatial data, or "geodata", specifies points and geometric objects on the Earth's 
surface. With the geodata types, you can create queries that check whether a given  
point is contained within a shape. For example, you can find all coffee shops within 
15 km of a specified point.

Geospatial Data Types
---------------------

.. _react-native-geopoint:

GeoPoint
~~~~~~~~

A :js-sdk:`GeoPoint <INSERT-API-REFERENCE-LINK>` defines a specific 
location on the Earth's surface. All of the geospatial data types use ``GeoPoints`` 
to define their location. 

.. note::
   
   In methods that take a ``GeoPoint``, you can alternatively provide a tuple of 
   doubles, where the first double is the longitude and the second double is the 
   latitude. The SDK interprets these tuples as ``GeoPoints``. The examples on 
   this page demonstrate both approaches.

.. _react-native-geocircle:

GeoCircle
~~~~~~~~~

A :js-sdk:`GeoCircle <INSERT-API-REFERENCE-LINK>` defines a circle on 
the Earth's surface. You define a ``GeoCircle`` by providing a ``GeoPoint`` 
for the center of the circle and a :js-sdk:`Distance <INSERT-API-REFERENCE-LINK>` 
object to specify the radius of the circle. 

.. note::
   
   You can define the radius in kilometers, miles, degrees, or radians.

The following code shows two examples of creating a circle:

   :language: csharp

.. _react-native-geobox:

GeoBox
~~~~~~

A :js-sdk:`GeoBox <INSERT-API-REFERENCE-LINK>` defines a rectangle on  
the Earth's surface. You define the rectangle by specifying the bottom left 
(southwest) corner and the top right (northeast) corner. The following example 
creates 2 boxes:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/Geospatial.snippet.geobox.cs
   :language: csharp

.. figure:: /images/geoboxes.png
   :alt: 2 GeoBoxes

.. _react-native-geopolygon:

GeoPolygon
~~~~~~~~~~

A :js-sdk:`GeoPolygon <INSERT-API-REFERENCE-LINK>` defines a polygon 
on the Earth's surface. Because a polygon is a closed shape, you must provide a 
minimum of 4 points: 3 points to define the polygon's shape, and a fourth to 
close the shape.

.. important::

   The fourth point in a polygon must be the same as the first point.

You can also exclude areas within a polygon by defining one or more "holes". A 
hole is another polygon whose bounds fit completely within the outer polygon. 
The following example creates 3 polygons: one is a basic polygon with 5 points, 
one is the same polygon with a single hole, and the third is the same polygon 
with two holes:

.. _react-native-persist-geopoint:

Persist GeoPoint Data
---------------------

If you want to persist ``GeoPoint`` data, it must conform to the 
`GeoJSON spec <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946>`_. 

Create a GeoJSON-Compatible Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a class that conforms to the GeoJSON spec, you:

1. Create an embedded realm object (a class that inherits from 
   :js-sdk:`IEmbeddedObject <INSERT-API-REFERENCE-LINK>`).

#. At a minimum, add the two fields required by the GeoJSON spec:

   - A field of type ``IList<double>`` that maps to a "coordinates" (case sensitive) 
     property in the realm schema. 

   - A field of type ``string`` that maps to a "type" property. The value of this 
     field must be "Point".

The following example shows an embedded class named "CustomGeoPoint" that is used 
to persist GeoPoint data:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/CustomGeoPoint.snippet.customgeopoint.cs
   :language: csharp

Use the Embedded Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You then use the custom GeoPoint class in your realm model, as shown in the 
following example:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/Geospatial.snippet.usingcustomgeopoint.cs
   :language: csharp
   :emphasize-lines: 7

You then add instances of your class to realm just like any other Realm model:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/Geospatial.snippet.geopoint.cs
   :language: csharp

The following image shows the results of creating these two company objects.

.. _react-native-query-geospatial:

Query Geospatial Data
---------------------

To query against geospatial data, you can use the 
:js-sdk:`GeoWithin <INSERT-API-REFERENCE-LINK>` 
method, or you can use the ``geoWithin`` operator with :ref:`RQL <rql>`. 
The ``GeoWithin`` method takes the "coordinates" property of an embedded object 
that defines the point we're querying, and one of the geospatial shapes to 
check if that point is contained within the shape. 

.. note::

   The format for querying geospatial data is the same regardless the shape of 
   the geodata region.

The following example shows the difference between querying with the ``GeoWithin`` 
method and RQL:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/dotnet/Geospatial.snippet.rql-geowithin.cs
   :language: csharp

The following examples show querying against various shapes to return a list of 
companies within the shape:

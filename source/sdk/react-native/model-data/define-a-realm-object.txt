Realm Schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **realm schema** is a list of valid :ref:`object schemas
<react-native-object-schemas>` that a realm may contain. Every Realm object must conform
to an object type that's included in its realm's schema.

If a realm already contains data when you open it, Realm Database
validates each object to ensure that an object schema was provided for its type
and that it meets all of the constraints specified in the schema.

Using ``@realm/react``, you define a realm schema by passing individual object
schemas to ``<RealmProvider>`` or ``createRealmContext()``.

Define an Object Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To define a Realm object type, create a class that extends ``Realm.Object``. 
Define the type's ``name`` and ``properties`` in a static property called ``schema``. 
The type's name must be unique among object types in a realm.

Then you can pass the class itself to the schema property of the :js-sdk:`Realm.Configuration
<Realm.html#~Configuration>` object when opening a realm.

To learn the various types that a Realm Object Model accepts, how to specify
optional fields, define relationships, embedded objects, primary keys, and more,
check out the :ref:`Schemas <react-native-schemas-overview>` section.

TypeScript and Required Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend :ref:`creating Realm objects <react-native-create-a-new-object>` 
with :js-sdk:`Realm.create() <Realm.html#create>`, but you can also use the
``new`` operator for your object model's class.

If you use ``new``, you must add your class as a generic, along with any
required properties, when extending ``Realm.Object``. This enables full
TypeScript support for your object model, including type errors when required
fields are not defined.

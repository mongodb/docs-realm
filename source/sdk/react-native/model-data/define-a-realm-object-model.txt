Define an Object Type
---------------------

To define a Realm object type, create a class that extends ``Realm.Object``. 
Define the type's ``name`` and ``properties`` in a static property called ``schema``. 
The type's name must be unique among object types in a realm.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: javascript

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/react-native/js/Book.snippet.js-book-schema.js
        :language: javascript

Then you can pass the class itself to the schema property of the :js-sdk:`Realm.Configuration
<Realm.html#~Configuration>` object when opening a realm.

Supported Property Types
------------------------

Every property in a Realm object has a strongly defined data type. A
property's type can be a primitive data type or an object type defined in the
same realm. The type also specifies whether the property contains a single
value or a list of values.

To specify that a field contains a list of a primitive value type, append ``[]``
to the type name.

For a list of supported property types, see :ref:`Property Types 
<react-native-supported-property-types>`

.. _react-native-define-a-property:

Define Object Properties
------------------------

To define a property for an object type, create a key-value pair representing
the name and data type of the property under the ``properties`` field.
   
The following schema defines a ``Car`` type that has these properties: ``_id``
``make``, ``model``, and ``miles``.

.. _react-native-specify-an-optional-property:
.. _react-native-optional-properties:

Declare an Optional Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To mark a property as optional, append a question mark ``?`` to its type. You can
also add ``optional`` to more complicated properties and set it to ``true`` or
``false``.

In the following example of a ``Dog`` class, the ``age`` property of type
``int`` is optional.

.. _react-native-specify-a-primary-key:
.. _react-native-primary-keys:

Declare a Primary Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To specify a property as an object type's primary key, set the schema's
``primaryKey`` field to the property name.

.. note::
   
   A **primary key** is a property that uniquely identifies an
   object. Realm Database automatically :ref:`indexes <react-native-indexes>`
   primary key properties, which allows you to read and modify objects based
   on their primary key efficiently.
   
   If an object type has a primary key, then all objects of that type must
   include the primary key property with a unique value among objects of
   the same type in a realm. An object type can have only one primary
   key. You cannot change the primary key property for an object type after any
   object of that type is added to a realm, and you cannot modify an object's
   primary key value.

In the following example of a ``Task`` class, we specify the ``_id`` property as
the primary key.

.. _react-native-index-a-property:
.. _react-native-indexes:

Index a Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you frequently run :ref:`read operations <react-native-read-operations>` 
based on a specific property, you can index the property to optimize 
performance. Realm supports indexing for string, integer, boolean, ``Date``, 
``UUID``, and ``ObjectId`` properties. 

.. note::

   An **index** significantly increases the speed of certain read operations at
   the cost of slightly slower write times and additional storage and memory
   overhead. Realm Database stores indexes on disk, which makes your realm files
   larger. Each index entry is a minimum of 12 bytes. The ordering of the index
   entries supports efficient equality matches and range-based query operations. 

To index a given property, set the property's ``indexed`` field to ``true``.

In the following example of a ``Book`` class, we define an index on the ``name``
property.

.. _react-native-define-a-default-property-value:
.. _react-native-default-values:

Set a Default Property Value
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To define a default value, set the value of the property to an object with a
``type`` field and a ``default`` field.

In the following example of a ``Car`` class, we define a ``miles`` property with
a default value of ``0``. 

.. versionadded:: 11.1.0

In Realm.js v11.1.0 and later, you can use a function to define a dynamic
default value, like the ``timestamp`` property in the example below.

.. _react-native-remap-a-property:

Remap a Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use a different property name in your code than is stored in
Realm Database, set ``mapTo`` to the name of the property as it appears in
your code.

In the following example of an ``Employee`` class, we remap the ``first_name``
property to ``firstName``.

TypeScript and Required Properties
----------------------------------

We recommend :ref:`creating Realm objects <react-native-create-a-new-object>` 
with :js-sdk:`Realm.create() <Realm.html#create>`, but you can also use the
``new`` operator for your object model's class.

If you use ``new``, you must add your class as a generic, along with any
required properties, when extending ``Realm.Object``. This enables full
TypeScript support for your object model, including type errors when required
fields are not defined.

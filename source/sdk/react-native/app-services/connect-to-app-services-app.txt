The App client is the interface to the App Services
backend. It provides access to the :ref:`authentication functionality
<react-native-authenticate-users>`, :ref:`Atlas Functions <react-native-call-a-function>`,
and :ref:`Atlas Device Sync <react-native-realm-sync>`.

Before You Begin
----------------

#. :ref:`Create an App Services App <create-a-realm-app>`
#. :ref:`Get Your App ID <find-your-app-id>`

.. _react-native-app-client-configuration:
.. _react-native-access-the-app-client:

Configure the App Client
------------------------

To set up your App client, pass the App ID string
to the ``id`` prop of the ``AppProvider``.
Wrap any components that need to access the App with the ``AppProvider``.
In this example, we wrap the :ref:`UserProvider <react-native-user-provider>` 
in the ``AppProvider`` to authenticate a user.

.. include:: /examples/generated/react-native/v12/use-app.snippet.app-config.tsx.rst

You can create multiple App client instances to connect to multiple
Apps. All App client instances that share the same App ID use the same 
underlying connection.

.. important:: Changing an App Config After Initializing the App
   
   .. versionchanged:: ``realm@12.6.0``

   When you initialize the App client, the configuration is cached internally. 
   Attempting to "close" and then re-open an App with a changed configuration
   within the same process has no effect. The client continues to use the 
   cached configuration. 

   Starting with React Native SDK version 12.6.0, the ``baseUrl`` in the ``AppConfiguration``
   is *not* cached. This means that you can change the 
   ``baseUrl`` - including at runtime - and the App client will use the updated 
   configuration. In earlier SDK versions, changes to the ``baseUrl`` in a 
   cached App configuration have no 
   effect.

.. _react-native-app-retrieve-client:

Retrieve an Instance of the App Client
--------------------------------------

All components wrapped within an ``AppProvider`` can access the :js-sdk:`App <Realm.App.html>`
client with the ``useApp()`` hook.

.. include:: /examples/generated/react-native/v12/use-app.snippet.import-use-app.tsx.rst
.. include:: /examples/generated/react-native/v12/use-app.snippet.use-app.tsx.rst

.. _react-native-retrieve-client-outside-provider:

Retrieve App Outside the App Provider
-------------------------------------

To retrieve an instance of the App Client from anywhere in your application,
instantiate a new instance of :js-sdk:`Realm.App() <Realm.App.html>`
from the ``realm`` package, then pass in your ``App ID``.

.. code-block:: typescript

   import Realm from 'realm';

   const app = Realm.App.getApp("<Your App ID>");

.. _react-native-encrypt-app-metadata:

Encrypt App Metadata
--------------------

You can encrypt the metadata that App Services stores on client devices. Use the
values of the :js-sdk:`MetadataMode enum <enums/_internal_.MetadataMode.html>`
to determine encryption behavior.

To encrypt App metadata:

#. Import ``MetadataMode`` from ``Realm`` and import other dependencies:

   .. include:: /examples/generated/react-native/v12/EncryptMetadata.snippet.imports.tsx.rst

#. Create an App configuration object that contains the ``metadata`` property.
#. Set ``metadata.mode`` to ``MetadataMode.Encryption``.
#. Set ``metadata.encryptionKey`` to the key you want to use for encryption.
#. Pass the App configuration object to ``new Realm.App()``.

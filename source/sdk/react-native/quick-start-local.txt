Overview
--------

This page contains information to quickly get {+client-database+}
integrated into your app.

.. important::

   If you will be using :ref:`Sync <sync>` and other backend features of 
   {+service-short+} in your app, see :ref:`<react-native-client-quick-start>`.

.. _react-native-quickstart-local-import-realm:

Import Realm
------------
At the top of your source files where you want to use {+service+}, add
the following line to import the SDK.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/quickstart-local.codeblock.import-realm.js
  :language: javascript

.. _react-native-quickstart-local-define-an-object-model:

Define Your Object Model
------------------------
Your application's :ref:`object model <react-native-object-schemas>` defines the data
that you can store within {+client-database+}. 

To define a Realm object type, create a schema object that specifies the type's
``name`` and ``properties``. The type name must be unique among object types in
a {+realm+}. For details on how to define specific properties, see :ref:`Define
Object Properties <react-native-define-a-property>`.

.. example::

   The following code shows how to define an object model for a ``Task`` object. In this example:
     
   - The ``primaryKey`` is the ``_id`` of type ``int`` (Another common type used for primary keys is :js-sdk:`ObjectId <Realm.Object.html#objectId>`).
   - The ``name`` field is required. The
   - The ``status`` is optional, denoted by the question mark immediately after the data type.
    
   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/quickstart-local.codeblock.define-an-object-model.js
     :language: javascript

.. _react-native-quickstart-local-open-a-realm:

Open a Realm
------------
To open a {+realm+}, pass a :js-sdk:`Realm.Configuration
<Realm.html#~Configuration>` object to either :js-sdk:`Realm.open()
<Realm.html#.open>` or :js-sdk:`new Realm() <Realm.html>`.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/quickstart-local.codeblock.open-a-realm.js
  :language: javascript

.. _react-native-quickstart-local-create-realm-objects:

Create Realm Objects
--------------------

Once you have opened a {+realm+}, you can create :ref:`objects
<react-native-object-types>` in it. All writes must occur within a :ref:`Write
transaction <react-native-write-transactions>`.

.. example::

   In the following example, an application developer creates two tasks. One task
   with a name of "go grocery shopping" and another with the name of "go
   exercise". Both tasks have a status of "Open".
    
   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/quickstart-local.codeblock.create-realm-objects.js
     :language: javascript

.. _react-native-quickstart-local-find-sort-and-filter-objects:

Find, Sort, and Filter Objects
------------------------------
The following code demonstrates how to:

- Query for all instances of the "Task" object type.
- Filter the query to retrieve only the tasks that are "Open".
- Sort the tasks by the name in an ascending order.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/quickstart-local.codeblock.find-sort-and-filter-objects.js
  :language: javascript

.. _react-native-quickstart-local-modify-an-object:

Modify an Object
----------------
As with writes, any changes to a Realm object must occur within a 
:ref:`Write transaction <react-native-write-transactions>` block. 
To modify an object, you update the object properties:

.. example::

   In the following example, an application developer updates ``task1`` from the
   :ref:`Create Realm Objects <react-native-quickstart-local-create-realm-objects>`
   example above. The developer begins progress on the "go grocery shopping
   task" and sets ``task1`` to "InProgress".
    
   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/quickstart-local.codeblock.modify-an-object.js
     :language: javascript

.. _react-native-quickstart-local-delete-an-object:

Delete an Object
----------------
You can delete an object by calling the :js-sdk:`realm.delete()
<Realm.html#delete>` method within a write transaction block:

.. example::

   In the following example, an application developer deletes ``task1`` from the
   :ref:`Create Realm Objects <react-native-quickstart-local-create-realm-objects>`
   example above. 
    
   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/quickstart-local.codeblock.delete-an-object.js
     :language: javascript

.. _react-native-quickstart-local-watch-a-collection:

Watch a Collection
------------------
You can :ref:`watch a realm, collection, or object for changes
<react-native-change-notifications>` by registering event handlers with the
:js-sdk:`Realm.addListener() <Realm.html#addListener>`
:js-sdk:`Object.addListener() <Realm.Object.html#addListener>`
:js-sdk:`Collection.addListener() <Realm.Collection.html#addListener>`
methods.

.. example::

   In the following example, an application developer watches for changes to the
   ``Task`` collection.
    
   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/quickstart-local.codeblock.watch-a-collection.js
     :language: javascript

.. _react-native-quickstart-local-close-a-realm:

Close a Realm
-------------
Call the :js-sdk:`realm.close() <Realm.html#close>` method when done with a realm instance to avoid memory leaks.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/quickstart-local.codeblock.close-a-realm.js
  :language: javascript


.. _react-native-quickstart-local-complete:

Complete Example
----------------

Code
~~~~

The following code is a fully runnable example that includes all of the concepts
on this page.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/quickstart-local.codeblock.complete.js
  :language: javascript

Output
~~~~~~

Running the above code should output something like the following:

.. code-block:: shell

   created two tasks: go grocery shopping & go exercise
   
   The lists of tasks are: go grocery shopping,go exercise
   
   The lists of open tasks are: go grocery shopping,go exercise

   modifiedTask: {
     "_id": 1,
     "name": "go grocery shopping",
     "status": "InProgress"
   }
   
   A task was deleted at the 0 index

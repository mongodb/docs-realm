:npm:`@realm/react <package/@realm/react>` is an npm package that provides
an easy-to-use API to perform common Realm operations, such as querying,
writing to a realm, and listening to realm objects.

``@realm/react`` helps you avoid creating boilerplate code, such as creating
your own listeners and state management. ``@realm/react`` provides access to
Realm through a set of hooks that update React state when the Realm data changes.
This means that components using these hooks re-render on any changes to data
in the realm.

Setup @realm/react
------------------

To set up ``@realm/react``, you can either start from scratch with a new application
using the :github:`Realm Expo template <expo/examples/tree/master/with-realm>`
or install ``@realm/react`` for an existing `React Native application
<https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup#creating-a-new-application>`_.

Create a New App with @realm/react
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you don't have an existing application, we recommend developing it with
the :github:`Realm Expo template <expo/examples/tree/master/with-realm>`.
The Realm Expo template allows you to bootstrap your application with
`Expo <https://docs.expo.dev/>`_ and ``@realm/react`` preconfigured.

To initialize the Realm Expo template, read the :ref:`Quick Start with Expo
<react-native-client-bootstrap-with-expo>` documentation.

Add @realm/react to an Existing App
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install ``@realm/react`` on an existing React Native application, run the
following command in your terminal from the root of your application
where your ``package.json`` file is located:

.. code-block:: shell

    npm install @realm/react

.. _react-native-realm-context:

createRealmContext()
--------------------

The ``createRealmContext()`` method creates a :reactjs:`React Context
<docs/context.html>` object for a realm with a given :js-sdk:`Realm.Configuration
<Realm.html#~Configuration>`. The ``Context`` object contains the
following: 

- A :reactjs:`Context Provider <docs/context.html#contextprovider>` component that wraps around a component and provides any of its child components with access to the hooks.
- Various pre-built :reactjs:`Hooks <docs/hooks-intro.html>` that you can use to access the opened realm, query the realm, etc.

Setup
~~~~~

We recommend creating a file where you will define a Realm object type, a Realm
configuration, and create a Realm ``Context``. At the top of the file, import
Realm and the ``createRealmContext()`` method.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/expo/Task.snippet.add-imports-to-task.ts
    :language: typescript

Next, define a Object Schema using a JavaScript class. The ``Task``
class below contains the following:

- A ``generate()`` method that returns a ``Task`` insertion object that automatically sets computed values, such as ``_id`` and ``createdAt``. This insertion can be forwarded to ``realm.create`` to perform an insertion 
- A ``schema`` property that defines this Object Schema. Read the :ref:`Define a Realm Object Schema <react-native-define-a-realm-object-schema>` documentation to learn more.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/expo/Task.snippet.create-task-class.ts
    :language: typescript

Finally, create a ``Realm.Configuration`` object and set its ``schema`` property
to the classes you have created. Pass the configuration object to the
``createRealmContext()`` method. Export the return value of
``createRealmContext()``, so you can use the ``Context`` object in other files.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/expo/Task.snippet.create-realm-context.ts
    :language: typescript

.. _react-native-realm-provider:

RealmProvider
-------------

Wrap the component needing access to Realm, typically near the top
of your application, with the ``RealmProvider`` component included in the
``Context`` object, which was returned from ``createRealmContext()``.  The
``RealmProvider`` provides child components access to the configured
Realm through the hooks included in the ``Context`` object.

For simple use-cases, you may want to wrap your entire application in the
``RealmProvider`` component, such as the example below. For additional security,
you may only want to give access to the opened realm to specific screens, or
after the user has logged-in.

Usage
~~~~~

Import the ``Context`` object that you created. In the example below, the
``Context`` object is called ``TaskContext`` since it refers to the Realm ``Context`` of
the Task. You can :mdn:`Destructure
<Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#object_destructuring>`
the ``TaskContext`` object to get its ``RealmProvider``. 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/expo/AppWrapper.snippet.import-task-context.tsx
    :language: typescript

Wrap the ``RealmProvider`` around the component that you want
to give access to the configured realm. In the example below, we give the entire
app access to the realm by wrapping the ``RealmProvider`` around
the ``App`` component, which renders the application.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/expo/AppWrapper.snippet.wrap-app-within-realm-provider.tsx
    :language: typescript

Dynamically Update the Realm Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can dynamically update the Realm configuration by setting
:reactjs:`props <docs/components-and-props.html>` on the ``RealmProvider``
component. The props you set on the ``RealmProvider`` will overwrite any
property passed into ``createRealmContext()``.

In the following example, we update the ``RealmProvider`` with a :js-sdk:`sync
configuration <Realm.App.Sync.html#~SyncConfiguration>` and a ``fallback``
property that is used to render a temporary ``LoadingSpinner`` component while
waiting for Device Sync to fully synchronize data before opening the realm:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/expo/AppWrapper.snippet.dynamically-update-realm-config.tsx
    :language: typescript

The Realm Hooks
---------------

Once you have wrapped your component with your ``RealmProvider``, your component
and its child components will have access to the ``useRealm()``,
``useObject()``, and ``useQuery()`` hooks.

Import the ``Task`` model and ``Context`` object that you created. In the example below, the
``Context`` object, called ``TaskContext``, refers to the ``Context`` of
the Task. :mdn:`Destructure <Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#object_destructuring>`
the ``TaskContext`` object to get its hooks.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/expo/App.snippet.get-access-to-the-hooks.tsx
    :language: typescript

.. _react-native-use-realm-hook:

useRealm()
~~~~~~~~~~

The ``useRealm()`` hook returns the opened realm instance.

The ``handleAddTask()`` method of the ``App`` component writes to the realm
returned by the ``useRealm()`` hook in the following example.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/expo/App.snippet.example-userealm-hook-usage.tsx
    :language: typescript

The :js-sdk:`Realm.create() <Realm.html#create>` call invokes the ``Task.generate()``
method defined in the ``Task`` class.  This method instantiates a JavaScript object
with default values for the ``_id``, ``isComplete``, and ``createdAt`` properties.

To learn more about modifying Realm data, refer to :ref:`Write Transactions
<react-native-write-transactions>`.

.. _react-native-use-object-hook:

useObject()
~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``useObject()`` hook returns a Realm object for a given
:ref:`primary key <react-native-primary-keys>`. You can invoke it with the class
model definition (this will add types to the returned object in TypeScript) or
the class name as a string and the primary key. The ``useObject()`` method
returns null if the object doesn't exist or you have deleted it.  The hook will
automatically subscribe to updates and re-render the component using the hook on
any change to the object.

In the following example, the ``useObject()`` hook retrieves a ``Task`` object,
and its description is rendered in the UI.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/expo/SampleTask.snippet.example-useobject-hook-usage.tsx
    :language: typescript

.. _react-native-use-query-hook:

useQuery()
~~~~~~~~~~

The ``useQuery()`` hook returns a collection of realm objects of a given type.
Like ``useObject``, it is either invoked with the Object Schema class or the model
name as a string.  The ``useQuery()`` method subscribes to updates to any
objects in the collection and re-renders the component using it on any change to the query results.

In the following example, of a ``TaskList`` component, The ``Task``
class is passed to the ``useQuery()`` and the tasks are set as a ``data`` prop
of a `FlatList <https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist>`_ component.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/expo/TaskList.snippet.tasklist-use-query-example.tsx
    :language: typescript
    :emphasize-lines: 2, 6

To learn how to render a :ref:`filtered <react-native-filter-results>` or
:ref:`sorted <react-native-sort-results>` list of tasks, read the :ref:`CRUD - Read
<react-native-read-objects>` docs.

.. _react-native-app-provider:

AppProvider
-----------

To use Realm features such as authentication and sync, use the
``AppProvider`` to initiate a new :js-sdk:`Realm.App <Realm.App.html>`. Wrap the
``AppProvider`` outside of the ``RealmProvider`` and any components which need
access to the :ref:`useApp <react-native-use-app-hook>` hook.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/expo/AppWrapper.snippet.wrap-app-within-app-provider.tsx
    :language: typescript
    :emphasize-lines: 1, 5

.. _react-native-use-app-hook:

useApp()
~~~~~~~~

The ``useApp()`` hook provides access to the :js-sdk:`Realm.App <Realm.App.html>`
instance.

In the following example, we call ``useApp()`` within a ``LoginComponent``, and
then use the app instance to log in with email/password authentication.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/expo/LoginComponent.snippet.useApp-hook-usage.tsx
    :language: typescript
    :emphasize-lines: 1, 7, 11

.. _react-native-user-provider:

UserProvider
------------

The ``UserProvider`` provides a :js-sdk:`Realm user <Realm.User.html>` for its
child components to access.

The ``UserProvider``:

- contains an optional ``fallback`` property that renders a Login component when
  the user has not authenticated.
- renders its child components only if the user is logged in or has
  no fallback property.

When the ``UserProvider`` wraps the ``RealmProvider``, the ``RealmProvider``
automatically sets the logged-in user for your sync configuration. This means
you do not need to specify your user in your sync configuration object.

In the following example, we pass a Login component to the fallback property of
``UserProvider``. Once the user has logged in, the Login component disappears
from the view, and the ``App`` is rendered. We wrap the ``App`` in a
``RealmProvider`` with a sync configuration to give the ``App`` access to a
synced realm. If the user logs out, the application falls back to
the Login component.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/expo/AppWrapper.snippet.wrap-app-within-app-and-user-provider.tsx
    :language: typescript
    :emphasize-lines: 1, 6

.. _react-native-use-user-hook:

useUser()
~~~~~~~~~

The ``useUser()`` hook provides access to the logged-in user.

In the following example, we call ``useApp()`` within a ``SampleTask``
component and display the logged-in user's ``_id``.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/expo/SampleSyncedTask.snippet.useUser-hook-usage.tsx
    :language: typescript
    :emphasize-lines: 1, 5, 11

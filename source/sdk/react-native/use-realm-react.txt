Overview
--------
:npm:`Realm React <package/@realm/react>` provides an easy-to-use API to perform
common Realm operations, such as querying or writing to a realm and listening to
realm objects.

Using Realm React helps you avoid creating boilerplate code, such as
creating your own listeners and state management. Realm React provides access to Realm through a
set of hooks, which return Realm data that are automatically subscribed to updates. This means that
components using these hooks will re-render on any changes to Realm data.

Setup Realm React
-----------------
To set up Realm React, you can either start from scratch with a new application
using the :github:`Realm Expo template <expo/examples/tree/master/with-realm>`
or install Realm React for an existing `React Native application
<https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup#creating-a-new-application>`_.

       name: Create a New App with Realm React
       content: |
         If you don't have an existing application, we recommend developing it with
         the :github:`Realm Expo template <expo/examples/tree/master/with-realm>`.
         The Realm Expo template allows you to bootstrap your application with
         `Expo <https://docs.expo.dev/>`_ and Realm React preconfigured.

         To initialize the Realm Expo template, read the :ref:`Quick Start
         with Expo <react-native-client-quick-start-expo>` documentation.

       name: Add Realm React to an Existing App
       content: |
         To install Realm React on an existing React Native application, run the
         following command in your terminal from the root of your application
         where your ``package.json`` file is located:

         .. code-block:: shell

            npm install @realm/react

.. _react-native-realm-context:

Create a Realm Context
----------------------

The ``createRealmContext()`` method creates a Realm :reactjs:`Context
<docs/context.html>` object with a given :js-sdk:`Realm.Configuration
<Realm.html#~Configuration>`. The ``Realm Context`` object contains the
following: 

- A :reactjs:`Context Provider <docs/context.html#contextprovider>` component that wraps around a component and provides any of its child components with access to the hooks.
- Various pre-built :reactjs:`Hooks <docs/hooks-intro.html>` that you can use to access the opened {+realm+}, query the {+realm+}, etc.

Setup
~~~~~

We recommend creating a file where you will define a Realm object
type, a Realm configuration, and create a Realm ``Context``. At the top of the file,
import Realm and the ``createRealmContext()`` method.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/expo/Task.codeblock.add-imports-to-task.ts
    :language: typescript

Next, define a Realm model using a JavaScript class. The ``Task``
class below contains the following:

- A ``generate()`` method that returns a ``Task`` insertion object that automatically sets computed values, such as ``_id`` and ``createdAt``. This insertion can be forwarded to ``realm.create`` to perform an insertion 
- A ``schema`` property that defines this Realm Object Model. Read the :ref:`Define a Realm Object Schema <react-native-define-a-realm-object-schema>` to learn more.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/expo/Task.codeblock.create-task-class.ts
    :language: typescript

Finally, create a ``Realm.Configuration`` object and set its ``schema`` property
to the classes you have created. Pass the configuration object to the
``createRealmContext()`` method. Export the return value of
``createRealmContext()``, so you can use the ``Context`` object in other files.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/expo/Task.codeblock.create-realm-context.ts
    :language: typescript

.. _react-native-realm-provider:

Using the Realm Provider
------------------------

Wrap the component needing access to {+service-short+}, typically the top layer
of your application, with the ``RealmProvider`` component included in the
``Context`` object, which was returned from ``createRealmContext``.  The
``RealmProvider`` provides child components access to the configured
{+service-short+} through the hooks included in the ``Context`` object.

.. tip:: Choosing Which Components to Wrap inside the Realm Provider
   
   For simple use-cases, you may want to wrap your entire application in the
   ``RealmProvider`` component, such as the example below. For additional security,
   you may only want to give access to the opened {+realm+} to specific screens, or
   after the user has logged in.

Usage
~~~~~
Import the ``Context`` object that you created. In the example below, the
Context object is called "TaskContext" since it refers to the Realm ``Context`` of
the Task. You can :mdn:`Destructure
<Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#object_destructuring>`
the ``TaskContext`` object to get its ``RealmProvider``. 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/expo/App.codeblock.import-task-context.tsx
    :language: typescript

Wrap the ``RealmProvider`` around the component that you want
to give access to the configured Realm. In the example below, we give the entire
app access to the Realm by wrapping the ``RealmProvider`` around
the ``App`` component, which renders the application.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/expo/App.codeblock.wrap-app-within-realm-provider.tsx
    :language: typescript

Dynamically Update the {+service-short+} Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can dynamically update the {+service-short+} configuration by setting
:reactjs:`props <docs/components-and-props.html>` on the ``RealmProvider``
component. The props you set on the ``RealmProvider`` will overwrite any
property passed into ``createRealmContext()``.

In the following example, we update the RealmProvider with a :js-sdk:`sync
configuration <Realm.App.Sync.html#~SyncConfiguration>` and a ``fallback``
property that is used to render a temporary LoadingSpinner component while
waiting for {+sync+} to respond:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/expo/App.codeblock.dynamically-update-realm-config.tsx
    :language: typescript

Use Hooks In Child Components
-----------------------------

Once you have wrapped your component with your ``RealmProvider``, your component
and its child components will have access to the ``useRealm()``,
``useObject()``, and ``useQuery()`` hooks.

Usage
~~~~~
Import the ``Context`` object that you created. In the example below, the
Context object, called TaskContext, refers to the Realm ``Context`` of
the Task. :mdn:`Destructure
<Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#object_destructuring>`
the ``TaskContext`` object to get its hooks. 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/expo/App.codeblock.get-access-to-the-hooks.tsx
    :language: typescript

useRealm
````````
The ``useRealm()`` hook returns the opened {+realm+} instance.

The ``handleAddTask()`` method of the ``App`` component writes to the realm
returned by the ``useRealm()`` hook in the following example.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/expo/App.codeblock.example-userealm-hook-usage.tsx
    :language: typescript

The :js-sdk:`Realm.create() <Realm.html#create>` call invokes the ``Task.generate()`` method defined in the ``Task`` class.  This method instantiates
a JavaScript object with default values for the ``_id``, ``isComplete``, and
``createdAt`` properties.

.. seealso::
  
   :ref:`write to a realm <react-native-write-operations>`


useObject
`````````
The ``useObject()`` hook returns a {+service-short+} object for a given
:ref:`primary key <react-native-primary-keys>`. You can invoke it with the class
model definition (this will add types to the returned object in TypeScript) or
the class name as a string and the primary key. The ``useObject()`` method
returns null if the object doesn't exist or you have deleted it.  The hook will
automatically subscribe to updates and re-render the component using the hook on
any change to the object.

In the following example, the ``useObject()`` hook retrieves a ``Task`` object,
and its description is logged to the console.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/expo/App.codeblock.example-useobject-hook-usage.tsx
    :language: typescript

useQuery
````````
The ``useQuery()`` hook returns a collection of realm objects of a given type.
Like ``useObject``, it is either invoked with the Realm model class or the model
name as a string.  The ``useQuery()`` method subscribes to updates to any
objects in the collection and re-renders the component using it on any change.


In the following example, of a ``TaskList`` component, The ``Task``
class is passed to the ``useQuery()`` and the tasks are set as a ``data`` prop
of a `FlatList <https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist>`_ component.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/expo/TaskList.codeblock.tasklist-use-query-example.tsx
    :language: typescript
    :emphasize-lines: 2, 6

.. tip::

   To learn how to render a :ref:`filtered <react-native-filter-results>` or
   :ref:`sorted <react-native-sort-results>` list of tasks, read the :ref:`Read
   & Write Data <react-native-read-and-write-data>` docs.

Summary
-------
- You can set up Realm React on an existing application by installing it through NPM, or on a new application through the Realm Expo template.
- A Realm ``Context`` opens a {+realm+} and contains a ``RealmProvider`` and a set of pre-built hooks. 
- A ``RealmProvider`` provides access to the configured {+realm+} using hooks to display and modify data.
- The pre-built hooks provide functionality like interacting with a {+realm+} and finding {+realm+} object(s).

Overview
--------

You may want to sync changes in the background to display partial data to the
user while the synced realm downloads data from the server, preventing the
user experience from being blocked. We recommend syncing changes in the
background for applications in which the user's device may go offline. To sync
changes in the background, open a synced realm synchronously.

Create a :js-sdk:`OpenRealmBehaviorConfiguration
<Realm.App.Sync.html#~OpenRealmBehaviorConfiguration>` object and set its
``type`` to ``"openImmediately"``.

      :language: javascript

Create a :js-sdk:`Configuration <Realm.html#~Configuration>` object, which must
include the ``sync`` property defining a :js-sdk:`SyncConfiguration
<Realm.App.Sync.html#~SyncConfiguration>` object. Set this
``OpenRealmBehaviorConfiguration`` object as the value for
the ``newRealmFileBehavior`` and ``existingRealmFileBehavior`` fields of the
``SyncConfiguration``.

      :language: javascript

Finally,  call :js-sdk:`Realm.open() <Realm.html#.open>`
to open a synced realm. This will create a sync session and begin
downloading any existing data from the server in the background.

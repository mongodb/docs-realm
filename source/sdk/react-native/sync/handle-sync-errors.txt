Overview
--------

While developing an application that uses Device Sync, you should set an error
handler. This error handler will detect and respond to any failed sync-related
API calls. 

Set an error handler by registering an error callback as part of the :js-sdk:`SyncConfiguration <Realm.App.Sync.html#~SyncConfiguration>`.

@realm/react Reference
======================

:npm:`@realm/react <package/@realm/react>` is an npm package that streamlines
common Realm operations like querying, writing to a realm, and listening to
realm objects. This reduces boilerplate code, like creating your own listeners
and state management.

``@realm/react`` provides access to Realm through a set of providers that have
various hooks. The hooks update React state when the Realm data changes.
This means that components using these hooks rerender on any changes to data
in the realm.

Set Up @realm/react
-------------------

To set up ``@realm/react``, start with a new `bare React Native app 
<https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup#creating-a-new-application>`_ 
or use the :github:`Realm Expo template <expo/examples/tree/master/with-realm>`.

You can also install ``@realm/react`` for existing React Native apps.

.. code:: bash

   npm install realm @realm/react


Add @realm/react to a New App
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can start with a new bare React Native app  or use the :github:`Realm Expo 
template <expo/examples/tree/master/with-realm>`.

The React Native SDK documentation generally assumes that you're using a bare
React Native app and not Expo.

To create a bare React Native app:

#. Follow the `React Native documentation 
   <https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup#creating-a-new-application>`_.
#. Install ``@realm/react``.

   .. code-block:: shell

      npm install @realm/react

To create a new app with ``@realm/react`` and Expo, follow the :ref:`Quick Start
with Expo <react-native-client-bootstrap-with-expo>` documentation.

Add @realm/react to an Existing App
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install ``@realm/react`` on an existing React Native application, run the
following command in your terminal from the root of your application
where your ``package.json`` file is located:

.. code-block:: shell

    npm install @realm/react

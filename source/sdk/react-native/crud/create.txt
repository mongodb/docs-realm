To add a new Realm object to a realm instance, use :js-sdk:`realm.create()
<Realm.html#create>` inside of a write transaction. If the
:ref:`schema <react-native-realm-schema>` includes the object type and the
object conforms to the schema, then Realm stores the object.

In the following example of a ``CreateDogInput`` component, we:

#. Get access to an opened realm instance by calling the ``useRealm()`` hook
   within the component. 
#. Create a component method ``handleAddDog()`` that performs a
   :ref:`write transaction <react-native-write-transactions>`, and creates a new
   ``Dog`` :js-sdk:`object <Realm.Object.html>` based on the TextInput value.
#. Add an `onPress <https://reactnative.dev/docs/handling-touches>`__ event on
   the submit button that calls ``handleAddDog()``.

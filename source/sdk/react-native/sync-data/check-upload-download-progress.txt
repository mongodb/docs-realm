Overview
--------

To check the upload and download progress for a sync session, add a progress
notification using the :js-sdk:`syncSession.addProgressNotification() <Realm.App.Sync.Session.html#.addProgressNotification>` method.

The ``syncSession.addProgressNotification()`` method takes in the following three parameters:

- A ``direction`` parameter. 
  Set to ``"upload"`` to register notifications for uploading data. 
  Set to ``"download"`` to register notifications for downloading data.
- A ``mode`` parameter. Set to ``"reportIndefinitely"`` 
  for the notifications to continue until the callback is unregistered using
  :js-sdk:`syncSession.removeProgressNotification() <Realm.App.Sync.Session.html#.removeProgressNotification>`.
  Set to ``"forCurrentlyOutstandingWork"`` for the notifications to continue
  until only the currently transferable bytes are synced.
- A callback function parameter that has the arguments ``transferred`` and ``transferable``.
  ``transferred`` is the current number of bytes already transferred.
  ``transferable`` is the total number of bytes already transferred
  plus the number of bytes pending transfer.

.. example::

   In the following example, an application developer registers a callback on the ``syncSession`` to
   listen for upload events indefinitely. The developer writes to the realm and
   then unregisters the ``syncSession`` notification callback.

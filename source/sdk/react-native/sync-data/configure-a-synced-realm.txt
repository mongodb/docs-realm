You can configure a realm to automatically synchronize data between many devices
that each have their own local copy of the data. 

For more information about synced realms, including directions on how to set up
sync in an App Services App, see :ref:`Atlas Device Sync Overview <sync>`.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you open a realm with Flexible Sync in a React Native application:

#. :ref:`Configure Flexible Sync on the backend <enable-flexible-sync>`.
   You must configure Flexible Sync in the backend before you can use it with your
   client application.
#. :ref:`Initialize the App client <react-native-connect-to-mongodb-realm-backend-app>`.
#. :ref:`Authenticate a user <react-native-authenticate-users>` in your client project.

Open a Flexible Sync Realm
--------------------------

This section covers Flexible Sync realms. Flexible Sync is the preferred mode for
new apps that use :ref:`Atlas Device Sync <sync>`. 

For information about realms using the older Partition-Based Sync,
refer to :ref:`Partition-Based Sync <react-native-partition-realms>`.

By default, Realm syncs all data from the server before returning.
If you want to sync data in the background, read the :ref:`Open a Synced Realm
While Offline <react-native-open-synced-realm-offline>` section.

Nest <RealmProvider> within <AppProvider> and <UserProvider>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use a Flexible Sync realm with ``@realm/react``, you must nest ``<RealmProvider>``
within ``<UserProvider>``. And ``<UserProvider>`` must be nested in ``<AppProvider>``. 
This ensures that ``<RealmProvider>`` has all of the context it needs, like a 
logged-in user.

Call ``createRealmContext()`` with 
your :js-sdk:`realm configuration <Realm.html#~Configuration>` to access ``RealmProvider`` in the return value.

The following example shows how to use these providers together in your app:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/react-native/ts/configure-realm-sync.test.snippet.configure-realm-sync-full.tsx
   :language: javascript

For more information about configuring and using ``<AppProvider>``, check
out the :ref:`Connect To Atlas App Services page <react-native-app-client-configuration>`.

You can also find information about ``<UserProvider>`` on the
:ref:`Authenticate Users page <react-native-authenticate-users>`.

Configure a Flexible Sync Realm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To configure a Flexible Sync realm, use ``@realm/react``'s ``createRealmContext()`` 
function and its returned ``<RealmProvider>``.

In a ``<RealmProvider>`` that's nested in a ``<UserProvider>``, add a ``sync`` 
property with a :js-sdk:`SyncConfiguration <Realm.App.Sync.html#~SyncConfiguration>` 
object that contains ``flexible: true``.

Note that ``<UserProvider>`` automatically passes an authenticated user
to ``<RealmProvider>``.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/react-native/ts/configure-realm-sync.test.snippet.configure-realm-sync-full.tsx
   :language: javascript

.. important:: Flexible Sync Requires a Subscription

   You can't use a Flexible Sync realm until you add at least one subscription.
   To learn how to add subscriptions, refer to :ref:`<react-native-sync-add-subscription>`.

.. _react-native-open-synced-realm-offline:

Access a Synced Realm While Offline
-----------------------------------

The following subsections show how to use background synchronization to access a
realm while offline. To do this, use a cached user and an
:js-sdk:`OpenRealmBehaviorConfiguration
<Realm.App.Sync.html#~OpenRealmBehaviorConfiguration>` object. 

Within ``<RealmProvider>``'s sync configuration, set the optional ``newRealmFileBehavior`` 
and ``existingRealmFileBehavior`` fields to your ``OpenRealmBehaviorConfiguration`` 
object to enable background synchronization. 

You can open a realm immediately with background sync or after a timeout.

.. note:: Initial login requires a network connection

   When a user signs up for your app, or logs in for the first time with an 
   existing account on a client, the client must have a network connection.
   Checking for cached user credentials lets you open a realm offline, but
   only if the user has previously logged in while online.

.. _react-native-open-immediately-with-background-sync:

Access Immediately with Background Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may want to sync changes in the background to display partial data to the
user while the synced realm downloads data from the server, preventing the
user experience from being blocked. We recommend syncing changes in the
background for applications in which the user's device may go offline. To sync
changes in the background, open a synced realm synchronously.

.. _react-native-open-after-timeout-with-background-sync:

Access After Timeout with Background Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to sync data but you're in an environment where it's uncertain if
the user has an Internet connection, specify a ``timeOut``. This
automatically opens the realm when either: 

- the timeout period elapses.
- the realm has completely downloaded.

If the realm doesn't finish downloading before the timeout, the initial
Sync continues in the background.

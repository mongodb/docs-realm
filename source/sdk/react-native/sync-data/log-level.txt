You can set or change your app's log level to develop or debug your 
application. You might want to change the log level to log different 
amounts of data depending on the app's environment.

Realm React Native SDK vTBD and Later
-------------------------------------

Initialize an instance of a :js-sdk:`Logger <TBD>` 
and define the function to use for logging. The 
:js-sdk:`RLMLogLevel <TBD>` enum represents the different
levels of logging you can configure.

Set a Default Logger and Change Log Levels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can set a logger as the default logger for your app with ``Logger.shared``. 
After you set the default logger, you can change the log level during the app 
lifecycle as needed.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/react-native/TBD
   :language: typescript

.. tip:: Default log levels

   The default log level is ``.info``. To disable all log messages, set the 
   logger to ``Logger.shared.level = .off``. You can adjust logging as needed
   throughout the app lifecycle.

Realm React Native SDK vTBD and Earlier
---------------------------------------

These APIs and their associated types are deprecated in version TBD.

You can set the realm Sync client :js-sdk:`log level
<Realm.App.Sync.html#~LogLevel>` by calling
:js-sdk:`Realm.App.Sync.setLogLevel() <Realm.App.Sync.html#.setLogLevel>` with
your :js-sdk:`Realm.App <Realm.App.html>`.

.. example::

   In the following example, an application developer sets the sync client
   log level to ``"debug"``.

You can use :ref:`Data Ingest <optimize-data-ingest>` to stream
data from the client application to a Flexible Sync-enabled Atlas App Services
App.

Data Ingest is optimized to provide performance improvements for heavy
client-side *insert-only* workloads.

Example
~~~~~~~
   
In the following example of a retail app, a client requires large amounts of
invoice data to be recorded rapidly by store employees. The client specifies
that invoice data does not need to be read after employees have recorded it.

To satisfy this requirement, define an invoice collection with the
``asymmetric`` property set to ``true``. This object cannot be read because
it only sends data in one direction: to the backend of your App Services App.

To learn more about Data Ingest, read :ref:`Optimize Sync with Data Ingest
<optimize-data-ingest>`.

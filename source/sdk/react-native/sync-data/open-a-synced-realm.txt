Overview
--------

You can configure a realm to automatically synchronize data between many devices
that each have their own local copy of the data. Synced realms use a different
configuration than local-only realms and require an Atlas App Services backend to handle
the synchronization process.

Applications can always create, modify, and delete synced realm objects locally,
even when offline. Whenever a network connection is available, the Realm SDK
opens a connection to an application server and syncs changes to and from other
clients. The :ref:`Atlas Device Sync protocol <sync-protocol>` and server-side
operational transforms guarantee that all fully synced instances of a realm see
exactly the same data, even if some changes occurred offline and/or were
received out of order.

.. tip:: Learn How to Configure and Use Sync
   
   For more information on synced realms, including directions on how to set up
   sync in an App Services App, see :ref:`Atlas Device Sync Overview <sync>`.

Open a Synced Realm
-------------------

You can open a Synced realm with a Flexible Sync or Partition-Based Sync. If
you have not yet decided or are unsure which to use, read the :ref:`Choose Your
Sync Mode <sync-modes>` page.

By default, Realm syncs all data from the server before returning.
If you want to sync data in the background, read the :ref:`Open a Synced Realm
While Offline <react-native-open-synced-realm-offline>` section.

.. _react-native-flexible-sync-open-realm:

Open a Flexible Synced Realm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To open a realm using Flexible Sync, call :js-sdk:`Realm.open() <Realm.html#.open>`. 
Pass in a :js-sdk:`Configuration <Realm.html#~Configuration>`
object, which must include the ``sync`` property defining a 
:js-sdk:`SyncConfiguration <Realm.App.Sync.html#~SyncConfiguration>` object. 
In the SyncConfiguration, you must include include a ``user`` and ``flexible:true``.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/flexible-sync.snippet.open-flexible-sync-realm.js
   :language: javascript

.. important:: Flexible Sync Requires a Subscription

   You can't use a Flexible Sync realm until you add at least one subscription.
   To learn how to add subscriptions, see: :ref:`<react-native-sync-add-subscription>`.

.. _react-native-partition-sync-open-realm:

Open a Partition-Based Synced Realm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/node-open-a-synced-realm.rst

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/open-and-close-a-realm.snippet.open-synced-realm-online-with-car-schema.js
   :language: javascript

.. _react-native-open-synced-realm-offline:

Open a Synced Realm While Offline
---------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/offline-login.rst

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/open-and-close-a-realm.snippet.use-cached-user-to-login.js
   :language: javascript

The following subsections show how to use background synchronization to access a
realm while offline. To do this, use the cached user and an
:js-sdk:`OpenRealmBehaviorConfiguration
<Realm.App.Sync.html#~OpenRealmBehaviorConfiguration>` object. 

Within your Sync Configuration, set the optional ``newRealmFileBehavior`` and
``existingRealmFileBehavior`` fields to your ``OpenRealmBehaviorConfiguration`` object
to enable background synchronization. 

.. important:: Offline Login is Supported for Both Flexible and Partition-Based Sync Configurations

   You can open a realm immediately with background sync or after a timeout
   elapses using either Flexible and Partition-Based Sync.

.. _react-native-open-immediately-with-background-sync:

Open Immediately with Background Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may want to sync changes in the background to display partial data to the
user while the synced realm downloads data from the server, preventing the
user experience from being blocked. We recommend syncing changes in the
background for applications in which the user's device may go offline. To sync
changes in the background, open a synced realm synchronously.

Create a :js-sdk:`OpenRealmBehaviorConfiguration
<Realm.App.Sync.html#~OpenRealmBehaviorConfiguration>` object and set its
``type`` to ``"openImmediately"``. 

Next, create a :js-sdk:`Configuration <Realm.html#~Configuration>` object, which must
include the ``sync`` property defining a :js-sdk:`SyncConfiguration
<Realm.App.Sync.html#~SyncConfiguration>` object. Set this
``OpenRealmBehaviorConfiguration`` object as the value for
the ``newRealmFileBehavior`` and ``existingRealmFileBehavior`` fields of the
``SyncConfiguration``. 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/open-and-close-a-realm.snippet.open-synced-realm-with-background-sync.js
      :language: javascript

.. _react-native-open-after-timeout-with-background-sync:

Open After Timeout with Background Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to sync data but you're in an environment where it's uncertain if
the user has an Internet connection, specify a ``timeOut``. This
automatically opens the realm when either: 

- the timeout period elapses.
- the realm has completely downloaded.

If the realm doesn't finish downloading before the timeout, the initial
Sync continues in the background.

  :language: javascript

.. _react-native-open-existing-realm-different-configuration:
.. _react-native-copy-data-and-open-new-realm:

Copy Data and Open a New Realm
------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 10.14.0

To copy data from an existing realm to a new realm with different
configuration options, pass the new configuration the
:js-sdk:`Realm.writeCopyTo() <Realm.html#writeCopyTo>` method.

.. include:: /includes/note-writecopy-pbs-only.rst

In the new realm's configuration, you *must* specify the ``path``. 

If you write the copied realm to a realm file that already exists, the data is written object by object.
The copy operation replaces objects if there already exists objects for given primary keys.
The schemas of the realm you copy and the realm you are writing to must be 
compatible for the copy operation to succeed.
Only objects in the schemas of both configurations are copied over.

The configuration change can include modifications to :js-sdk:`SyncConfiguration
<Realm.App.Sync.html#~SyncConfiguration>`: 

- Local realm to synced realm
- Synced Realm to local realm

The configuration change can also include changes to ``encryptionKey`` 
property of the ``Configuration``: 

- Encrypted realm to unencrypted realm
- Unencrypted realm to encrypted realm

.. example:: Convert Local Realm to Synced Realm

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/open-and-close-a-realm.snippet.open-local-as-synced.js
      :language: javascript
      :emphasize-lines: 15-16

You can also combine changes to configuration. For example, you can open a
local encrypted realm as a synced unencrypted realm or a unencrypted synced realm
as an encrypted synced realm.

.. example:: Convert Synced Encrypted to Local Unencrypted Realm

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/open-and-close-a-realm.snippet.sync-encrypted-to-local-unencrypted.js

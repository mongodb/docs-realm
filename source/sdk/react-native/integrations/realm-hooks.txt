Overview
--------
Realm Hooks provides an easy-to-use API to perform common Realm operations, such
as querying or writing to a realm and listening to realm objects.

Using Realm React Hooks allows you to avoid creating boilerplate code, such as
creating your own listeners and state management. Realm React Hooks provides a
set of React Hooks, which return state-aware Realm data. This means that React
components using the Realm React Hooks will re-render whenever you change the
Realm data.

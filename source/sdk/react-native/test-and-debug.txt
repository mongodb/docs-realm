Testing
-------

You can test the Realm React Native SDK with popular React Native testing libraries
like `Jest <https://jestjs.io/>`__, `Jasmine <https://jasmine.github.io/>`__,
and `Mocha <https://mochajs.org/>`__.

.. seealso::

   `Official React Native Testing Documentation <https://reactnative.dev/docs/testing-overview>`__

Clean Up Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When testing the Realm React Native SDK, you must close realms with
:js-sdk:`Realm.close() <Realm.html#close>` after you're done with them to prevent memory leaks.

You should also delete the realm file  with :js-sdk:`Realm.deleteFile() <Realm.html#.deleteFile>`
during clean up to keep your tests idempotent.

The below example uses the Jest testing framework. It uses Jest's built-in ``beforeEach()``
and ``afterEach()`` hooks for test set up and tear down, respectively.

Debugging
---------

Realm provides differing levels of support for various React Native debuggers.

.. seealso::

   `Official React Native Debugging Documentation <https://reactnative.dev/docs/debugging>`__

Safari Developer Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're a macOS user, you can use Safari Developer Tools to debug the iOS version
of your React Native app with Realm.

To set up Safari Developer Tools with your React Native app, refer to
`the official documentation <https://reactnative.dev/docs/debugging#safari-developer-tools>`__.

Flipper
~~~~~~~

`Flipper <https://fbflipper.com/>`__ is a platform for debugging React Native apps.
You can currently only only use Flipper with the `Realm React Native SDK Hermes release
<https://github.com/realm/realm-js/issues/3940>`__.
`Hermes <https://hermesengine.dev/>`__ is a JavaScript engine optimized for React Native.


Chrome Developer Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While Realm works with the `Chrome Developer Tools on React Native
<https://reactnative.dev/docs/debugging#chrome-developer-tools>`__,
the debugger's performance degrades significantly
when using it with Realm.
This is due to the blocking nature of the RPC calls made by Realm.

If you are able, you should use the Safari Developer Tools or Flipper
instead of the Chrome Developer Tools.

About the Examples on this Page
-------------------------------
The examples on this page use the following schemas:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/read-and-write-data.snippet.dog-schema-crud.js
  :language: javascript

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/read-and-write-data.snippet.person-schema-crud.js
  :language: javascript

.. _react-native-update-an-object:

Update an Object
----------------

You can add, modify, or delete properties of a Realm object inside
of a write transaction in the same way that you would update any other
JavaScript object.

.. tip:: Update Related and Embedded Objects
   
   To update a property of an :ref:`embedded object <react-native-embedded-objects>` or
   a :ref:`related object <react-native-client-relationships>`, modify the property with
   :mdn:`dot-notation or bracket-notation
   <Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Property_accessors>` as if it were in a
   regular, nested object.

.. _react-native-upsert-an-object:

Upsert an Object
----------------

To upsert an object, call :js-sdk:`Realm.create() <Realm.html#create>` with the
update mode set to ``modified``. The operation either inserts a new object with
the given primary key or updates an existing object that already has that
primary key.

.. _react-native-bulk-update:

Bulk Update a Collection
------------------------

To apply an update to a collection of objects, iterate through the collection
(e.g. with :mdn:`for...of
<Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of>`). In the loop, update each object individually:

.. note:: Inverse Relationships

   Thanks to an :ref:`inverse relationship <react-native-inverse-relationship>` from
   ``Dog.owner`` to ``Person.dogs``, Realm Database automatically updates
   Ali's list of dogs whenever we set her as a puppy's owner.

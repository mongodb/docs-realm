Delete an Object
----------------

To delete an object from a realm, pass the object to :js-sdk:`Realm.delete()
<Realm.html#delete>` inside of a write transaction.

.. important:: Do not use objects after delete
   
   You cannot access or modify an object after you have deleted it from a Realm.
   If you try to use a deleted object, Realm Database throws an error.

Delete Multiple Objects
-----------------------

To delete a collection of objects from a realm, pass the collection to
:js-sdk:`Realm.delete() <Realm.html#delete>` inside of a write transaction.

To delete all objects of a given object type from a realm, pass
``Realm.objects(<ObjectType>)`` to the :js-sdk:`Realm.delete()
<Realm.html#delete>` method inside of a write transaction.

Delete All Objects in a Realm
-----------------------------

To delete **all** objects from the realm, call :js-sdk:`Realm.deleteAll()
<Realm.html#deleteAll>` inside of a write transaction. This clears the realm
of all object instances but does not affect the realm's schema.

.. tip:: Delete All In Development
   
   :js-sdk:`Realm.deleteAll() <Realm.html#deleteAll>` is a useful method to
   quickly clear out your realm in the course of development. For example,
   rather than writing a migration to update objects to a new schema, it may be
   faster to delete and then re-generate the objects with the app itself.

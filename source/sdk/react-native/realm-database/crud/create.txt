Create a New Object
-------------------

To add an object to a realm, instantiate it as you would any other object and
then use the :mdn:`new <Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new>` operator to
create a new realm object inside of a write transaction. If the realm's
:ref:`schema <react-native-realm-schema>` includes the object type and the
object conforms to the schema, then Realm stores the object, which is now
*managed* by the realm.

In the following example of a ``CreateDogInput`` component, we:

#. Get access to an open realm instance by calling the ``useRealm()`` hook within the component. 
#. Create a component method ``handleAddItem()`` that performs a :ref:`write transaction <react-native-write-transactions>`, and creates a new ``Dog`` :js-sdk:`object <Realm.Object.html>` based on the TextInput value.
#. Add an `onPress <https://reactnative.dev/docs/handling-touches>`__ event on the submit button that calls ``handleAddItem()``

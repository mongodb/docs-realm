Create a New Object
-------------------

Before you can add an object to a realm, get an instance of your realm by
calling the ``useRealm()`` hook. 

To add an object to a realm, instantiate it as you would any other object
and then pass it to :js-sdk:`Realm.create() <Realm.html#create>` inside of a
write transaction. If the realm's :ref:`schema <react-native-realm-schema>` includes
the object type and the object conforms to the schema, then Realm
stores the object, which is now *managed* by the realm.

In the following example of a ``CreateDogInput`` functional component,   an
application user enters the dog's name in the `TextInput
<https://reactnative.dev/docs/textinput>`__ component and hits the submit
`button <https://reactnative.dev/docs/button>`__, calling a function that writes
a new Dog object to the realm instance.

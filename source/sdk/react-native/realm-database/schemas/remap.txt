Overview
--------

To use a different property name in your code than is stored in
Realm Database, set ``mapTo`` to the name of the property as it appears in
your code.

.. example::
   
   A developer opens a realm using the following ``Dog`` object schema.
   Realm Database stores each dog's first name with the snake case
   ``first_name`` property. The schema maps the property to ``firstName`` for
   objects used in JavaScript code.

Overview
--------
The mixed data type is a realm property type that can hold any valid Realm data type except a collection.
You can create collections (lists, sets, and dictionaries) of type ``mixed``, but a ``mixed`` itself 
cannot be a collection. Properties using the mixed data type can also hold null values.

.. note::

   The mixed data type is indexable, but you can't use it as a primary key.
   Because null is a permitted value, you can't declare a Mixed property as
   optional.

Realm Object Models
-------------------
To :ref:`set a property of your object model
<react-native-define-a-realm-object-schema>` as ``Mixed``, set the property's type to
"``mixed``".

Create an Object With a Mixed Value
-----------------------------------
Create an object with a mixed value by running the :js-sdk:`realm.create()
<Realm.html#create>` method within a :ref:`write transaction
<react-native-write-transactions>`.

Example
~~~~~~~

In the following ``CreateCatsInput`` example, we create several ``Cat`` realm
objects with a ``mixed`` type for the ``birthDate`` field. 

The ``CreateCatsInput`` component does the following:

- Get access to the opened realm instance by calling the ``useRealm()`` hook. 
- Use React's `useEffect <https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html>`__ hook to call an anonymous function only once by passing ``useEffect`` an `empty dependency array <https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html#tip-optimizing-performance-by-skipping-effects>`__ as a second argument.
- Within the anonymous function, we create four different ``Cat`` objects by using the :mdn:`new <Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new>` operator to create a new realm object within a write transaction. Each of the ``Cat`` objects uses a different data type for the ``birthDate`` property. 
- Use the ``useQuery()`` hook to retrieve all ``Cat`` objects.
- `Map <https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html>`__ through the cats to render a list of ``Text`` components displaying each cat's ``name`` and ``birthDate``.

Query for Objects with a Mixed Value
------------------------------------
To query for objects with a mixed value, run the 
:js-sdk:`Collection.filtered() <Realm.Collection.html#filtered>` method and
pass in a :ref:`filter <react-native-filter-queries>` for a non-mixed field. You can
then print the value of the mixed property or the entire object itself.

Example
~~~~~~~

In the following ``CatInfoCard`` example, we query for a ``Cat`` object using the
cat's name.

The ``CatInfoCard`` component does the following:

- Get all ``Cat`` objects by passing the ``Cat`` class to the ``useQuery()`` hook, and then use ``filtered()`` to filter the results to receive only the cats whose name match the name passed as a prop. We then get the first matching cat and store it as a const variable. 
- Use dot notation to retrieve the mixed property, ``birthDate``. 
- Display the cat's name and birthdate in the render method if the cat was found. If there is no cat that matches the name passed into the component as a prop, we render text that says "Cat not found".

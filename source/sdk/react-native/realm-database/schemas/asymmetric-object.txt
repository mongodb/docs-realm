Overview
--------

If you are using Flexible Sync and need to sync a collection unidirectionally
from your device to your Atlas database, you can set the ``asymmetric`` property
on your object schema.

Example
~~~~~~~
   
In the following example of a retail app, the client requires large amounts of
invoice data to be recorded rapidly by store employees. The client specifies
that invoice data does not need to be read after employees have recorded it. To
satisfy this requirement, the application developer defines an invoice
collection with its ``asymmetric`` property set to ``true``.

.. note:: Attempting to Read Asymmetric Sync Objects

   Asymmetric Sync objects cannot be read. If you attempt to query an Asymmetric Sync object, you
   will get the following error: "Error: You cannot query an asymmetric class.".

Overview
--------

Realm allows you to define explicit relationships between the types of
objects in an App. A relationship is an object property that references
another Realm object type. You can define
relationships by setting an object's property to another object type
in the :ref:`property schema <react-native-realm-schema>`.

Relationships are direct references to other objects in a realm.
You don't need bridge tables or joins to define a relationship like you
would in a relational database. 
Instead you can access related objects by reading and writing to the property
that defines the relationship.

Realm Database executes read operations lazily as they come in.
Querying a relationship is just as performant as reading a regular property.

There are three primary types of relationships between objects:

- :ref:`One-to-One Relationship <react-native-to-one-relationship>`
- :ref:`One-to-Many Relationship <react-native-to-many-relationship>`
- :ref:`Inverse Relationship <react-native-inverse-relationship>`

.. note:: Realm vs Other Databases
   
   Objects often contain direct references to other objects.
   When working with objects and references,
   you often copy from database storage into application memory.
   This situation leaves the developer with a choice of what to copy into memory:
   
   - You can copy the entire referenced object ahead of time.
     This means that all referenced data is always available quickly,
     but can use up a lot of resources. Depending on the amount of available memory
     this may not be viable.
   
   - You can copy only a foreign key value for each object ahead of time that you
     can use to query the full object if it's needed.
     These referenced lookups are memory-efficient.
     However, they require more query code and too many lookups can slow your application down.
   
   Realm's query architecture avoids the tradeoff between memory usage and computational overhead.
   Instead, Realm queries can directly reference :ref:`related objects
   <react-native-relationships>` and their properties on disk.

To-One Relationship
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **to-one** relationship means that an object is related to no more than 
one other object in an :ref:`object schema <react-native-object-schemas>`. 
To define a to-one relationship, specify the property type as the related
Realm object type.


.. example::

   An application could use the following object schemas to indicate
   that a Person may own a single Dog:
   
 
   .. literalinclude:: /examples/Relationships/ToOne/ToOne.js
      :language: javascript
      :emphasize-lines: 6

.. _react-native-to-many-relationship:
.. _react-native-define-a-to-many-relationship-property:

To-Many Relationship
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **to-many** relationship means that an object is related in a specific
way to multiple objects. 
To define a to-many relationship, specify a property where the type is a list
or array of the related Realm object type in its
:ref:`object schema <react-native-object-schemas>`.


.. example::
   
   An application could use the following object schemas to indicate
   that a Person may own multiple Dogs:
   
   .. literalinclude:: /examples/Relationships/ToMany/ToMany.js
      :language: javascript
      :emphasize-lines: 6

.. _react-native-inverse-relationship:
.. _react-native-define-an-inverse-relationship-property:

Inverse Relationship
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An inverse relationship links an object back to any other objects that refer
to it in a defined to-one or to-many relationship.
Relationship definitions are unidirectional by default.
You must explicitly define a property in the object's model as an inverse relationship.

For example, the to-many relationship "User has many Tasks" does not automatically
create the inverse relationship "Task belongs to User".
If you don't specify the inverse relationship in the object model,
you need to run a separate query to look up the user assigned to a task.

To define an inverse relationship, define a ``linkingObjects`` property in your
object model. ``linkingObjects`` specifies the object type and
property name of the relationship that it inverts.

You cannot manually set the value of an inverse relationship property.
Realm Database automatically updates implicit relationships whenever 
you add or remove a related object.

.. example::
   
   An application could use the following object schemas to indicate: 
   
   #. A User may be assigned many Tasks. 
   #. Each Task should automatically keep track of which User it's assigned to.
   
   The User object's tasks property is defined as a to-many relationship with Task objects.
   It contains all of a given user's assigned tasks. 
     
   The Task object's assignee property inverts this relationship.
   Assignee automatically updates to refer back to any User object that contains
   the Task in its tasks property.

.. _react-native-inverse-relationship-dynamically:

Dynamically Obtain an Inversely Linked Object
`````````````````````````````````````````````
You can dynamically retrieve an object with an inverse relationship without
defining a ``linkingObjects`` type in its schema. Remove the
``linkingObjects`` type from your schema, so your schemas look like a standard
**to-many** relationship. When you need to retrieve the linked object, call the
:js-sdk:`Realm.Object.linkingObjects() <Realm.Object.html#linkingObjects>`
query.

.. example::
   
   In the following continuation from the inverse relationship example, we have removed the
   ``assignee`` field with type 'linkingObjects' from the Task schema. An application developer
   creates several users and task objects, and the application pushes the newly created tasks into a 
   user's task field. 
   
   To find the user who owns a specific task object, the developer calls the
   ``task.linkingObjects()`` method and passes the "User" class name and "tasks" field as parameters.

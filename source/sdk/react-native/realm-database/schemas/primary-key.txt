Overview
--------

To specify a property as an object type's primary key, set the schema's
``primaryKey`` field to the property name.

.. note::
   
   A **primary key** is a property that uniquely identifies an
   object. Realm Database automatically :ref:`indexes <react-native-indexes>`
   primary key properties, which allows you to efficiently read and modify
   objects based on their primary key.
   
   If an object type has a primary key, then all objects of that type must
   include the primary key property with a value that is unique among objects of
   the same type in a realm. An object type may have at most one primary
   key. You cannot change the primary key property for an object type after any
   object of that type is added to a realm and you cannot modify an object's
   primary key value.

.. example::
   
   The following ``Task`` object schema specifies the ``_id`` property as its
   primary key.

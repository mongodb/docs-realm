Overview
--------
You can use the ``dictionary`` data type to manage a collection of unique String
keys paired with values. The ``dictionary`` data maps to the Javascript
:mdn:`Object <Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object>` type. 

Realm Object Models
-------------------

To define a dictionary of mixed values in your schema, set the data type
of your field to an empty object, ``"{}"``. Alternatively, add the data type before the brackets to create a
dictionary with values of a specific type. For instance, ``"int{}"`` to specify that dictionary values must be
integers or ``"string{}"`` to specify that dictionary values must be strings.

Create an Object with a Dictionary Value
----------------------------------------

To create an object with a dictionary value, use the :mdn:`new
<Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new>` operator within a :ref:`write
transaction <react-native-write-transactions>`. 

Example
~~~~~~~

In the following ``CreateHomeOwner`` example, we create a new object with a dictionary property.

The ``CreateHomeOwner`` component does the following:

- Create React `state <https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#state>`__ that represents the homeowner's name and address, respectively.
- Get access to an open realm instance by calling the ``useRealm()`` hook within the component.
- Create a component method ``SubmitHomeOwner()`` that performs a write transaction and creates a new ``HomeOwner`` object based on the ``TextInput`` values for the homeowner's name and address, respectively.
- Add an `onPress <https://reactnative.dev/docs/handling-touches>`__ event on the submit button that calls ``SubmitHomeOwner()``

Query for Objects with a Dictionary Property
--------------------------------------------
To filter a query, run :js-sdk:`collection.filtered()
<Realm.Collection.html#filtered>` to specify a subset of results based on the
value(s) of one or more object properties. You can specify results based on the value of a 
dictionary's properties by using :mdn:`bracket notation <Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Property_accessors>`.

You can also determine whether a results collection has a certain key or value
by using ``<dictionary>.@keys`` or ``<dictionary>.@values``. For instance, if
you had a ``HomeOwner`` collection with a nested ``home`` dictionary, you could
return all ``HomeOwner`` objects with a ``home`` with a ``"price"`` property by
running the query: ``home.@keys = "price"``.

Example
~~~~~~~

In the following ``HomeList`` example, we query for objects that have dictionary properties.

The ``HomeList`` component does the following:

- Performs a query for all homeowners by passing the ``HomeOwner`` class to the ``useQuery`` hook.
- Performs a query for homeowners with a listed price by passing ``collection.filtered()`` the query: ``home.@keys = "price"``.
- Performs a query for the summer hill house by running ``collection.filtered()`` using bracket notation to find the first homeowner with an address set to "Summerhill St." and getting their home by using dot syntax. 
- Performs a query for all homeowners with any field with a value of red by passing ``collection.filtered()`` the query: ``'home.@values = "red"'``. We then get the first homeowner's home.
- Display the results of our queries in the UI by rendering information about the homes

Update a Dictionary
-------------------
Update a dictionary's property by using the :js-sdk:`dictionary.set() <Realm.Dictionary.html#set>` method or dot notation to set its property to a new value.

Example
~~~~~~~

In the following ``UpdateHome`` example, we update a dictionary's property. 

The ``UpdateHome`` component does the following:

- Create a React `state <https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#state>`__ variable that represents the home address.
- Get access to an opened realm instance by calling the ``useRealm()`` hook within the component. 
- Create a component method ``updateAddress()`` that performs a write transaction and uses ``dictionary.set()`` to set the home's address to the value of the ``address`` state variable. It also uses dot syntax to set the ``yearRenovated`` to ``2004``.
- Render a ``TextInput`` that displays and changes the ``address`` state variable.
- Add an `onPress <https://reactnative.dev/docs/handling-touches>`__ event on the "Update Address" button that calls ``updateAddress()``

Delete Members of a Dictionary
------------------------------
To delete members of a dictionary, use the :js-sdk:`dictionary.remove() <Realm.Dictionary.html#remove>` method with an array of properties to remove from the dictionary.

Example
~~~~~~~

In the following ``HomeInfo`` example, we delete members of a dictionary.

The ``HomeInfo`` component does the following:

- Get access to an open realm instance by calling the ``useRealm()`` hook within the component. 
- Retrieve the first homeowner that matches the name passed into the component as a prop. We do this by getting the first value returned from the query: ``useQuery(HomeOwner).filtered(`name == '${homeOwnerName}'`)``.
- Create a component method ``deleteExtraHomeInfo()`` that performs a write transaction and calls ``dictionary.remove()`` to remove the ``yearRenovated`` and ``color`` properties.
- Render the homeowner's name and home address in the UI.
- Add an `onPress <https://reactnative.dev/docs/handling-touches>`__ event on the "Delete extra home info" button that calls ``deleteExtraHomeInfo()``.

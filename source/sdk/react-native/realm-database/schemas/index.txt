Overview
--------

Realm supports indexing for string, integer, boolean, ``Date``, ``UUID``, and ``ObjectId``
properties. To define an index for a given property, set ``indexed`` to
``true``.

.. note::

   An **index** significantly increases the speed of certain read operations at
   the cost of  slightly slower write times and additional storage and memory
   overhead. Realm Database stores indexes on disk, which makes your realm files
   larger. Each index entry is a minimum of 12 bytes. The ordering of the index
   entries supports efficient equality matches and range-based query operations. 
   
   It's best to only add indexes when optimizing the read performance for
   specific situations.

.. example::
   
   The following ``Book`` object schema defines an index on the ``name``
   property.

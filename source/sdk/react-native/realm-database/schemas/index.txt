Overview
--------

If you frequently run :ref:`read operations <react-native-read-operations>` 
based on a specific property, you can index the property to optimize 
performance. Realm supports indexing for string, integer, boolean, ``Date``, 
``UUID``, and ``ObjectId`` properties. 

.. note::

   An **index** significantly increases the speed of certain read operations at
   the cost of slightly slower write times and additional storage and memory
   overhead. Realm Database stores indexes on disk, which makes your realm files
   larger. Each index entry is a minimum of 12 bytes. The ordering of the index
   entries supports efficient equality matches and range-based query operations. 

Usage
-----
To index a given property, set the property's ``indexed`` field to ``true``.

Example
~~~~~~~

In the following example of a ``Book`` class, we define an index on the ``name``
property.

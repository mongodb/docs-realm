The ``@realm/react`` library exposes realms throughout your application with 
`React Context objects <https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html>`__ and Provider 
components. You can access realms with React hooks.

To open a local realm, create a Context with the realm's configuration. The 
Context exports a ``RealmProvider`` component that exposes a realm with the 
configuration passed to the Context. All child components of the ``RealmProvider`` 
can access the realm using hooks.

To learn how to open a realm using Device Sync, refer to 
:ref:`Open a Synced Realm <react-native-open-a-synced-realm>`.

Create a Context Object with ``createRealmContext``
---------------------------------------------------

By passing a :js-sdk:`Configuration <Realm.html#~Configuration>` object to 
``createRealmContext``, you can create a Context object that contains an open 
realm and some hooks that give you access to the realm.

The following example creates and exports a Context object so that it can be used elsewhere.

Configure a Realm with ``<RealmProvider>``
------------------------------------------

``<RealmProvider>`` is a wrapper that exposes a Context with Realm Database to 
its child components. All child components inside ``<RealmProvider>`` have access 
to hooks that let you read, write, and update data. This is what a local-only 
realm wrapper might look like:

   :language: javascript

Open a Synced Realm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To open a realm that synchronizes data with Atlas using Device Sync,
refer to :ref:`Open a Synced Realm <react-native-open-a-synced-realm>`.

Open an In-Memory Realm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a realm that runs entirely in memory without being written to a file,
add ``inMemory: true`` to your :js-sdk:`Realm.Configuration
<Realm.html#~Configuration>` object:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/react-native/ts/index.snippet.in-memory-realm.ts
   :language: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 3

In-memory realms may use disk space if memory is running low, but files created 
by an in-memory realm are deleted when you close the realm.

Open One or More Realms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can open more than one realm at a time by creating additional Contexts and ``RealmProvider`` components.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/react-native/ts/configure-realm-sync.test.snippet.two-realm-contexts.tsx
   :language: javascript

Key Concept: Realm Files
------------------------

Realm Database stores a binary encoded version of every object and type in a
realm in a single ``.realm`` file. The file is located at a specific path that
you define when you open the realm.

.. tip:: Implement Compacting in Your Production Application

   Every production application should implement a ``shouldCompactOnLaunch`` 
   callback to periodically reduce the realm file size.

.. note:: Auxiliary Realm Files
   
   Realm Database creates additional files for each realm.
   To learn more about these files, see :ref:`Realm Database Internals <react-native-realm-database>`.

.. warning:: Use Caution When Deleting Realm Files
   
   In some circumstances, such as a client reset scenario, you might need to
   delete a realm file and its auxiliary files.
   
   If you delete a realm file or any of its auxiliary files while one or
   more instances of the realm are open, you might corrupt the realm or
   disrupt :ref:`sync <sync>`.
   
   You may safely delete these files when all instances of a realm are
   closed. Before you delete a realm file, make sure that you back up any
   important objects as you will lose all unsynced data in the realm.

You can query a realm to find objects based on their type and the values of
their properties. Objects and queries always reflect the latest state of an
object and emit :ref:`notifications <react-native-change-notifications>` that can
update your app whenever data changes.

.. tip:: Learn How to Define and Run Queries
   
   For code examples that show how to read and filter Realm objects with the
   React Native SDK, see :ref:`Read Operations <react-native-read-operations>`.

.. _react-native-live-objects:

Live Objects
------------

Data in Realm is *live*, which means that an object always reflects
its most recent saved state and read operations never block. Objects
automatically update in response to changes, so you can see up-to-date data in
your application without running a new query.

.. note:: Memory-mapped Realm Objects

   Realm can support live objects because it :wikipedia:`memory-maps
   <Memory-mapped_file>` objects in your application directly to data stored in
   the :ref:`realm file <react-native-realm-file>` instead of a copy of the data
   stored in memory.

Collections
-----------

A results collection represents all objects in a realm that match a query
operation. In general you can work with a collection like a regular JavaScript
array but collections don't actually hold matching Realm objects in memory.
Instead they reference the matched objects, which themselves map directly to data
in the realm file.

.. note:: Pagination & Limits
   
   Some queries only need to access a subset of all objects that match the query.
   Realm's lazy-loaded collections only fetch objects when you actually
   access them, so you do not need any special mechanism to limit query results.
   
   For example, if you only want to find 10 matching objects at a time (such as
   in a paged product catalog) you can just access ten elements of the results
   collection. To advance to the next page, access the next ten elements of the
   results collection starting at the index immediately following the last
   element of the previous page.

.. _react-native-change-notifications:

Change Notifications
--------------------

Realm objects and collections always reflect the latest state of your data when
you read them. Realm emits a change notification whenever the state of your data
changes, which lets you reactively update your app in response to committed
:ref:`write transaction <react-native-write-transactions>`.

You can register three types of notification listeners:

- A **realm listener** fires whenever any object in a realm changes.
- A **collection listener** fires whenever a specific query matches a new set of objects or when any matched object changes.
- An **object listener** fires whenever a specific object is deleted or has one or more properties modified.

.. tip:: Learn How to React to Changes
   
   For code examples that show how to define, register, and clean up change
   notification listeners with the React Native SDK, see :ref:`React to Changes
   <react-native-react-to-changes>`.

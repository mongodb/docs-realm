Overview
--------

When updating your object schema, you must increment the schema version 
and perform a migration. 

If your schema update adds optional properties or removes properties, 
Realm Database can perform the migration automatically. You only need to 
increment the ``schemaVersion``. 

For more complex schema updates, you must also manually specify the migration logic 
in a ``migration`` function. This might include changes such as:

- Adding required properties that must be populated with default values
- Combining fields
- Renaming a field
- Changing a field's type
- Converting from an object to an embedded object

.. tip:: Bypass Migration During Development

   When developing or debugging your application, you may prefer to delete the
   realm instead of migrating it. Use the
   :js-sdk:`Configuration.deleteRealmIfMigrationNeeded
   <Realm.html#~Configuration>` property to delete the database automatically
   when a schema mismatch requires a migration. 

   Never release an app to production with this property set to ``true``.

.. _react-native-schema-version:

Key Concept: Schema Version
---------------------------

A **schema version** identifies the state of a :ref:`realm schema
<react-native-realm-schema>` at some point in time. Realm Database tracks the
schema version of each realm and uses it to map the objects in each
realm to the correct schema.

Schema versions are ascending integers you can include in the realm
configuration. If a client application does not specify a version number, the
realm defaults to version ``0``.

.. important:: Increment Versions Monotonically
   
   :ref:`Migrations <react-native-migrations>` must update a realm to a higher 
   schema version. Realm Database will throw an error if a client application 
   uses a schema version that is lower than the realm's current version or if 
   the specified schema version is the same as the realm's current version but 
   includes a different schema.

.. _react-native-migrations:

Key Concept: Migrations
-----------------------

A **migration** is a function that updates a realm and any objects it
contains from one :ref:`schema version <react-native-schema-version>` to a newer
version. Migrations give you the flexibility to change your object schemas over
time to accommodate new features and refactors.

When you create a :js-sdk:`Configuration
<Realm.html#~Configuration>` with schema version greater than the
realm's current version, Realm runs a migration function that you define.
The function has access to the realm's version number and incrementally
updates objects in the realm to conform to the new schema.

Realm automatically migrates certain changes, such as new and deleted
properties, but does not automatically set values for new properties unless the
updated object schema specifies a default value. You can define additional logic
in the migration function to further customize property values.

Automatically Update Schema
---------------------------

.. _react-native-add-a-property:

Add a Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add a property to a schema, add the new property to the object's class and
set a ``schemaVersion`` of the ``RealmConfiguration`` object.

.. example::
   
   A realm using :ref:`schema version
   <react-native-schema-version>` ``1`` has a ``Person`` object type with a
   ``firstName``, and ``lastName`` property. The developer decides to add an
   ``age`` property to the ``Person`` class. 

   To migrate the realm to conform to the updated ``Person`` schema, the
   developer sets the realm's schema version in the ``RealmConfiguration`` to ``2``.
   Finally, the developer passes the configuration object to the
   ``createRealmContext()`` method.

.. _react-native-delete-a-property:

Delete a Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To delete a property from a schema, remove the property from the object's class
and set a ``schemaVersion`` of the :js-sdk:`Configuration
<Realm.html#~Configuration>` object. Deleting a property will not impact
existing objects.

.. example::

   A realm using :ref:`schema version <react-native-schema-version>` ``1`` has a
   ``Person`` object type with a ``lastName`` property. The developer decides to
   remove the property from the schema. 

   To migrate the realm to conform to the updated ``Person`` schema, the
   developer sets the realm's schema version to 2 in the ``RealmConfiguration``
   object. Finally, the developer passes the configuration object to the
   ``createRealmContext()`` method.

.. _react-native-perform-a-schema-migration:

Manually Migrate Schema
-----------------------

.. _react-native-rename-a-property:

Rename a Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To rename an object property, change the property name in the object schema and
then create a realm configuration with an incremented :ref:`schema version
<react-native-schema-version>` and a :ref:`migration <react-native-migrations>`
function that updates existing objects to use the new property name.

Migrations do not allow you to directly rename a property. Instead, you can
create a new property with the updated name, copy the value from the old
property, and then delete the old property.

.. example::
   
   A realm using :ref:`schema version <react-native-schema-version>` ``1`` has
   a ``Person`` object type. The original schema had a ``firstName`` and ``lastName``
   field. The developer later decides that the ``Person`` class should use a combined
   ``fullName`` field and removes the separate ``firstName`` and ``lastName`` fields.
   
   To migrate the realm to conform to the updated ``Person`` schema, the
   developer creates a :js-sdk:`RealmConfiguration <Realm.html#~Configuration>` object
   and sets the realm's schema version to ``2`` and defines a migration function that
   sets the value of ``fullName`` based on the existing ``firstName`` and ``lastName``
   properties. Finally, the developer passes the configuration object to the
   ``createRealmContext()`` method.

           :language: javascript
           :emphasize-lines: 6, 15, 25

.. important:: Synced Realms

   :ref:`Synced realms <sync>` only support non-breaking - also called additive
   - changes to ensure that
   older clients can sync with newer clients. Because full renames require you
   to delete the old property, you cannot rename a synchronized property without
   requiring a client reset. Instead, consider adding
   the renamed property without deleting the old property. Alternately, use 
   :ref:`mapTo <react-native-remap-a-property>` to store data using the existing 
   internal name, but let your code use a different name.  

Modify a Property Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To modify a property's type, set the property type of the field that you wish to
modify to the new data type. Then, set a ``schemaVersion``, and a ``migration``
callback function of the :js-sdk:`Configuration
<Realm.html#~Configuration>` object. 

.. note::

   :ref:`Synchronized realms <sync>` only support non-breaking changes
   to ensure that older clients can sync with newer clients. This means that
   synchronized realms do not support modifying the type of a property of a
   schema. 


.. example::
   
   A realm using :ref:`schema version <react-native-schema-version>` ``1`` has a
   ``Task`` object type. The original schema had an ``_id`` with a property type of
   ``int``. The developer later decides that the ``Task`` class's ``_id`` field should
   be of type ``ObjectId``, and updates the schema.

   To migrate the realm to conform to the updated ``Task`` schema, the developer
   creates a :js-sdk:`Configuration <Realm.html#~Configuration>` object and
   sets the realm's schema version to ``2`` and defines a migration function to
   convert the integer type to an ``Object ID`` type. Finally, the developer
   passes the configuration object to the ``createRealmContext()`` method.

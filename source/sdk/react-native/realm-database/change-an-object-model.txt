Overview
--------

When you update your object schema, you must increment the schema version 
and perform a migration. 

If your schema update adds optional properties or removes properties, 
Realm Database can perform the migration automatically. You only need to 
increment the ``schemaVersion``. 

For more complex schema updates, you must also manually specify the migration logic 
in a ``migration`` function. This might include changes such as:

- Adding required properties that must be populated with default values
- Combining fields
- Renaming a field
- Changing a field's type
- Converting from an object to an embedded object

.. tip:: Bypass Migration During Development

   When developing or debugging your application, you may prefer to delete 
   the realm instead of migrating it. Use the 
   ``deleteRealmIfMigrationNeeded`` flag to delete the database 
   automatically when a schema mismatch would require a migration. 

   Never release an app to production with this flag set to ``true``.

.. _react-native-schema-version:

Key Concept: Schema Version
---------------------------

A **schema version** identifies the state of a :ref:`realm schema
<react-native-realm-schema>` at some point in time. Realm Database tracks the
schema version of each realm and uses it to map the objects in each
realm to the correct schema.

Schema versions are ascending integers that you can optionally include
in the realm configuration when you open a realm. If a client
application does not specify a version number when it opens a realm then
the realm defaults to version ``0``.

.. important:: Increment Versions Monotonically
   
   :ref:`Migrations <react-native-migrations>` must update a realm to a
   higher schema version. Realm Database will throw an error if a client
   application opens a realm with a schema version that is lower than
   the realm's current version or if the specified schema version is the
   same as the realm's current version but includes different
   :ref:`object schemas <react-native-object-schemas>`.

.. _react-native-migrations:

Key Concept: Migrations
-----------------------

A **migration** is a function that updates a realm and any objects it
contains from one :ref:`schema version <react-native-schema-version>` to a newer
version. Migrations give you the flexibility to change your object schemas over
time to accommodate new features and refactors.

Whenever you open an existing realm with a schema version greater than the
realm's current version, Realm runs a migration function that you define.
The function has access to the realm's version number and incrementally
updates objects in the realm to conform to the new schema.

Realm automatically migrates certain changes, such as new and deleted
properties, but does not automatically set values for new properties unless the
updated object schema specifies a default value. You can define additional logic
in the migration function to further customize property values.

.. tip:: Learn How to Modify a Schema
   
   To learn how to modify your app's Realm object schemas with the React Native
   SDK, see :ref:`Modify an Object Schema <react-native-modify-an-object-schema>`.

Automatically Update Schema
---------------------------

.. _react-native-add-a-property:

Add a Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add a property to a schema, add the new property to the object's class and
set a ``schemaVersion`` of the :js-sdk:`realm's configuration object <Realm.html#~Configuration>`.

.. example::
   
   A realm using schema version ``1`` has a ``Person`` object type with a
   ``firstName``, and ``lastName`` property. The developer decides to add an
   ``age`` property to the ``Person`` class. 

   To migrate the realm to conform to the updated ``Person`` schema, the
   developer sets the realm's :ref:`schema version <react-native-schema-version>` to
   ``2``.

           :emphasize-lines: 3

.. _react-native-delete-a-property:

Delete a Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To delete a property from a schema, remove the property from the object's class
and set a ``schemaVersion`` of the :js-sdk:`realm's configuration object
<Realm.html#~Configuration>`. Deleting a property will not impact existing
objects.

.. example::
   
   A realm using schema version ``1`` has a ``Dog`` object type with a
   ``weight`` property. The developer decides to remove the property from the
   schema.

   To migrate the realm to conform to the updated ``Dog`` schema, the
   developer sets the realm's :ref:`schema version <react-native-schema-version>` to
   ``2``.

         :tabid: javascript
 
         .. literalinclude:: /examples/Migrations/LocalMigration/LocalMigration-delete-property.js

.. _react-native-perform-a-schema-migration:

Manually Migrate Schema
-----------------------

.. _react-native-rename-a-property:

Rename a Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To rename an object property, change the property name in the object schema and
then open the realm with an incremented :ref:`schema version
<react-native-schema-version>` and a :ref:`migration <react-native-migrations>` function that
updates existing objects to use the new property name.

Migrations do not allow you to directly rename a property. Instead you can
create a new property with the updated name, copy the value from the old
property, and then delete the old property.

.. example::
   
   A realm using schema version ``1`` has a ``Person`` object type. The
   original schema had a ``firstName`` and ``lastName`` field. The developer
   later decides that the ``Person`` class should use a combined ``fullName``
   field and removes the separate ``firstName`` and ``lastName`` fields.
   
   To migrate the realm to conform to the updated ``Person`` schema, the
   developer sets the realm's :ref:`schema version <react-native-schema-version>` to
   ``2`` and defines a migration function to set the value of ``fullName`` based
   on the existing ``firstName`` and ``lastName`` properties.

   .. tabs-realm-languages::
     
     .. tab::
         :tabid: javascript
 
         .. literalinclude:: /examples/Migrations/LocalMigration/LocalMigration.js
           :language: javascript
           :emphasize-lines: 3, 14

.. important:: Synced Realms

   :ref:`Synced realms <sync>` only support non-breaking - also called additive
   - changes to ensure that
   older clients can sync with newer clients. Because full renames require you
   to delete the old property, you cannot rename a synchronized property without
   requiring a client reset. Instead, consider adding
   the renamed property without deleting the old property. Alternately, use 
   :ref:`mapTo <react-native-remap-a-property>` to store data using the existing 
   internal name, but let your code use a different name.  

Modify a Property Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To modify a property's type, set the property type of the field that you wish to
modify to the new data type. Then, set a ``schemaVersion``, and a ``migration``
callback function of the :js-sdk:`realm's configuration Object
<Realm.html#~Configuration>`. 

.. note::

   :ref:`Synchronized realms <sync>` only support non-breaking changes,
   to ensure that older clients can sync with newer clients. This means that
   synchronized realms do not support modifying the type of a property of a
   schema. 


.. example::
   
   A realm using schema version ``1`` has a ``Dog`` object type. The
   original schema had an ``_id`` with a property type of ``Object ID``. The
   developer later decides that the ``Dog`` class's ``_id`` field should be of
   type ``string``, and updates the schema.

   To migrate the realm to conform to the updated ``Dog`` schema, the
   developer sets the realm's :ref:`schema version <react-native-schema-version>` to
   ``2`` and defines a migration function to convert the ``Object ID`` type to a
   ``string`` type.

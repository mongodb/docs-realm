Within a ``<RealmProvider>``, you can access a realm with
the ``useRealm()`` hook. Then, you can create Realm objects
using a :js-sdk:`Realm.write() <Realm.html#write>` transaction block.

All operations within a write transaction are :wikipedia:`atomic <Atomicity_(database_systems)>`.
If an operation in the write transaction fails, the whole transaction fails,
Realm throws an error, and no changes from the transaction block are applied to the realm.

Every write operation must occur in a write transaction.

Transaction Lifecycle
---------------------

A given realm only processes one write transaction at a time. When you 
make a write transaction, the realm adds the transaction to a queue. The 
realm evaluates each transaction in the order it arrived.

After processing a transaction, Realm Database either **commits** it or
**cancels** it:

- After a **commit**, the realm applies all operations in the transaction. 
  Once applied, the realm automatically updates :ref:`live queries
  <react-native-live-queries>`. It notifies listeners of created, modified, 
  and deleted objects.
     
  - When using :ref:`Sync <sync>`, the SDK also queues
    the changes to send to Atlas App Services. The SDK sends
    these changes when a network is available.

  - After a commit, objects and collections returned by ``useQuery`` or 
    ``useObject`` rerender to include relevant changes.

- Realm Database does not apply any operations in a **cancelled**
  transaction. Realm Database cancels a transaction if an operation 
  fails or is invalid.

You can set or change your app's log level to develop or debug your 
application. You might want to change the log level to log different
amounts of data depending on the app's environment. You can specify 
different log levels or custom loggers.

   This page shows how to set a Realm logger, which was added
   in Realm React Native SDK v12.0.0. This supersedes setting the Sync client 
   log level in earlier versions of the Realm React Native SDK. For information 
   on how to set the Sync client log level in an earlier version, refer to
   :ref:`react-native-client-log-level`.

.. _react-native-set-the-client-log-level:

Set or Change the Realm Log Level
---------------------------------

You can set the level of detail reported by the Realm React Native SDK. To
configure the log level, pass :js-sdk:`setLogLevel() <classes/Realm-1.html#setLogLevel>`
to a valid level string value:

- "all"
- "trace"
- "debug"
- "detail"
- "info"
- "warn"
- "error"
- "fatal"
- "off"

.. include:: /examples/generated/react-native/v12/Logger.snippet.set-log-level.tsx.rst

You can use ``setLogLevel()`` before you open a realm with ``RealmProvider`` or
in components nested inside ``RealmProvider``. The allows you to increase or
decrease log verbosity at different points in your code. This behavior differs
from the deprecated :ref:`sync client log level <react-native-client-log-level>`,
which had to be set before opening a synced realm and could not be changed.


You can turn off logging by passing "off" to ``setLogLevel()``:

.. include:: /examples/generated/react-native/v12/Logger.snippet.disable-logger.tsx.rst

.. _react-native-customize-logger:

Customize the Logger
--------------------

To set a custom logger, call :js-sdk:`setLogger() <classes/Realm-1.html#setLogger>`.
You must use ``setLogger()`` before you open a realm with ``RealmProvider``.
This method recieves ``level`` and ``message`` arguments from the Realm logger, 
not individual realms. You can use these arguments to define your own logging
behavior.

.. include:: /examples/generated/react-native/v12/Logger.snippet.set-custom-logger.tsx.rst

This sets the logging behavior for all Realm logging in your application. If you
do not provide a log level, the default is "info".

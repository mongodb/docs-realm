Realms are the core data structure used to organize data in Realm Database. At
its core, a realm is a collection of the objects that you use in your
application, called Realm objects, as well as additional metadata that describe
the objects.

.. tip:: Learn How to Work With a Realm
   
   See :ref:`Open & Close a Realm <react-native-open-close-realm>` for code
   examples that show how to configure and open a {+realm+} in the React Native SDK.

Realm vs Other Databases
------------------------

The {+service-short+} data model is similar to both relational and document
databases but has distinct differences from both. To underscore these
differences, it's helpful to highlight what a {+realm+} **is not**:

A {+realm+} is not a single, application-wide database.
    Applications based on other database systems generally store all of their
    data in a single database. {+app+}s often split data across multiple
    {+realms+} to organize data more efficiently and to enforce access controls.

A {+realm+} is not a relational table.
    Normalized tables in relational databases only store one type of
    information, such as street addresses or items in a store inventory. A
    {+realm+} can contain any number of object types that are relevant to a
    given domain.

A {+realm+} is not a collection of schemaless documents.
    Document databases don't necessarily enforce a strict schema for the data in
    each collection. While similar to documents in form, every Realm object
    conforms to a schema for a specific object type in the {+realm+}. An object
    cannot contain a property that is not described by its schema.

.. _react-native-object-types:
.. _react-native-object-schemas:

Object Types & Schemas
----------------------

Every Realm object conforms to a specific **object type**, which is essentially
a class that defines the properties and :ref:`relationships
<react-native-client-relationships>` for objects of that type using a pre-defined
schema. {+service-short+} guarantees that all objects in a {+realm+} conform to
the schema for their object type and validates objects whenever they're created,
modified, or deleted.

Realm objects are fundamentally similar to a common JavaScript object but they
also bring along a few additional features like schema validation and :ref:`live
queries <react-native-live-queries>`. The React Native SDK memory maps Realm objects directly
to native JavaScript objects, which means there's no need to use a special data
access library, such as an :wikipedia:`ORM <Object-relational_mapping>`.
Instead, you can work with Realm objects as you would any other object.

.. example::
   
   The following schema defines a ``Student`` object type with a string name and
   a list of integer grades.
   
   .. code-block:: javascript
      
      const studentSchema = {
        name: "Student",
        properties: {
          name: "string",
          grades: "int[]"
        }
      }

.. tip:: Learn How to Define an Object Schema
   
   For code examples that show how to define a Realm object schema in the
   React Native SDK, see :ref:`Define a Realm Object Schema
   <react-native-define-a-realm-object-schema>`.

.. _react-native-realm-schema:

Realm Schema
------------

A **{+realm+} schema** is a list of valid :ref:`object schemas
<react-native-object-schemas>` that a realm may contain. Every Realm object must conform
to an object type that's included in its realm's schema.

If a {+realm+} already contains data when you open it, {+client-database+}
validates each object to ensure that an object schema was provided for its type
and that it meets all of the constraints specified in the schema.

.. example::
   
   A {+realm+} that contains basic data about books in libraries might use a
   schema like the following:
   
   .. code-block:: json
      
      [
        {
          "type": "Library",
          "properties": {
            "address": "string",
            "books": "Book[]"
          }
        },
        {
          "type": "Book",
          "primaryKey": "isbn",
          "properties": {
            "isbn": "string",
            "title": "string",
            "author": "string",
            "numberOwned": { "type": "int?", "default": 0 },
            "numberLoaned": { "type": "int?", "default": 0 }
          }
        }
      ]

.. _react-native-realm-file:

Realm Files
-----------

Realm Database stores a binary encoded version of every object and type in a
realm in a single ``.realm`` file. The file is located at a specific path that
you define when you open the realm.

.. tip:: Implement Compacting in Your Production Application

   Every production application should implement a ``shouldCompactOnLaunch`` 
   callback to periodically reduce the realm file size.

.. note:: Auxiliary Realm Files
   
   Realm Database creates additional files for each {+realm+}.
   To learn more about these files, see :ref:`Realm Database Internals
   <react-native-realm-database>`.

.. warning:: Use Caution When Deleting Realm Files
   
   In some circumstances, such as a client reset scenario, you might need to
   delete a {+realm+} file and its auxiliary files.
   
   If you delete a {+realm+} file or any of its auxiliary files while one or
   more instances of the {+realm+} are open, you might corrupt the {+realm+} or
   disrupt :ref:`sync <sync>`.
   
   You may safely delete these files when all instances of a {+realm+} are
   closed. Before you delete a realm file, make sure that you back up any
   important objects as you will lose all unsynced data in the realm.

.. _react-native-in-memory-realm:

In-Memory Realms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also open a realm entirely in memory, which will not create a ``.realm``
file or its associated auxiliary files. Instead the SDK stores objects in memory
while the {+realm+} is open and discards them immediately when all instances are
closed.

.. _react-native-synced-realm:

Synced Realms
-------------

You can configure a realm to automatically synchronize data between many devices
that each have their own local copy of the data. Synced realms use a different
configuration than local-only realms and require a MongoDB Realm app to handle
the synchronization process.

Applications can always create, modify, and delete synced realm objects locally,
even when offline. Whenever a network connection is available, the Realm SDK
opens a connection to an application server and syncs changes to and from other
clients. The :ref:`Realm sync protocol <sync-protocol>` and server-side
operational transforms guarantee that all fully synced instances of a realm see
exactly the same data, even if some changes occurred offline and/or were
received out of order.

.. tip:: Learn How to Configure and Use Sync
   
   For more information on synced realms, including directions on how to set up
   sync in a MongoDB Realm app, see :ref:`Realm Sync Overview <sync>`.
   
   For code examples that show how to work with a synced realm in the React Native
   SDK, see :ref:`Sync Changes Between Devices
   <react-native-sync-changes-between-devices>`.

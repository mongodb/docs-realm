Overview
--------

The {+service+} React Native SDK enables development of `React
Native <https://facebook.github.io/react-native/>`__
applications using the JavaScript and `TypeScript
<https://www.typescriptlang.org/>`__ languages. React Native
enables you to build cross-platform iOS and Android apps
with a single codebase using the `React
<https://reactjs.org/>`__ framework.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before getting started, ensure your development environment
meets the following prerequisites:

- React Native v0.31.0 or later. Follow the `official React Native CLI Quickstart instructions <https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html>`__ to set up your environment.
- `CocoaPods <https://cocoapods.org/>`__ 1.10.1 or later (recommended for building an iOS app with React Native v.60+).

.. important:: Using Realm with Expo

   `Expo <https://docs.expo.dev/>`_ now supports Realm with the Expo SDK version
   44. To use Realm with Expo, upgrade to `Expo SDK version 44
   <https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/upgrading-expo-sdk-walkthrough/>`_. Realm
   does not work with earlier versions of Expo or with Expo version 45 on
   **Android**. To follow progress on its compatibility with Expo v45 on
   Android, check out the :github:` GitHub issue<realm/realm-js/issues/4639>`.
   
.. note:: Realm JS version 10.6.0 Supports Mac Catalyst
   
   For `React Native version 0.64 and below
   <https://reactnative.dev/versions>`_, building your {+service-short+} React
   Native application requires additional steps in order to :doc:`build your
   application when using Mac Catalyst
   </sdk/react-native/integrations/mac-catalyst>`.

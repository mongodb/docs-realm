Overview
--------

The {+service+} React Native SDK enables development of applications using the
JavaScript and `TypeScript <https://www.typescriptlang.org/>`__ languages.
{+service+} on React Native is best suited for writing server-side applications. Your
React Native application could be one component in a wider stack that also includes
iOS and Android apps.

The {+service+} React Native SDK is not suitable for front-end application
development.

- Due to limitations of the browser environment, it is not possible to build a
  browser-based web app with this SDK. For front-end web applications, use the
  {+service+} :doc:`GraphQL SDK </graphql>`.

- For cross-platform mobile app development using web frameworks, use the
  {+service+} :doc:`React Native SDK </react-native/install>`.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before getting started, ensure your environment meets the
following prerequisites:

- `React Native <https://react-nativejs.org/en/>`__ version 10.x or later (including React Native version 14) 
- Linux, macOS 10.8 (or later), or Windows 8 (or later)

Installation
------------

Follow these steps to create a React Native project and add the
{+service+} React Native SDK to it.

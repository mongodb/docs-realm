You can set or change your app's log level when developing or debugging 
your app. You might want to change the log level to log different 
amounts of data depending on your development needs. You can specify 
different log levels or custom loggers.

.. warning:: Java SDK Logging Support

   The Java SDK does not support the same logging API as the other SDKs.
   Instead, it uses a deprecated sync logger. Refer to the Java SDK: Deprecated
   Sync Logger section on this page for more details.

Set or Change the Log Level
---------------------------

You can set the level of detail reported by Atlas Device SDK.

Customize the Logger
--------------------

You can create a custom logger. You might want to customize logging to add
specific tags or set specific log levels during development, testing, or
debugging.

      The C++ SDK uses a sync logger that behaves differently than the rest of
      the examples on this page. You can set or change your sync client's log
      level to develop or debug your application. You might want to change the
      log level to log different amounts of data depending on the app's
      environment.

      You can set the level of detail reported by the sync client logger to 
      specify the level of output you want from the sync client. Get 
      :cpp-sdk:`an instance of an App's sync manager 
      <structrealm_1_1internal_1_1bridge_1_1sync__manager.html>`, 
      and pass a :cpp-sdk:`realm::logger::level <structrealm_1_1logger.html>`
      to the ``set_log_level()`` member function:

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/quick-start.snippet.set-sync-log-level.cpp

      The Java SDK uses an older Logger that may not behave like the other SDKs.
      The SDK logs events to the Android system log automatically. You can
      view these events using :android:`Logcat </studio/debug/am-logcat>`.

      To access newer logging features, use the Kotlin SDK.

      The Java SDK uses the log levels defined by `Log4J
      <https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/apidocs/org/apache/log4j/Level.html>`_.
      To configure the log level for database logs in your application, pass a
      :java-sdk:`LogLevel <io/realm/log/LogLevel.html>` to 
      :java-sdk:`RealmLog.setLevel() <io/realm/log/RealmLog.html#setLevel-int->`:

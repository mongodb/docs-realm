The Kotlin SDK provides methods to create and delete users in 
your Atlas App Services App.

Create a User
-------------

For most :ref:`authentication methods <authentication-providers>`, Atlas App Services 
automatically creates a :ref:`user object <user-objects>` the first time 
a user authenticates. The only exception is email/password authentication. 
When you use email/password authentication, you must :ref:`register 
<kotlin-register-email-password-user>` and :ref:`confirm 
<kotlin-confirm-a-new-users-email-address>` a user before the user can 
authenticate to an App Services App.

Remove a User
-------------

You can call the `remove <{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb/-user/remove.html>`__
method on a user to remove the ``User`` object from your client app. 
This method *does not* delete the ``User`` object from the Atlas App Services App.

The ``user.remove()`` method: 

- :ref:`Logs the user <kotlin-logout>` out if they are logged in.
- Deletes synced realms associated with the user from the device.
- Sets the
  `User.State <{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb/-user/-state/index.html>`__ 
  to ``REMOVED``. 

Because removing a user deletes any synced realms owned by the user, you 
should only call this method after closing the user's realms.

Delete a User
-------------

You can call the 
`delete <{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb/-user/delete.html>`__ 
method on a logged-in user to permanently delete the ``User`` object 
from your client app *and* the Atlas App Services App.

The ``user.delete()`` method:

- Deletes synced realms associated with the user from the device.
- Deletes the ``User`` object from the Atlas App Services server.
- Sets the
  `User.State <{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb/-user/-state/index.html>`__ 
  to ``REMOVED``.  

Because this method deletes any synced realms owned by the user, you 
should only call this method after closing the user's realms.

   :language: kotlin

To use your app in the future, the user must sign up for a new account. 
They can use the same credentials (depending on the authentication provider), 
but will not have the same user ID as their deleted account.

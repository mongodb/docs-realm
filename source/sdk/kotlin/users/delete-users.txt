The Kotlin SDK provides methods to create and delete users in your Atlas App 
Services App.

Create a User
-------------

For most :ref:`authentication methods <authentication-providers>`, Atlas App Services 
automatically creates a :ref:`user object <user-objects>` the first time 
a user authenticates. The only exception is email/password authentication. 
When you use email/password authentication, you must :ref:`register 
<kotlin-register-email-password-user>` and :ref:`confirm 
<kotlin-confirm-a-new-users-email-address>` a user before the user can 
authenticate to an App Services App.

.. tip:: Google and Apple Account Deletion Requirements

   `Google <https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/13316080?sjid=9059006274298096173-NA#account_deletion>`__ 
   and :apple:`Apple <app-store/review/guidelines/#5.1.1>` require that 
   applications listed through their respective App Stores must give any 
   user who creates an account the option to delete the account. Whether you 
   use an authentication method where you must manually register a user, 
   such as email/password authentication, or one that that automatically 
   creates a user, such as Sign-In with Apple, you must implement 
   :ref:`user account deletion <delete-user>`.

Remove a User
-------------

You can call the `remove <{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb/-user/remove.html>`__
method on a user to remove the ``User`` object from your Atlas App Services App.

This method sets the
`User.State <{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb/-user/-state/index.html>`__ 
to ``REMOVED`` and clears local data. 
If called on a logged-in user, this method logs the user out before removing them. 

This method *does not* delete the ``User`` object from the Atlas App Services server.

Delete a User
-------------

You can call the `delete <{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb/-user/delete.html>`__ 
method on a logged-in user to permanently delete the ``User`` object from your 
Atlas App Services App. 

This method deletes the ``User`` object from the server in addition to clearing
local data. You should close any realms opened by the user before deleting 
the user.

.. important:: 

   Deleting a user only deletes the user object, which may contain associated 
   :ref:`metadata <kotlin-user-metadata>`. This does not delete :ref:`custom 
   user data <kotlin-custom-user-data>` or user-entered data from your 
   application. 
   `Google <https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/13316080?sjid=9059006274298096173-NA#account_deletion>`__ 
   and :apple:`Apple <app-store/review/guidelines/#5.1.1>` require 
   that you disclose data retention and deletion policies to your 
   application customers and give them a way to request user data deletion.
   If you collect additional user data, you must implement your own methods 
   or processes to delete that data.

You can store arbitrary :ref:`custom user data <custom-user-data>` about your users 
with Atlas App Services. 
For example, you might store a user's preferred language, date of birth, or local timezone. 
Before writing and reading this data, you must enable custom user data in the backend. 

You can serialize custom user data using an EJSON encoder. For more information,
including examples, refer to :ref:`kotlin-ejson-encoding-for-atlas`.

.. important:: 

   Currently you can only read custom user data with the Kotlin SDK.
   In a future update to the SDK, you will be able to write custom user data
   from the SDK as well.

   You can create, update, or delete custom user data using one of the other
   Realm SDKs, with Atlas Functions, or by directly querying Atlas.

Before You Begin
----------------

To use custom user data, you must first enable custom user data
in App Services:

#. :ref:`Create an App <create-a-realm-app>`.
#. :ref:`Enable custom user data <enable-custom-user-data-procedure>`.

.. _kotlin-read-custom-user-data:

Read Custom User Data
---------------------

You can retrieve custom user data of a currently logged-in user using the 
`User.customDataAsBsonDocument() <{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb/-user/index.html?_ga=2.49412835.435931992.1679924388-638302271.1666007294#1591200691%2FExtensions%2F645295071>`__ 
extension function:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/AuthenticationTest.snippet.read-custom-user-data.kt
   :language: kotlin
      
Atlas App Services does *not* dynamically update the value of the client-side
user custom data document immediately when underlying data changes.
Instead, App Services fetches the most recent version of custom user
data whenever a user refreshes their :ref:`access token
<user-sessions>` or when you explicitly call the
`User.refreshCustomData() <{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb/-user/index.html#2029004456%2FFunctions%2F645295071>`__
function to request the latest version of a user's custom data.

.. _kotlin-write-custom-user-data:

Write Custom User Data with Atlas Functions
-------------------------------------------

You can write to custom user data with an Atlas Function. 
Atlas Functions are server-side JavaScript functions that are built into your backend App.
You can :ref:`call an Atlas Function <kotlin-call-function>` directly from the Realm Kotlin SDK.

Currently, it is not possible to write to custom user data directly from the Realm Kotlin SDK.

There is no single pattern for adding custom user data from an Atlas Function.
You should write your Function or Functions to suit your application's use case.

In this example, the Atlas Function takes an object passed by the client and 
adds it to the custom user data collection in Atlas. 
The Function creates the custom user data if it doesn't already exist and 
replaces all data in it if it does exist.

The Kotlin SDK code to call this Function:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/AuthenticationTest.snippet.write-custom-user-data.kt
   :language: kotlin

.. note:: 
   
    To learn more about Atlas Functions, refer to the following documentation:

    - :ref:`Call an Atlas Function <kotlin-call-function>`
    - :ref:`Atlas Functions <functions>` in the App Services documentation

.. .. _kotlin-create-custom-user-data:

.. Create a User's Custom User Data Document
.. -----------------------------------------

.. To create custom user data for a user, create a MongoDB document in the
.. custom user data collection. The user ID field of the document must
.. contain the the user's user ID. The following example uses
.. :ref:`MongoDB Data Access <>` to insert a
.. document containing the user ID of the currently logged in user and several
.. custom properties into the custom user data collection:

.. CODE_BLOCK

.. .. _kotlin-update-custom-user-data:

.. Update a User's Custom Data
.. ---------------------------

.. Updating custom user data uses the same code as writing. The following example
.. finds and updates the data by using the
.. :kotlin-sdk:`UpdateOneAsync() <>`
.. method, and then refreshes the data to ensure the latest changes are available:
.. CODE_BLOCK

.. _kotlin-delete-custom-user-data:

Delete Custom Data with Atlas Functions
---------------------------------------

Custom user data is stored in a document linked to the 
`User <{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb/-user/index.html>`__ object. 

.. important:: 

   :ref:`Deleting a user <kotlin-delete-users>` does *not* delete the custom user data. 
   You might need to fully delete user data to ensure legal compliance
   (for example, to comply with :apple:`Apple's account deletion requirements <support/offering-account-deletion-in-your-app/>`). 

To delete custom user data, you must manually delete the user's custom data document.

You can delete custom user data using an Atlas Function.
Currently, it is not possible to delete custom user data directly from the Realm Kotlin SDK.

In this example, the Atlas Function does not require any arguments.
The Function uses the function context to determine the caller's user ID, and 
deletes the custom user data document matching the user's ID.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/customUserData.snippet.delete-custom-user-data.js
   :language: js
   :caption: deleteCustomUserData.js - Atlas Function running on server (JavaScript)

The Kotlin SDK code that calls this function requires only a logged-in user to 
call the function:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/AuthenticationTest.snippet.delete-custom-user-data.kt
   :language: kotlin

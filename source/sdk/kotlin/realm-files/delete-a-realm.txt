In some circumstances, such as a client reset scenario, you might need to delete
a realm file and its auxiliary files. This is often useful during development to 
quickly reset your environment. However, doing so when you are running your app 
and realm instances are still open can cause data corruption or disrupt :ref:`sync <sync>`.

To avoid losing data, and disrupting device sync, you can delete these files when 
all instances of a realm are closed. Before you delete a realm file, however, 
**be sure that you back up any important objects as you will lose all unsynced data in the realm**.

To delete a realm file while the app is running, you can use the 
:dotnet-sdk:`DeleteRealm(configuration) <reference/Realms.Realm.html#Realms_Realm_DeleteRealm_Realms_RealmConfigurationBase_>` 
method to safely do so. The following code demonstrates this:

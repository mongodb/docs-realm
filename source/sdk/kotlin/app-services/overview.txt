Overview
--------

You can connect your client apps to the Atlas App Services
backend using the SDK. Backend functionality includes:

- :doc:`Connect to a Realm App </sdk/kotlin/app-services/connect-to-app-services-backend>`
- :doc:`Register Users </sdk/kotlin/app-services/register-users>`
- :doc:`Authenticate Users </sdk/kotlin/app-services/authenticate-users>`

The Realm App Client
--------------------

To connect to your App Services backend, start with an
`App <{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb/-app/index.html>`__ object.
This object provides all other functionality related to 
the backend. Initialize an App with the App ID, which you can 
:ref:`find in the Realm UI <find-your-app-id>`.

Authentication & User Management
--------------------------------

One of the most challenging aspects of client development is implementing a 
robust and secure authentication system. With the Realm SDKs,
however, you can use any of the Realm authentication providers with
minimal backend setup and client-side code. With the authentication APIs,
you can implement the following functionality:

- Create new user accounts
- User log in and log out
- Multiple users logged on at the same time on the same device
- Link user accounts from different providers
- Store custom data for a particular user

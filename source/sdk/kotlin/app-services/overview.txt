Overview
--------

{+service+} provides SDKs that help you connect your client apps to the {+service-short+} 
backend. The SDK provides the {+service+} functionality needed to 
authenticate users with any of the built-in :ref:`Authentication providers <authentication-providers>`, 
call backend :ref:`functions <functions>`, and directly access a 
:ref:`MongoDB database <mongodb-service>`. 

The Realm App Client
--------------------

When using the SDK to access the {+service-short+} backend, you start with a 
Realm App object. This object provides all other functionality related to 
MongoDB Realm. :ref:`Initialize <kotlin-connect-to-mongodb-realm-backend-app>`
the ``App`` object is with :ref:`your Realm app ID <find-your-app-id>`.

.. tip::

   To learn how to initialize the Realm App client, see
   :ref:`kotlin-init-appclient`.

Authentication & User Management
--------------------------------

One of the most challenging aspects of client development is implementing a 
robust and secure authentication system. With the {+service-short+} SDKs, however, you 
can use any of the {+service+} authentication providers with very minimal backend 
setup or client-side code required. With the authentication APIs, you can 
implement the following functionality:

- Creation of new user accounts
- User log-in and log-out
- Multiple users logged on at the same time on the same device 
- Linking user accounts from different providers 
- Providing custom user data 

.. tip::

   To learn how to set up authentication with different providers, see
   :ref:`kotlin-authenticate`.

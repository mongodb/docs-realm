Overview
--------

You can connect your client apps to the App Services
backend using the SDK. Backend functionality includes:

- :doc:`Connect to a Realm App </sdk/kotlin/app-services/connect-to-app-services-backend>`
- :doc:`Register Users </sdk/kotlin/app-services/register-users>`
- :doc:`Authenticate Users </sdk/kotlin/app-services/authenticate-users>`

The Realm App Client
--------------------

To connect to your {+service-short+} backend, start with an
:kotlin-sdk:`App <{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb/-app/index.html>` object.
This object provides all other functionality related to 
the backend. Initialize an App with the {+app+} ID, which you can 
:ref:`find in the Realm UI <find-your-app-id>`.

   To learn how to initialize the Realm App client, see
   :ref:`kotlin-connect-to-backend`.

Authentication & User Management
--------------------------------

One of the most challenging aspects of client development is implementing a 
robust and secure authentication system. With the {+service-short+} SDKs,
however, you can use any of the {+service+} authentication providers with
minimal backend setup and client-side code. With the authentication APIs,
you can implement the following functionality:

- Create new user accounts
- User log in and log out
- Multiple users logged on at the same time on the same device
- Link user accounts from different providers
- Store custom data for a particular user

   :ref:`kotlin-authenticate`.

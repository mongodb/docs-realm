Realm provides :ref:`many authentication providers <authentication-providers>` 
to log users into your app. Each provider creates a unique user identity. 
Realm lets you merge multiple credentials into one user identity.

Example
-------

Consider an application that offers :ref:`anonymous login
<anonymous-authentication>`, which allows users to explore the app without 
registering. If a user wants to continue using the application, they can create 
a permanent account by using another Authentication provider. Realm 
creates a new ``User`` object. The app can then link the new identity with the 
current User.

.. note:: 

   Depending on how you have configured email/password authentication, there may 
   be additional steps (confirming the email address, for example) before the 
   new account is created and can be linked.

You link credentials using 
`linkCredentials <{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb/-user/link-credentials.html>`__
This links authentication providers to a logged-in 
`User <{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb/-user/index.html>`__.

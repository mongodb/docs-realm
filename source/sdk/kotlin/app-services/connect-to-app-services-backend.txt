The ``App`` class is the interface to App Services. This class provides
access to :ref:`authentication <kotlin-authenticate>` and {+sync+}.

.. _kotlin-access-the-app-client:

Access the App
--------------

Pass the App ID for your {+app+}, which you can :ref:`find in the Realm UI
<find-your-app-id>`.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/AppClientTest.snippet.initialize-app-client.kt
   :language: kotlin
   :copyable: false

.. note::

   You can create multiple :file:`App` instances to connect to multiple
   {+app+}s or to the same {+app+} with different configurations. All
   :file:`App` instances that share the same App ID use the same underlying
   connection.

.. _kotlin-app-client-configuration:

Configuration
-------------

For more granular control of the details of your app connection,
such as custom timeouts for connections and keys for local encryption,
use the `AppConfiguration.Builder
<{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb/-app-configuration/-builder/index.html>`__ to control details of your ``App``:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/AppClientTest.snippet.configure-app-client.kt
   :language: kotlin
   :copyable: false

.. note:: 

   For most use cases, you only need your application's App ID to connect
   to {+service+}. The other settings demonstrated here are optional.

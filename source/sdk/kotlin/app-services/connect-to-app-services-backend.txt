The ``App`` class is the interface to App Services. This class provides
access to :ref:`authentication <kotlin-authenticate>` and Device Sync.

.. _kotlin-access-the-app-client:

Access the App
--------------

Pass the App ID for your App, which you can :ref:`find in the App Services UI
<find-your-app-id>`.

Configuration
-------------

For most use cases, you only need your application's App ID to connect
to App Services. For more granular control of the details of your app connection,
such as custom timeouts for connections and keys for local encryption,
use the `AppConfiguration.Builder
<{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb/-app-configuration/-builder/index.html>`__ to control details of your ``App``:

This page describes how to initialize your App client and connect to the Atlas 
App Services backend using the Kotlin SDK.

The App client is the interface to the App Services backend. It provides 
access to App Services functionality, including:

- :ref:`Authenticating <kotlin-authenticate>` app users
- :ref:`Synchronizing data <kotlin-sync>` between the Atlas backend and the 
  client app using Device Sync
- :ref:`Calling Atlas functions <kotlin-call-function>`

Each App client is associated with a single App ID. 

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you can connect to Atlas App Services, you need an App Services App 
with an App ID. To get started, refer to :ref:`Create an App <create-a-realm-app>` 
in the App Services documentation.

To learn how to find your App ID in the App Services UI, refer to 
:ref:`Find Your App ID <find-your-app-id>` in the App Services documentation.

.. _kotlin-access-the-app-client:

Access the App Client
---------------------

The Kotlin SDK uses the 
`App <{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb/-app/index.html>`__
interface to access an ``App`` client. 

You can initialize an App with default configuration values using 
`App.create() 
<{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb/-app-configuration/-companion/create.html>`__. 
You only need to pass the App ID for your App. 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/AppClientTest.snippet.initialize-app-client.kt
   :language: kotlin

Once you have initialized the App, you can use the ``App`` instance to
access App Services functionality.

.. _kotlin-app-client-configuration:

Configure the App Client
------------------------

You can add optional arguments to the ``AppConfiguration`` for more
granular control of your app connection details, such as custom 
request headers and keys for local encryption. 

To control the additional configuration options, use the 
`AppConfiguration.Builder
<{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb/-app-configuration/-builder/index.html>`__ 
and call the ``.build()`` method to pass a configuration object:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/AppClientTest.snippet.configure-app-client.kt
   :language: kotlin

.. include:: /includes/multiple-app-client-details-and-app-config-cache.rst

.. _kotlin-encrypt-app-metadata:

Encrypt App Metadata 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you connect to App Services, Realm creates additional metadata files on 
a device. For more information about these metadata files, refer to 
:ref:`<kotlin-realm-database-internals>`.

You can encrypt the metadata that App Services stores on client devices,
similar to how you :ref:`<kotlin-encrypt-a-synced-realm>`. 

To encrypt App metadata, pass your encryption key to the 
`encryptionKey <{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb/-app-configuration/encryption-key.html>`__
property when you initialize the App: 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/AppClientTest.snippet.encrypted-app-client.kt
   :language: kotlin

.. note:: Metadata Encrypted By Default on Apple Devices

   On Apple devices, metadata is encrypted by default. To disable this, 
   add ``REALM_DISABLE_METADATA_ENCRYPTION`` to your environment variables.

Set Custom HTTP Headers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 1.11.0

If you use App Services or Device Sync with a proxy setup, you may need to set 
custom HTTP headers. The Realm Kotlin SDK supports setting custom HTTP headers 
on the App. These headers are appended to every request to the App Services 
App, including :ref:`function calls <kotlin-call-function>`.

When you initialize the App, you can pass:  

- the custom `authorizationHeaderName 
  <{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb/-app-configuration/authorization-header-name.html>`__
  ``String`` value
- any `customRequestHeaders 
  <{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb/-app-configuration/custom-request-headers.html>`__ 
  in a map of ``String`` header keys and values (SDK accepts empty values but 
  not empty keys)

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/AppClientTest.snippet.set-custom-http-headers.kt
   :language: kotlin

Close the App Client
--------------------

You can manually close an App instance and release all underlying resources 
using the `App.close() 
<{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb/-app/close.html>`__ method:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/AppClientTest.snippet.close-app-client.kt
   :language: kotlin

If not closed manually, resources are freed when the App instance is garbage collected.

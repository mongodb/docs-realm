App errors fall into two major categories: `ServiceException <{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb.exceptions/-service-exception/index.html>`__
and
`SyncException <{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb.exceptions/-sync-exception/index.html>`__.

Service Errors
--------------

Service errors occur when an App Services request fails at the HTTP level, i.e. the HTTP request returned, but the HTTP Status code was not 200 (OK).


Connection Errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Connection errors happen when HTTP communication fails between the SDK
and the App Services backend, ie. the HTTP request isn't able to receive a status code.

Because these errors stem from network layers outside of the SDK's
control, you should consider these errors ephemeral. Retry the operation,
then investigate the error if the retry fails. If the operation fails
because the client device isn't connected to the internet, you can ask
the app user to retry the operation when they reconnect to the internet.

Bad Request Errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bad request errors come from malformed App Services requests.

When you get a bad request error:

- Check the inputs for the operation.
- Check your App logs for more information about what went wrong.

.. _kotlin-auth-errors:

Auth Errors
~~~~~~~~~~~

Auth errors happen when a user account action, such as login, logout,
or registration, fails. Usually you'll get a more specific subtype that
helps you identify a solution.

User Already Confirmed Errors
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

User already confirmed errors occur when you attempt to
`confirm <{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb.auth/-email-password-auth/confirm-user.html>`__
a user who has already been confirmed.

When you get a user already confirmed error, it's best to not disrupt
the application flow. Since the user is confirmed, you can safely proceed
to log in. There is no need to retry confirmation.

User Not Found Errors
+++++++++++++++++++++

User not found errors occur when the App Services backend cannot find a
user with the supplied username. This is commonly caused by typos in
email/password usernames.

When you experience this error, prompt the user to re-enter their
username and try again.

User Already Exists Errors
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

User already exists errors occur when a client attempts to register a
user with a username that is already in use in that App.

When you experience this error, prompt users to:

- use a different username
- login with their existing username if they already have an account

Invalid Credential Errors
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Invalid credential errors occur when a JWT, email/password, or API Key
user login fails due to invalid credentials. Other authentication
providers throw an :ref:`Auth Error <kotlin-auth-errors>` instead.

Sync Errors
-----------

Sync errors occur when Device Sync fails.

Unrecoverable Sync Errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unrecoverable sync errors happen when Device Sync fails catastrophically.
This usually means a bug in the client or connected App.

When an unrecoverable sync error occurs, you should surface the problem
to the end user. Let them know that Device Sync won't work until the
problem is solved. It's best to send yourself an alert so you can check
the backend App logs and fix the problem as soon as possible.

Wrong Sync Type Errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wrong sync type errors happen when the client and App use different sync
protocols. The SDK supports two kinds of sync: **flexible sync** and
**partition based** sync. When a client connects to an App using a sync
type that does not match the App's sync type, a wrong sync type error occurs.

To recover from a wrong sync type error, update the client to use a sync
type that matches the backend. This will most likely require the user
to update to a new version of your app containing the fix.

Bad Flexible Sync Query Errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bad flexible sync query errors happen when you try to subscribe to a
flexible sync query that is not supported by the App backend. This can
happen when you:

- query a field not specified as a **queryable field** in your flexible
  sync configuration
- create a flexible sync query using operators unsupported by flexible
  sync

To recover from a bad flexible sync query error, update your client to
use a sync query compatible with your App configuration. This will most
likely require the user to update to a new version of your app containing
the fix.

:term:`{+client-database+}` uses a highly efficient storage engine
to persist objects. You can **create** objects in a :term:`{+realm+}`,
**update** objects in a {+realm+}, and eventually **delete**
objects from a {+realm+}. Because these operations modify the
state of the {+realm+}, we call them writes.

{+service-short+} handles writes in terms of **transactions**. A
transaction is a list of read and write operations that
{+service-short+} treats as a single indivisible operation. In other
words, a transaction is *all or nothing*: either all of the
operations in the transaction succeed or none of the
operations in the transaction take effect.

.. note::

   All writes must happen in a transaction.

A {+realm+} allows only one open write transaction at a time. {+service-short+}
blocks other writes on other threads until the open
transaction is complete. Consequently, there is no race
condition when reading values from the {+realm+} within a
transaction.

When you are done with your transaction, {+service-short+} either
**commits** it or **cancels** it:

- When {+service-short+} **commits** a transaction, {+service-short+} writes
  all changes to disk. For synced realms, the SDK queues the change
  for synchronization with the backend.
- When {+service-short+} **cancels** a write transaction or an operation in
  the transaction causes an error, all changes are discarded
  (or "rolled back").

.. _kotlin-open-a-transaction:

Run a Transaction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+service-short+} represents each transaction as a callback function
that contains zero or more read and write operations. To run
a transaction, define a transaction callback and pass it to
the {+realm+}'s ``write`` method. Within this callback, you are
free to create, read, update, and delete on the {+realm+}. If
the code in the callback throws an exception when {+service-short+} runs
it, {+service-short+} cancels the transaction. Otherwise, {+service-short+} commits
the transaction immediately after the callback.

.. example::

   The following code shows how to run a transaction with
   :kotlin-sdk:`write() <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm/-realm/write.html>`
   or :kotlin-sdk:`writeBlocking() <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm/-realm/write-blocking.html>`.
   If the code in the callback throws an exception, {+service-short+}
   cancels the transaction. Otherwise, {+service-short+} commits the
   transaction.

Serialization - Kotlin SDK
==========================

Serialization methods used by libraries that depend on reflection, such as
`GSON <https://github.com/google/gson>`__ do not work with the SDK
by default.

This is because the SDK compiler plugin injects a hidden field
into object models, prefixed with ``io_realm_kotlin_``. The SDK uses
this hidden field to manage internal object state. Any library that
relies on fields instead of getters and setters needs to ignore this
hidden field.

To use the SDK with external libraries such as GSON, exclude the hidden
fields from serialization using a prefix match:

.. code-block:: kotlin
   :copyable: false

   var gson: Gson = GsonBuilder()
       .setExclusionStrategies(object: ExclusionStrategy {
           override fun shouldSkipField(f: FieldAttributes?): Boolean =
               f?.name?.startsWith("io_realm_kotlin_") ?: false
           override fun shouldSkipClass(clazz: Class<*>?): Boolean =
               false
       })
       .create()

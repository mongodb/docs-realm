You cannot store Kotlin's built-in ``Date`` or ``Instant`` types in Realm
Database. Instead, use the
`RealmInstant <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.types/-realm-instant/index.html>`__
type, which stores time information as a UNIX epoch timestamp.

If you need timestamp data in a form other than ``RealmInstant``, you
can add conversion code to your model class based on the following
example:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SchemaTest.snippet.timestamp-workaround.kt
   :language: kotlin
   :copyable: false

Realm Database supports the following field data types:

- :file:`Boolean` or :file:`boolean`
- :file:`Integer` or :file:`int`
- :file:`Short` or :file:`short`
- :file:`Long` or :file:`long`
- :file:`Byte` or :file:`byte[]`
- :file:`Double` or :file:`double`
- :file:`Float` or :file:`float`
- :file:`String`
- :file:`Date`
- :file:`Decimal128` from :file:`org.bson.types`
- :file:`ObjectId` from :file:`org.bson.types`
- Any :file:`RealmObject` subclass
- :file:`RealmList`

The :file:`Byte`, :file:`Short`, :file:`Integer`, and :file:`Long` types and their
lowercase primitive alternatives are all stored as :file:`Long` values
within Realm Database. Similarly, Realm Database stores objects
of the :file:`Float` and :file:`float` types as type :file:`Double`.

Realm Database does not support fields with modifiers :file:`final` and
:file:`volatile`, though you can use fields with those modifiers if you
:kotlin-sdk:`ignore <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.annotations/-ignore/index.html>`
them. If you choose to provide custom constructors, you must declare a
public constructor with no arguments.

Updating Strings and Byte Arrays
--------------------------------

Since {+client-database+} operates on fields as a whole, it's not possible
to directly update individual elements of strings or byte arrays. Instead,
you'll need to read the whole field, make your modification to individual
elements, and then write the entire field back again in a transaction block.

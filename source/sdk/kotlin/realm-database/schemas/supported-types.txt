Realm Database supports the following field data types:

- ``String``
- ``Byte``
- ``Char``
- ``Short``
- ``Int``
- ``Long``
- ``Boolean``
- ``Double``
- ``Float``
- ``ObjectId``
- ``RealmInstant``
- Any ``RealmObject`` subclass
- ``RealmList``
- ``RealmUUID``

Realm Database stores all non-decimal numeric types as ``Long`` values.
Similarly, Realm Database stores all decimal numeric types as ``Double``
values.

Realm Database does not support fields with modifiers ``final`` and
``volatile``, though you can use fields with those modifiers if you
:ref:`ignore <kotlin-ignore>` them. If you choose to provide custom
constructors, you must declare a public constructor with no arguments.

Updating Strings and Byte Arrays
--------------------------------

Since Realm Database operates on fields as a whole, it's not possible
to directly update individual elements of strings or byte arrays. Instead,
you'll need to read the whole field, make your modification to individual
elements, and then write the entire field back again in a transaction block.

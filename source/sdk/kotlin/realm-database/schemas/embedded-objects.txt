Overview
--------

An embedded object is a special type of :ref:`Realm object
<kotlin-object-type>` that models complex data about a specific object.
Embedded objects are similar to :ref:`relationships
<kotlin-relationships>`, but they provide additional constraints.

Realm treats each embedded object as nested data inside of a single specific
parent object.
An embedded object inherits the lifecycle of its parent object.
It cannot exist as an independent Realm object. 

Embedded objects have the following properties: 

- Embedded objects are deleted when their parent object is deleted 
  or their parent no longer references them. 
- Embedded objects cannot have a :ref:`primary key <kotlin-primary-keys>`. 
- You cannot reassign an embedded object to a different parent object.
- You cannot link to an embedded object from multiple parent objects. 
- You can only query an embedded object by accessing it through its parent object.

.. tip:: Embedded Object Types are Reusable and Composable

   You can use the same embedded object type in multiple parent object types, and
   you can embed objects inside other embedded objects. You can even
   recursively reference an embedded object type as an optional property in its
   own definition.

Define an Embedded Object
-------------------------

To define an embedded object, derive a class from `EmbeddedRealmObject <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}/io.realm.kotlin.types/-embedded-realm-object/index.html>`__: 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/DataTypesTest.snippet.embedded-object-model.kt 
    :language: kotlin


Read and Write Embedded Objects
-------------------------------

Once your embedded object class is defined, you must include its schema in the
realm's 
`configuration <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin/-realm-configuration/index.html>`__:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/DataTypesTest.snippet.open-realm-embedded-object.kt 
    :language: kotlin 
    :emphasize-lines: 3

Create an Embedded Object
-------------------------

To create an embedded object, assign an instance of the embedded object
to a parent object's property:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/DataTypesTest.snippet.create-embedded-object.kt 
    :language: kotlin


Update an Embedded Object Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To update a property in an embedded object, modify the property in a
write transaction:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/DataTypesTest.snippet.update-embedded-object.kt 
    :language: kotlin


Overwrite an Embedded Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To overwrite an embedded object, reassign the embedded object properties to a new 
instance in a write transaction:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/DataTypesTest.snippet.overwrite-embedded-object.kt 
    :language: kotlin


Query a Collection on Embedded Object Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use dot notation to filter or sort a collection of objects based on an embedded 
object property value:

.. include:: /includes/directly-query-embedded-objects-note.rst

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/DataTypesTest.snippet.query-embedded-objects.kt 
    :language: kotlin

.. tip:: 

    You can use the `parent <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.ext/parent.html>`__ property to access the parent of the embedded object.

Delete an Embedded Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning:: Realm Uses Cascading Deletes for Embedded Objects

   When you delete a Realm object, Realm automatically deletes any
   embedded objects referenced by that object. 
   If you want the referenced objects to persist after the deletion of the 
   parent object, use a regular Realm object with a :ref:`to-one relationship 
   <kotlin-to-one-relationship>` instead.

To delete an embedded object, you can either: 

- Delete the embedded object from the parent. 
- Delete the parent, which also deletes the embedded object.  

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/DataTypesTest.snippet.delete-embedded-object.kt 
    :language: kotlin

To define a primary key for an object type, use the `@PrimaryKey
<{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.types.annotations/-primary-key/index.html>`__
annotation:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SchemaTest.snippet.primary-key.kt
   :language: kotlin

Realm Database treats fields marked with the ``@PrimaryKey`` annotation
as primary keys for their corresponding  :ref:`object schema <kotlin-object-schema>`. 
The primary key is a unique identifier for an object in a realm.
No other objects of the same type may share an object's primary key.

Important aspects of primary keys:

- You can define only one primary key per object schema.
- You cannot change the primary key field for an object type after
  adding any object of that type to a realm.
- Primary key values must be unique across all instances of an object
  in a realm. Attempting to insert a duplicate primary key value results
  in an error.
- Primary key values are immutable. To change the primary key value of
  an object, you must delete the original object and insert a new object
  with a different primary key value.
- Primary keys are nullable. ``null`` can only be the primary key of one object
  in a collection.
  Realm automatically indexes primary keys, so you can efficiently read and modify objects based on their primary key.

You can create a primary key with any of the following types:

- ``String``
- ``Byte``
- ``Char``
- ``Short``
- ``Int``
- ``Long``
- ``ObjectId``
- ``RealmUUID``

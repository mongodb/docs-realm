By default, Realm Database uses the name defined in the model class
to represent fields internally. 
In some cases, you might want to change this behavior:

- To make it easier to work across platforms where naming conventions differ. 
  For example, if your Device Sync schema property names use snake case, 
  while your project uses camel case.
- To change a field name in Kotlin without forcing a :ref:`migration <kotlin-migrations>`.

To map a different property name in your code than is stored in
Realm Database, use the `@PersistedName <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.types.annotations/-persisted-name/index.html>`__
annotation in the :ref:`object schema <kotlin-object-schema>`:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SchemaTest.snippet.persisted-name.kt
   :language: kotlin

Note that migrations must use the internal name when creating classes and 
properties, and any schema errors reported will use the internal name. 

You can query by both the internal name and the remapped name.

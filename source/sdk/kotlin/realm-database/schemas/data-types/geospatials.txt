.. versionadded:: 1.11.0

Geospatial data, or "geodata", specifies points and geometric objects on the Earth's 
surface. 

Kotlin SDK version 1.11.0 and later adds support for experimental geospatial APIs 
that support querying with geosptial data. These queries can check whether a given  
point is contained within a shape. For example, you can find all coffee shops within 
15 km of a specified point.

Geospatial Data Types
---------------------

The Kotlin SDK supports geospatial queries using the following data types:

- GeoPoint
- GeoCircle
- GeoBox
- GeoPolygon

.. note::

   Currently, geospatial data types cannot be persisted. For example, you can't 
   declare a property that is of type ``GeoBox``. 
   
   These types can only be used as arguments for geospatial queries.

.. _kotlin-geopoint:

GeoPoint
~~~~~~~~

A `GeoPoint <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}reference/Realms.GeoPoint.html>`__ defines a specific 
location on the Earth's surface. All of the geospatial data types use ``GeoPoints`` 
to define their location. 

.. _kotlin-geocircle:

GeoCircle
~~~~~~~~~
A `GeoCircle <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}reference/Realms.GeoCircle.html>`__ defines a circle on 
the Earth's surface. You define a ``GeoCircle`` by providing a ``GeoPoint`` 
for the center of the circle and a `Distance <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}reference/Realms.Distance.html>`__ 
object to specify the radius of the circle. 

.. note::
   
   You can define the radius in kilometers, miles, degrees, or radians.

The following example creates 2 circles:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/Geospatial.snippet.geocircle.kt
   :language: kotlin

.. _kotlin-geobox:

GeoBox
~~~~~~

A `GeoBox <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}reference/Realms.GeoBox.html>`__ defines a rectangle on  
the Earth's surface. You define the rectangle by specifying the bottom left 
(southwest) corner and the top right (northeast) corner. 

The following example creates 2 boxes:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/Geospatial.snippet.geobox.kt
   :language: kotlin

.. figure:: /images/geoboxes.png
   :alt: 2 GeoBoxes
   :width: 150

.. _kotlin-geopolygon:

GeoPolygon
~~~~~~~~~~

A `GeoPolygon <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}reference/Realms.GeoPolygon.html>`__ defines a polygon 
on the Earth's surface. 

Because a polygon is a closed shape, you must provide a minimum of 4 points: 
3 points to define the polygon's shape and a fourth to close the shape.

.. important::

   The fourth point in a polygon *must* be the same as the first point.

You can also exclude areas within a polygon by defining one or more "holes". 
A hole is another polygon whose bounds fit completely within the outer polygon. 
Holes can also be nested within each other. A location is considered inside the 
polygon if it is included in an odd number of rings.

The following example creates 3 polygons: 

- A basic polygon with 5 points 
- The same polygon with a single hole
- The same polygon with two holes

Persisting GeoPoint Data
------------------------ 

If you want to persist ``GeoPoint`` data, it must conform to the 
`GeoJSON spec <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946>`__. 

Creating a GeoJSON-Compatible Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a class that conforms to the GeoJSON spec, you:

1. Create an :ref:`embedded realm object <kotlin-embedded-objects>` 
   (a class that inherits from 
   `EmbeddedRealmObject <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.types/-embedded-realm-object/index.html>`__).

#. At a minimum, add the two fields required by the GeoJSON spec:

   - A field of type ``String`` property that maps to a ``type`` property 
     with the value of ``"Point"``: ``var type: String = "Point"``

   - A field of type ``RealmList<Double>`` that maps to a ``coordinates`` 
     property in the realm schema containing a latitude/longitude 
     pair: ``var coordinates: RealmList<Double> = realmListOf()``

The following example shows an embedded class named ``CustomGeoPoint`` that is used 
to persist GeoPoint data:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/Geospatial.snippet.custom-geopoint.kt
   :language: kotlin

Using the Embedded Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the ``customGeoPoint`` class in your realm model, as shown in the 
following example:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/Geospatial.snippet.geopoint-model.kt
   :language: kotlin
   :emphasize-lines: 4

You can then add instances of your class to the realm:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/Geospatial.snippet.create-geopoint.kt
   :language: kotlin

The following image shows the results of creating these two ``Company`` objects:

Querying Geospatial Data
------------------------

To query against geospatial data, you can use the ``GEOWITHIN`` operator with 
:ref:`RQL <realm-query-language>`. This method takes the ``coordinates`` 
property of an embedded object and checks if that point is contained within 
the geospatial shape for that object. 

The format for querying geospatial data is the same, regardless of the shape of 
the geodata region.

.. important::
   
   You cannot use parameterized queries with geospatial data.

Examples

The following examples show querying against various shapes to return a list of 
companies within the shape:

A relationship is an object property that references another Realm object.

Relationships are direct references to other objects in a realm, which
means that you don't need bridge tables or explicit joins to define a
relationship like you would in a relational database. Instead, you can
access related objects by reading and writing to the property that
defines the relationship. Realm Database executes read operations
lazily, so querying objects with relationship fields doesn't slow
queries.

There are two primary types of relationships between objects:

- To-One Relationship
- To-Many Relationship

.. note:: One-to vs. Many-to Relationships

   In Realm Database, there is no way to limit object references from
   other objects within the same realm. As a result, there is no way to
   restrict a relationship to "one to one/one to many" instead of "many to
   one/many to many".

You can define relationships in your object schema using the following
types:

- ``RealmObject``
- ``RealmList <? extends RealmObject>``

To-One Relationship
-------------------

A to-one relationship means that an object is related 
to no more than one other object. Setting a relationship field to ``null``
removes the connection between objects, but Realm Database does not
delete the referenced object.

To set up a many-to-one or one-to-one relationship, create a field
whose type is a Realm object in your application:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SchemaTest.codeblock.to-one-relationship.kt
   :language: kotlin
   :copyable: false

Each ``Sushi`` references either zero ``Fish`` instances or one other
``Fish`` instance. Nothing prevents multiple Frog instances from
referencing the same Frog as a best friend; the distinction between a
many-to-one and a one-to-one relationship is up to your application.

To-Many Relationship
--------------------

A to-many relationship means that an object is related in a specific way
to multiple objects. You can create a relationship between one object
and any number of objects using a field of type ``RealmList<?>`` where
``T`` is a Realm object in your application:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SchemaTest.codeblock.to-many-relationship.kt
   :language: kotlin
   :copyable: false

RealmLists are containers of RealmObjects, but otherwise behave like a
regular collection. The same object can occur in multiple to-many
relationships; the distinction between a many-to-many and a one-to-many
relationship is up to your application.

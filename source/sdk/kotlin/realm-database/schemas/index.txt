Indexes speed up some queries, but slow down inserts and updates.
Realm Database stores indexes on disk, which makes your
realm files larger. To index a field, use the
:kotlin-sdk:`@Index <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.annotations/-index/index.html>`
annotation:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SchemaTest.snippet.index.kt
   :language: kotlin
   :copyable: false

Indexes support the efficient execution of queries in Realm Database.
Without indexes, Realm Database must perform a collection scan, i.e.,
scan every document in a collection, to select those documents that
match a query. If an appropriate index exists for a query, Realm
Database can use the index to limit the number of documents that it
must inspect.

Indexes are special data structures that store a small portion of a
realm's data in an easy to traverse form. The index stores the value
of a specific field ordered by the value of the field. The ordering of
the index entries supports efficient equality matches and range-based
query operations.

You can index fields with the following types:

- ``String``
- ``Byte``
- ``Short``
- ``Int``
- ``Long``
- ``Boolean``
- ``RealmInstant``

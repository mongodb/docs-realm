To prevent a field from persisting in Realm Database or being included
in the ``RealmObject`` :ref:`object schema <kotlin-object-schema>`, use the 
`@Ignore <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.types.annotations/-ignore/index.html>`__
annotation:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SchemaTest.snippet.ignore.kt
   :language: kotlin

Ignored properties behave exactly like normal properties, but they are 
not stored to the database.  
They can't be used in queries and don't trigger Realm notifications.

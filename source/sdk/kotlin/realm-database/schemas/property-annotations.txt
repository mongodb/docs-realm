You can use annotations to add functionality to properties in your Realm 
:ref:`object models <kotlin-object-schema>`.

.. _kotlin-optional:

Required and Optional Properties
--------------------------------

In Kotlin, value types are implicitly non-nullable. 
You can make properties optional (nullable) using the built-in ``?`` Kotlin operator.

Default Field Values
--------------------

You can assign a default value to a property in the property declaration.

.. _kotlin-primary-keys:

Specify a Primary Key
---------------------

You can specify a property as the object type's primary key using the 
`@PrimaryKey <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.types.annotations/-primary-key/index.html>`__
annotation:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SchemaTest.snippet.declare-properties.kt
  :language: kotlin
  :emphasize-lines: 2-3

Realm Database treats fields marked with the ``@PrimaryKey`` annotation
as primary keys for their corresponding :ref:`object schema <kotlin-object-schema>`. 
The primary key is a unique identifier for an object in a realm.
No other objects of the same type may share an object's primary key.

Important aspects of primary keys:

- You can define only one primary key per object schema.
- You cannot change the primary key field for an object type after
  adding any object of that type to a realm.
- Primary key values must be unique across all instances of an object
  in a realm. Attempting to insert a duplicate primary key value results
  in an error.
- Primary key values are immutable. To change the primary key value of
  an object, you must delete the original object and insert a new object
  with a different primary key value.
- Primary keys are nullable. ``null`` can only be the primary key of one object
  in a collection.
- Realm automatically indexes primary keys, so you can efficiently 
  read and modify objects based on their primary key.

You can create a primary key with any of the following types:

- ``String``
- ``Byte``
- ``Char``
- ``Short``
- ``Int``
- ``Long``
- ``ObjectId``
- ``RealmUUID``
 
.. _kotlin-remap-a-property:

Map a Property or Class to a Different Name
-------------------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 10.8.0 Remap class names with @PersistedName

By default, Realm Database uses the name defined in the model class
to represent classes and fields internally. 
In some cases, you might want to change this behavior:

- To make it easier to work across platforms where naming conventions differ. 
  For example, if your Device Sync schema property names use snake case, 
  while your project uses camel case.
- To change a class or field name in Kotlin without forcing a :ref:`migration <kotlin-migrations>`.
- To support multiple model classes with the same simple name in different packages.
- To use a class name that is longer than the 57-character limit enforced by Realm Database.

To map a class or property name in your code to a different name to store in
Realm Database, use the `@PersistedName <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.types.annotations/-persisted-name/index.html>`__
annotation in the :ref:`object schema <kotlin-object-schema>`. Specify 
a class or property ``name`` that you want persisted to the realm. 
If you write to a synced realm, the Sync schema sees the values stored using the
persisted class or property name.

Note that migrations must use the persisted class or property name, 
and any schema errors reported also use the persisted name. 

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Remap a Class
      :tabid: class-persisted-name

      In this example, ``Cat`` is the Kotlin class name used in the code 
      throughout the project to perform CRUD operations, and ``Feline`` is the
      persisted name to used to store objects in Realm Database:

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SchemaTest.snippet.class-persisted-name.kt
        :language: kotlin

      .. important::
        
          Queries on class names remapped in this way must use the persisted name,
          not the Kotlin name, when querying an inverse relationship.

   .. tab:: Remap a Property
      :tabid: property-persisted-name

      In this example, ``species`` is the Kotlin property name used in the code 
      throughout the project to perform CRUD operations and ``latin_name`` is the 
      persisted name used to store values in Realm Database:

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SchemaTest.snippet.declare-properties.kt
        :language: kotlin
        :emphasize-lines: 15-16

      You can query by both the Kotlin name used in the code
      and by the persisted name stored in Realm Database.

.. _kotlin-ignore:

Ignore Properties from Realm Schema
-----------------------------------

By default, Realm manages properties defined in your Realm object model. 

- Managed properties are stored or updated in the database.
- Ignored properties are *not* stored to the database. They behave exactly like 
  normal properties, but they can't be used in queries and don't trigger Realm 
  notifications.
 
You can mix managed and ignored properties within a class. 

To ignore a property and prevent it from persisting in Realm Database or being included
in the ``RealmObject`` :ref:`object schema <kotlin-object-schema>`, use the 
`@Ignore <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.types.annotations/-ignore/index.html>`__
annotation:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SchemaTest.snippet.declare-properties.kt
  :language: kotlin
  :emphasize-lines: 12-13

.. _kotlin-indices:

Index Properties
----------------

Indexes speed up some queries at the cost of slightly slower write times and
additional storage and memory overhead. Realm Database stores indexes on disk,
which makes your realm files larger. Each index entry is
a minimum of 12 bytes.

To create an index on a property, use the `@Index
<{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.types.annotations/-index/index.html>`__
annotation in the :ref:`object schema <kotlin-object-schema>`:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SchemaTest.snippet.declare-properties.kt
  :language: kotlin
  :emphasize-lines: 5-6

.. note:: 

   :ref:`Primary keys <kotlin-primary-keys>` are indexed by default.

Indexes support the efficient execution of queries in Realm Database.
Without indexes, Realm Database must perform a *collection scan*, i.e.
scan every document in a collection, to select those documents that
match a query. If an appropriate index exists for a query, Realm
Database can use the index to limit the number of documents that it
must inspect.

Indexes are special data structures that store a small portion of a realm's data
in an easy to traverse form. The index stores the value of a specific field
ordered by the value of the field. The ordering of the index entries supports
efficient equality matches and range-based query operations. 

You can index fields with the following types:

- ``String``
- ``Byte``
- ``Short``
- ``Int``
- ``Long``
- ``Boolean``
- ``RealmInstant``
- ``ObjectId``
- ``RealmUUID``

.. _kotlin-fts-index:

Full Text Search Indexes
------------------------

In addition to standard indexes, Realm also supports Full-Text Search 
(FTS) indexes on ``string`` properties. While you can query a string 
field with or without a standard index, an FTS index enables searching 
for multiple words and phrases and excluding others.

For more information on querying full-text indexes, see 
:ref:`Filter with Full Text Search <kotlin-filter-fts>`.

To create a FTS index on a property, use the :kotlin-sdk:`@FullText
<library-base/-realm%20-kotlin%20-s-d-k/io.realm.kotlin.types.annotations
/-full-text/index.html>` annotation. This enables full-text queries
on the property. In the following example, we mark the ``genre`` 
property with the FTS annotation:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/ReadTest.snippet.kotlin-fts-property.kt
  :language: kotlin
  :emphasize-lines: 7-8

.. note:: Character Limitations for FTS Index

  For Full Text Search (FTS) indexes, only ASCII and Latin-1 alphanumerical 
  chars are included in the index (most western languages). See the :kotlin-sdk:`@FullText 
  <library-base/-realm%20-kotlin%20-s-d-k/io.realm.kotlin.types.annotations/
  -full-text/index.html>` for more information on current FTS index constraints.

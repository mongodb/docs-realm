You can use the :java-sdk:`RealmSet <io/realm/RealmSet.html>` data type
to manage a collection of unique keys. ``RealmSet`` implements Java's
``Set`` interface, so it works just like the built-in ``HashSet`` class,
except managed ``RealmSet`` instances persist their contents to a
realm. ``RealmSet`` instances that contain Realm objects
actually only store references to those objects, so deleting a
Realm object from a realm also deletes that object from
any ``RealmSet`` instances that contain the object.

Because ``RealmSet`` implements ``RealmCollection``, it has some useful
mathematical methods, such as ``sum``, ``min``, and ``max``. For a complete
list of available ``RealmSet`` methods, see: :java-sdk:`the RealmSet API 
reference <io/realm/RealmSet.html>`.

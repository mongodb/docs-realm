To delete an object from a realm:

1. Open a write transaction with `realm.write()
   <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin/-realm/write.html>`__ or
   `realm.writeBlocking()
   <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin/-realm/write-blocking.html>`__.

#. Query the transaction's mutable realm for the object you want to delete
   with `realm.query()
   <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.query/-realm-query/query.html>`__.
   Specify the object type as a type parameter passed to :file:`query()`.
   Filter the set of returned objects by specifying a query. To ensure
   your query returns the correct object, filter with unique identifying
   information such as a primary key value.

#. Delete the set of `RealmResults
   <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin/-realm-results/index.html>`__
   returned by the query with `realmResults.delete()
   <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin/-realm-results/delete.html>`__.

Any modern app should be able to react when data changes,
regardless of where that change originated. When a user adds a new item to a list,
you may want to update the UI, show a notification, or log a message.
When someone updates that item, you may want to change its visual state
or fire off a network request.
Finally, when someone deletes the item, you probably want to remove it from the UI.
Realm's notification system allows you to watch for and react to changes in your data,
independent of the writes that caused the changes.

The frozen architecture of the Kotlin SDK makes notifications even more
important. Because the Kotlin SDK doesn't have live objects that update
automatically, you'll use notifications to update your data layer.

You can subscribe to changes on the following events:

- :ref:`Query on collection <kotlin-query-change-listener>`
- :ref:`Realm object <kotlin-realm-object-change-listener>`
- :ref:`List in a Realm object <kotlin-realm-list-change-listener>`

.. example:: About the Examples on This Page

   The examples in this page use two Realm object types, ``Character`` and
   ``Fellowship``:

   The examples have this sample data:

.. _kotlin-query-change-listener:

Register a Query Change Listener
--------------------------------

You can register a notification handler on any query within a Realm.
First, create a Kotlin Flow from the query with `asFlow()
<{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.query/-realm-element-query/as-flow.html>`__.
Next, use the ``collect()`` method to handle events on that Flow. Events
of type ``UpdatedResults`` record all changes to the objects matching the
query using the following properties:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 20 30

   * - Property
     - Type
     - Description

   * - ``insertions``
     - *IntArray*
     - Indexes in the new collection which were added in this version.

   * - ``insertionRanges``
     - *Array<ListChangeSet.Range>*
     - Ranges of indexes in the new collection which were added in this version.

   * - ``changes``
     - *IntArray*
     -  Indexes of the objects in the new collection which were modified in this version.

   * - ``changeRanges``
     - *Array<ListChangeSet.Range>*
     - Ranges of indexes in the new collection which were modified in this version.

   * - ``deletions``
     - *IntArray*
     -  Indexes in the previous version of the collection which have been removed from this one.

   * - ``deletionRanges``
     - *Array<ListChangeSet.Range>*
     - Ranges of indexes in the previous version of the collection which have been removed from this one.

   * - ``list``
     - *RealmResults<T as RealmObject>*
     - Results collection being monitored for changes.

.. _kotlin-realm-object-change-listener:

Register a RealmObject Change Listener
--------------------------------------

You can register a notification handler on a specific object within a realm.
Realm notifies your handler when any of the object's properties change.
To register a change listener on a single object, obtain a `RealmSingleQuery <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.query/-realm-single-query/index.html>`__
with ``realm.query.first()``. Generate a Flow from that query with `asFlow()
<{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.query/-realm-element-query/as-flow.html>`__.
The handler receives a ``SingleQueryChange`` object that communicates
object changes using the following subtypes:

.. list-table::

   * - Subtype
     - Properties
     - Notes

   * - ``UpdatedObject``
     - *changedFields*, *obj*
     - Pass a field name to ``isFieldChanged()`` to check if that field changed.

   * - ``DeletedObject``
     - *obj*
     - Since *obj* always reflects the latest version of the object, it always returns a null value in this subtype.

.. _kotlin-realm-list-change-listener:

Register a RealmList Change Listener
------------------------------------

You can register a notification handler on a list of ``RealmObjects`` within another ``RealmObject``.
Realm notifies your handler when any of the list items change.
First, create a Kotlin Flow from the list with `asFlow()
<{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.types/-realm-list/as-flow.html>`__.
Next, use the ``collect()`` method to handle events on that Flow. Events
of type ``UpdatedList`` record all changes to the list
using the following properties:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 20 30

   * - Property
     - Type
     - Description

   * - ``insertions``
     - *IntArray*
     - Indexes in the new collection which were added in this version.

   * - ``insertionRanges``
     - *Array<ListChangeSet.Range>*
     - Ranges of indexes in the new collection which were added in this version.

   * - ``changes``
     - *IntArray*
     -  Indexes of the objects in the new collection which were modified in this version.

   * - ``changeRanges``
     - *Array<ListChangeSet.Range>*
     - Ranges of indexes in the new collection which were modified in this version.

   * - ``deletions``
     - *IntArray*
     -  Indexes in the previous version of the collection which have been removed from this one.

   * - ``deletionRanges``
     - *Array<ListChangeSet.Range>*
     - Ranges of indexes in the previous version of the collection which have been removed from this one.

   * - ``list``
     - *RealmResults<T as RealmObject>*
     - Results collection being monitored for changes.

.. important::

   You can only apply a change listener to a ``RealmList<T as RealmObject>``.

A **realm** is the core data structure used to organize data in
Realm Database. A realm is a collection of the objects that you use
in your application, called Realm objects, as well as additional metadata
that describe the objects. To learn how to define a Realm object, see
:ref:`Define a Realm Object Schema <flutter-define-realm-object-schema>`.

When you :ref:`open a realm <kotlin-open-and-close-a-realm>`, you can include configuration that specifies additional details
about how to configure the realm file. This includes things like:

- Pass a file path or in-memory identifier to customize how the realm is stored on device
- Provide a logged-in user and Sync details to use Sync with the realm
- Specify the realm use only a subset of your app's classes
- Whether and when to compact a realm to reduce its file size
- Pass an encryption key to encrypt a realm
- Provide a schema version or migration block when making schema changes

Realm Files
-----------

Realm Database stores a binary encoded version of every object and type in a
realm in a single ``.realm`` file. The file is located at a specific
path that you can define when you open the realm.
You can open, view, and edit the contents of these files with
:ref:`realm-studio`.

Realm Database also creates additional files for each realm.
To learn more about these files, see :ref:`Realm Database Internals
<kotlin-realm-database-internals>`. Deleting these files has important implications.

For more information about deleting ``.realm`` or auxiliary files, refer to
:ref:`Delete a Realm <kotlin-delete-a-realm>`.

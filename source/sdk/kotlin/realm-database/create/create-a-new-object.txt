Instantiate Realm objects as you would any other object. In a
transaction, you can add the object to the realm if the
realm's schema includes the object
type. When you add an instance to the realm, it becomes
*managed* by that realm.

To persist a new object to a realm:

1. Instantiate a new object instance with the class constructor. You
   can use an `apply block
   <https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/apply.html>`__
   to configure multiple properties at once.

#. Open a write transaction with `realm.write()
   <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin/-realm/write.html>`__ or
   `realm.writeBlocking()
   <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin/-realm/write-blocking.html>`__.

#. Pass the new object instance to `copyToRealm()
   <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin/-mutable-realm/copy-to-realm.html>`__
   to persist the object data to the realm. This method returns a
   **managed** instance of the object. You can modify the persisted
   object through the returned instance.

.. note::

   You can only insert new objects into a realm within a
   :ref:`write transaction <kotlin-write-transactions>`.

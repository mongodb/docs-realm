Overview
--------

Realm applications model data as objects composed of field-value
pairs that each contain one or more data types or other Realm objects.

The Kotlin SDK memory maps Realm objects directly to native Kotlin 
objects, so there's no need to use a special data access library. 
You define your application's data model via regular Kotlin classes declared
in your application code object. 

To learn about how to make changes to your Realm objects after
defining your Realm object model, refer to 
:ref:`Change an Object Model <kotlin-change-object-model>`.

Object Types & Schemas
----------------------

Realm objects are regular Kotlin classes, and you can work with them 
as you would any other class instance. 

- Every Realm object has an **object type** that refers to the object's class.
- Objects of the same type share an **object schema**, which defines the 
  properties and :ref:`relationships <kotlin-relationships>` for objects of that 
  type.

You define object schemas by using Kotlin class declarations.

.. example::
   
  The following schema defines a ``Car`` object type with 
  ``make``, ``model``, and ``miles`` properties:

Define a New Object Type
------------------------

To define a Realm object type: 

1. Create a uniquely named Kotlin class that implements the 
   `RealmObject <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.types/-realm-object/index.html>`__ 
   or 
   `EmbeddedRealmObject <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.types/-embedded-realm-object/index.html>`__
   interface. 

#. Add fields to your class. You can add any :ref:`supported data types <kotlin-supported-types>` as a field in your class. 
 
#. Add any property annotations to give Realm additional information about a 
   property, including whether Realm should ignore the property or should be indexed.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SchemaTest.snippet.define-object-type.kt
  :language: kotlin

Once you've defined your object model, you can pass the class to the ``schema`` 
property of the 
`RealmConfiguration <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin/-realm-configuration/index.html>`__ 
when you :ref:`open the realm <kotlin-open-a-realm>`.

Property Annotations
--------------------

Use annotations to add functionality to properties in your Realm object models.  

Required and Optional Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Kotlin, value types are implicitly non-nullable. 
You can make properties optional (nullable) using
the built-in ``?`` Kotlin operator.

  :language: kotlin
  :emphasize-lines: 8

Default Field Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can assign a default value to a property in the property declaration.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SchemaTest.snippet.declare-properties.kt
  :language: kotlin
  :emphasize-lines: 10

Specify a Primary Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can specify a property as the object type's primary key. 
The primary key is a unique identifier for an object in a realm. 

To specify a property as a primary key, use the ``@PrimaryKey`` annotation. 
For more information, refer to :ref:`Primary Keys <kotlin-primary-keys>`.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SchemaTest.snippet.declare-properties.kt
  :language: kotlin
  :emphasize-lines: 2-3

Map a Property to a Different Name 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To persist a field under a different property name, 
use the ``@PersistedName`` annotation. 
This is useful when open a Realm across different bindings
where code style conventions can differ. 
For more information, refer to :ref:`Remap a Property <kotlin-remap-a-property>`.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SchemaTest.snippet.declare-properties.kt
  :language: kotlin
  :emphasize-lines: 15-16

Ignore Properties from Realm Schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, Realm manages properties defined in your Realm object model. 

- **Managed properties** are stored or updated in the database.
- **Ignored properties** are *not* stored to the database. 
 
You can mix managed and ignored properties within a class. 

To ignore a property, use the ``@Ignore`` annotation.
For more information, refer to :ref:`Ignore a Field <kotlin-ignore>`.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SchemaTest.snippet.declare-properties.kt
  :language: kotlin
  :emphasize-lines: 12-13

Index Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create an index on a property, use the ``@Index`` annotation. 
For more information, refer to :ref:`Index a Field <kotlin-indices>`.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SchemaTest.snippet.declare-properties.kt
  :language: kotlin
  :emphasize-lines: 5-6

Define Relationship Properties
------------------------------

You can define relationships between Realm objects in your schema. 
The Realm Kotlin SDK supports to-one relationships, to-many relationships, 
inverse relationships, and embedding objects within other objects. 

To learn more about how to define relationships in your Realm object schema, refer to :ref:`Relationships <kotlin-relationships>`.

.. note::

   You can only delete objects from a realm within a
   :ref:`write transaction <kotlin-write-transactions>`.

To delete a realm file, refer to :ref:`Delete a Realm <kotlin-delete-a-realm>`.

.. _kotlin-delete-an-object:

Delete a Single Object
----------------------

To delete an object from a realm:

1. Open a write transaction with `realm.write()
   <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin/-realm/write.html>`__ or
   `realm.writeBlocking()
   <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin/-realm/write-blocking.html>`__.

#. Query the transaction's mutable realm for the object you want to delete
   with `realm.query()
   <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.query/-realm-query/query.html>`__.
   Specify the object type as a type parameter passed to :file:`query()`.
   Filter the set of returned objects by specifying a query. To ensure
   your query returns the correct object, filter with unique identifying
   information such as a primary key value.

#. Pass the set of `RealmResults
   <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.query/-realm-results/index.html>`__
   returned by the query to `mutableRealm.delete() <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin/-mutable-realm/delete.html>`__

.. _kotlin-delete-multiple-objects:

Delete Multiple Objects
-----------------------

To delete multiple objects from a realm at the same time:

1. Open a write transaction with `realm.write()
   <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin/-realm/write.html>`__ or
   `realm.writeBlocking()
   <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin/-realm/write-blocking.html>`__.

#. Query the transaction's mutable realm for the objects you want to delete
   with `realm.query()
   <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.query/-realm-query/query.html>`__.
   Specify the object type as a type parameter passed to :file:`query()`.
   Filter the set of returned objects by specifying a query.

#. Delete the set of `RealmResults
   <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.query/-realm-results/index.html>`__
   returned by the query with `realmResults.delete()
   <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin/-mutable-realm/delete.html>`__.

.. _kotlin-delete-all-objects-of-a-type:

Delete All Objects of a Type
----------------------------

To delete all objects of a type from a realm:

1. Open a write transaction with `realm.write()
   <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin/-realm/write.html>`__ or
   `realm.writeBlocking()
   <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin/-realm/write-blocking.html>`__.

#. Query the transaction's mutable realm for all objects of that type
   with `realm.query()
   <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.query/-realm-query/query.html>`__.
   Specify the object type as a type parameter passed to :file:`query()`.

#. Delete the set of `RealmResults
   <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.query/-realm-results/index.html>`__
   returned by the query with `mutableRealm.delete()
   <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin/-mutable-realm/index.html#-181441016%2FFunctions%2F-1651551339>`__.

.. _kotlin-delete-dictionary-keys-values:

Delete Dictionary Keys/Values
-----------------------------

You can delete 
`RealmDictionary <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.types/-realm-dictionary/index.html>`__ 
entries in a few ways:

- Use ``remove()`` to remove the key and the value
- If the dictionary's value is nullable, you can set the value of the key to ``null`` to keep the key.
- Use ``clear()`` to remove all keys and values

   :language: kotlin

Delete an Embedded Object
-------------------------

.. warning:: Realm Uses Cascading Deletes for Embedded Objects

   When you delete a Realm object, Realm automatically deletes any
   embedded objects referenced by that object. 
   If you want the referenced objects to persist after the deletion of the 
   parent object, use a regular Realm object with a :ref:`to-one relationship 
   <kotlin-to-one-relationship>` instead.

You can delete an 
`EmbeddedRealmObject.parent() <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.ext/parent.html>`__  
directly or through the parent object. 

To delete only an embedded object, you can fetch and delete a specific 
embedded object or clear the parent's reference to the embedded object, 
which also deletes the embedded object instance.  

Deleting the parent object automatically deletes all of its embedded objects.

    :language: kotlin

Delete Items from a RealmSet
----------------------------

:ref:`RealmSet <kotlin-realm-set>` instances that contain Realm objects 
only store references to those objects, so deleting a Realm object from a 
realm also deletes that object from any ``RealmSet`` instances that contain 
the object.

Remove an Item from a RealmSet
``````````````````````````````

To remove an item from a ``RealmSet``, pass the element you want to 
delete to 
`set.remove() <{+kotlin-local-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.types/-realm-set/index.html#-1503494415%2FFunctions%2F-1651551339>`__:

To remove multiple items from a ``RealmSet``, pass the elements you want to

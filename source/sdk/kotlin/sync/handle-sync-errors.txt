While developing an application that uses :ref:`Device Sync <sync>`, you should set an error
handler. This error handler will detect and respond to any failed sync-related
API calls.

Handle Sync Errors
-------------------

Set an error handler through the 
`SyncConfiguration.errorHandler <{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb.sync/-sync-configuration/index.html#872059509%2FProperties%2F645295071>`__
property when creating a synced realm. 
When an error occurs, the Kotlin SDK calls the error handler with the error object
and the `SyncSession <{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb.sync/-sync-session/index.html>`__ 
that the error occurred on. 

If you do not specify an error handler, the default behavior is to print the 
sync error to the console. 

For information about setting a client log level or customizing the logger, refer 
to :ref:`kotlin-client-log-level`.

Sync Exceptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A `SyncException <{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb.exceptions/-sync-exception/index.html>`__ 
is a subclass of `AppException <{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb.exceptions/-app-exception/index.html>`__. 
A ``SyncException`` occurs when Device Sync fails. 

For more information on app exceptions, refer to :ref:`Handle App Errors <kotlin-app-errors>`.

Unrecoverable Sync Errors
`````````````````````````

An `UnrecoverableSyncException <{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb.exceptions/-unrecoverable-sync-exception/index.html>`__ occurs when Device Sync 
fails catastrophically.
This usually means a bug in the client or connected App.

When an unrecoverable sync error occurs, you should surface the problem
to the end user. Let them know that Device Sync won't work until the
problem is solved. It's best to send yourself an alert so you can check
the backend App logs and fix the problem as soon as possible.

Wrong Sync Type Errors
``````````````````````

A `WrongSyncTypeException <{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb.exceptions/-wrong-sync-type-exception/index.html>`__
occurs when the client and App use different sync protocols. 

The SDK supports two kinds of sync: :ref:`flexible sync <enable-flexible-sync>` 
and :ref:`partition based <sync-partitions>` sync. 
When a client connects to an App using a sync type that does not match the App's sync type, a wrong sync type error occurs.

To recover from a wrong sync type error, update the client to use a sync
type that matches the backend. This will most likely require the user
to update to a new version of your app containing the fix. 

Bad Flexible Sync Query Errors
``````````````````````````````

A `BadFlexibleSyncQueryException <{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb.exceptions/-bad-flexible-sync-query-exception/index.html>`__ 
occurs when you try to subscribe to a flexible sync query that is not supported
by the App backend. 
This can happen when you:

- query a field not specified as a **queryable field** in your flexible
  sync configuration
- create a flexible sync query using operators unsupported by flexible
  sync

To recover from a bad flexible sync query error, update your client to
use a sync query compatible with your App configuration. This will most
likely require the user to update to a new version of your app containing
the fix.

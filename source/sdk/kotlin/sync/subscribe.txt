Flexible Sync uses subscriptions and permissions to determine which
data to sync with your App.

Prerequisites
-------------

To use Flexible Sync in the SDK:

- :ref:`Configure Flexible Sync on the backend <enable-flexible-sync>`
- :ref:`Authenticate a user <kotlin-authenticate>` in
  your client app.
- :ref:`Open the synced Realm with a Flexible Sync configuration <kotlin-open-a-synced-realm>`

You can add, update, and remove query subscriptions to determine which data 
syncs to the client device.

Subscriptions
-------------

When you configure Flexible Sync on the backend, you specify which fields
your client application can query. In the client application, use the 
``subscriptions`` API to manage a set of subscriptions to specific queries on 
queryable fields. You can construct queries with
:ref:`Realm Query Language <realm-query-language>`.

.. important::

   Flexible Sync does not support all the operators available in Realm 
   Query Language. See :ref:`Flexible Sync RQL Limitations 
   <kotlin-flexible-sync-rql-limitations>` for details.

You can:

- Add subscriptions
- React to subscription state
- Update subscriptions with new queries
- Remove individual subscriptions or all subscriptions for an object type

Data matching the subscription, where the user has the appropriate 
permissions, syncs between clients and the backend application.

You can specify an optional string name for your subscription.

.. tip:: Always Specify a Subscription Name

   Always specify a subscription name if your application uses multiple
   subscriptions. This makes your subscriptions easier to look up,
   update, and delete elsewhere in your app.

When you create a subscription, Realm looks for data matching a query on a
specific object type. You can create multiple subscription sets on different 
object types, and even query multiple times on the same object type.

Subscription names must be unique. Adding a subscription 
with the same name as an existing subscription throws an error.

.. _kotlin-add-subscription:

Add a Subscription
------------------

Add a subscription in a subscriptions update block. You append each
new subscription to the client's Realm subscriptions.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SyncTest.snippet.add-a-subscription.kt
   :language: kotlin
   :copyable: false

.. important:: Object Links

   You must add both an object and its linked object to the subscription 
   set to see a linked object.
   
   If your subscription results contain an object with a property that links 
   to an object not contained in the results, the link appears to be null.
   There is no way to distinguish whether that property's value is 
   legitimately null, or whether the object it links to exists but is out of
   view of the query subscription.

.. _kotlin-sync-check-subscription-state:

Wait for Subscription Changes to Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Writing an update to the subscription set locally is only one component 
of changing a subscription. After the local subscription change, the client
synchronizes with the server to resolve any updates to the data due to 
the subscription change. This could mean adding or removing data from the 
synced realm. Use the `SynConfiguration.waitForInitialRemoteData()
<{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb.sync/-sync-configuration/-builder/wait-for-initial-remote-data.html>`__
builder method to force your application to block until client subscription
data synchronizes to the backend before opening the realm:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SyncTest.snippet.wait-for-subscription-changes.kt
   :language: kotlin
   :copyable: false

You can also use `SubscriptionSet.waitForSynchronization()
<{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb.sync/-subscription-set/wait-for-synchronization.html>`__
to delay execution until subscription sync completes after instantiating
a sync connection.

``SubscriptionSet.State`` Enum
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Additionally, you can watch the state of the subscription set with the 
`SubscriptionSetState
<{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb.sync/-subscription-set-state/index.html>`__
enum. You can use subscription state to:

- Show a progress indicator while data is downloading
- Find out when a subscription set becomes superseded

You can access the state of your application's subscription set using
``SubscriptionSet.state``.

Superceded
~~~~~~~~~~

``SUPERCEDED`` is a ``SubscriptionSetState`` that can occur when another
thread writes a subscription on a different instance of the 
subscription set. If the state becomes ``SUPERCEDED``, you must obtain 
a new instance of the subscription set before you can write to it.

.. _kotlin-update-subscriptions-with-new-query:

Update Subscriptions with a New Query
-------------------------------------

You can update subscriptions using
`SubscriptionSet.update()
<{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb.sync/-subscription-set/update.html>`__.
In this example, we use `MutableSubscriptionSet.add()
<{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb.sync/-mutable-subscription-set/add.html>`__.
to update the query for the subscription named "subscription name".
You must set the ``updateExisting`` parameter to ``true`` to update
a subscription with ``add()``:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SyncTest.snippet.update-subscriptions-by-name.kt
   :language: kotlin
   :copyable: false

You cannot update subscriptions created without a name. However, you can
look up unnamed subscriptions by their query, remove them from the
subscription set, then add a new subscription with an updated query:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SyncTest.snippet.update-subscriptions-by-query.kt
   :language: kotlin
   :copyable: false

.. _kotlin-remove-subscriptions:

Remove Subscriptions
--------------------

To remove subscriptions, you can:

- Remove a single subscription query
- Remove all subscriptions to a specific object type
- Remove all subscriptions

When you remove a subscription query, Realm asynchronously removes the
synced data that matched the query from the client device.

Remove a Single Subscription
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can remove a specific subscription query
using `MutableSubscriptionSet.remove()
<{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb.sync/-mutable-subscription-set/remove.html>`__.
You can either look up the subscription by name, then pass the returned
subscription to ``remove()``, or pass the subscription name directly to
``remove()``:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SyncTest.snippet.remove-single-subscription.kt
   :language: kotlin
   :copyable: false

Remove All Subscriptions to an Object Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to remove all subscriptions to a specific object type, pass
a class to the `MutableSubscriptionSet.removeAll()
<{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb.sync/-mutable-subscription-set/remove.html>`__.
method:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SyncTest.snippet.remove-all-subscriptions-to-an-object-type.kt
   :language: kotlin
   :copyable: false

Remove All Subscriptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To remove all subscriptions from the subscription set, use
`MutableSubscriptionSet.removeAll()
<{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb.sync/-mutable-subscription-set/remove-all.html>`__.
with no arguments:

.. warning::

   If you remove all subscriptions and do not add a new one, you'll 
   get an error. A realm opened with a flexible sync configuration needs
   at least one subscription to sync with the server.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SyncTest.snippet.remove-all-subscriptions.kt
   :language: kotlin
   :copyable: false

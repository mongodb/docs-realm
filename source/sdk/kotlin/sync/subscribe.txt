:ref:`Flexible Sync <flexible-sync>` uses subscriptions and permissions to determine which
data to sync with your App. This page details how to manage subscriptions for Flexible Sync.

To use Flexible Sync in the SDK:

#. :ref:`Configure Flexible Sync on the backend <enable-flexible-sync>` and define your :ref:`queryable fields <queryable-fields>`.
#. :ref:`Authenticate a user <kotlin-authenticate>` in your client app.
#. :ref:`Open the synced Realm with a Flexible Sync configuration <kotlin-open-a-synced-realm>`
#. :ref:`Add subscriptions to the client application <kotlin-sync-add-subscription>` to indicate which data to sync.

When you configure Flexible Sync on the backend, you specify which 
fields your client application can query using **subscriptions**. 

Each subscription corresponds to a query on **queryable fields** for a 
specific object type. You can create multiple subscriptions on 
different object types and multiple subscriptions on the same 
object type. See :ref:`Queryable Fields <queryable-fields>` 
in the App Services documentation for more information.

For each subscription, Realm looks for data matching the query. 
Data matching the query, where the user has the appropriate 
permissions, syncs between clients and the backend application.

You can construct queries with :ref:`Realm Query Language <realm-query-language>`.

.. important::

   Flexible Sync does not support all the operators available in Realm 
   Query Language. See :ref:`Flexible Sync RQL Limitations 
   <kotlin-flexible-sync-rql-limitations>` for details.

Manage Subscriptions in Your Client App
---------------------------------------

With an authenticated user and a Flexible Sync configuration, you can
open a synced realm and subscribe to queries for the objects you want to read and
write.

In the client application, you add, update, and remove subscriptions to specific 
queries on the queryable fields. This will determine which data syncs to the client device.

.. note::

   .. versionadded:: 1.10.0

   To simplify subscription management, Realm Kotlin SDK version 1.10.0 adds an
   experimental ``.subscribe()`` API to subscribe directly to a ``RealmQuery`` or 
   a ``RealmResults``. This API 
   abstracts away the details of manually adding subscriptions through subscription sets.

You can:

- Add subscriptions with an optional subscription name:
  
  - In Kotlin SDK version 1.10.0 or newer, use ``.subscribe()`` to subscribe to a query and automatically add the subscription to the subscription set
  - Manually add a subscription to the subscription set
  
- React to subscription state
- Update subscriptions with new queries
- Remove individual subscriptions or all subscriptions for an object type

Linked Objects and Asymmetric Objects 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your app uses **linked objects**, you must add both the object itself and its linked 
object to the subscription set to see the actual linked object.
When your subscription results contain an object with a property that links 
to an object not contained in the results, the link appears to be null.
There is no way to distinguish whether that property's value is 
legitimately null or whether the object it links to exists but is out of
view of the query subscription.

If your app uses :ref:`Data Ingest <optimize-data-ingest>` to 
unidirectionally sync **asymmetric objects**, you *cannot* create subscriptions for 
those objects. If you have asymmetric objects and non-asymmetric objects in the 
same realm, you can add a Flexible Sync subscription query for *only* the 
non-asymmetric objects.

About the Examples on This Page
-------------------------------

The examples on this page use a simple data set for a
task list app. The two Realm object types are ``Team``
and ``Task``. A ``Task`` has a ``taskName``, assignee's name, and
completed flag. There is also a count of minutes spent working on it, 
and a due date. A ``Team`` has a ``teamName``, zero or more 
``Tasks``, and a list of ``members``.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SyncTest.snippet.flexible-sync-models.kt
   :language: kotlin

The examples on this page also assume you have an authorized user and a 
Flexible Sync `SyncConfiguration() <{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb.sync/-sync-configuration/index.html>`__:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SyncTest.snippet.open-flex-sync-app.kt
   :language: kotlin

.. _kotlin-flexible-sync-results-subscribe-api:

Subscribe to Queries
--------------------

.. versionadded:: 1.10.0

To simplify subscription management, Realm Kotlin SDK version 1.10.0
adds an experimental 
`.subscribe() <{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb.ext/subscribe.html>`__ 
API to subscribe to a ``RealmQuery`` or ``RealmResults`` set. This API abstracts 
away the details of manually adding and removing subscriptions through subscription sets.

You can:

- Automatically subscribe to a query with an optional name
- Update a named subscription with a new query

If you need more control over subscriptions for performance optimization or 
business logic reasons, you can 
:ref:`manually manage the subscription set <kotlin-manually-manage-subscription>` 
using the ``subscriptions`` API. See the 
:ref:`Performance Considerations <kotlin-flex-sync-performance-considerations>` 
section for more information.

Subscribe to a Query
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can ``.subscribe()`` to a query to create a subscription
for objects matching a specific query:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SyncTest.snippet.subscribe-unnamed-query.kt
   :language: kotlin

This creates an unnamed subscription and adds it to the
``MutableSubscriptionSet``, similar to 
:ref:`manually creating a subscription <kotlin-sync-add-subscription>`.

Subscribe to a Query with a Name
````````````````````````````````

If your app works with multiple subscriptions or if you want to update
a subscription, you may want to add a name when you subscribe to a query.
You can later use this name to :ref:`update the subscription's query 
<kotlin-update-query-subscription>` or :ref:`remove the 
query by name <kotlin-remove-query-by-name>`.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SyncTest.snippet.subscribe-named-query.kt
   :language: kotlin

Wait for a Query Subscription to Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you subscribe to a query's results set, that set does not contain objects until it syncs. If your app creates objects, you may not need to download synced data before the user works with it. However, if your app requires data from the server before the user can work with it, you can specify that a subscription should wait for data to sync:   

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SyncTest.snippet.subscribe-wait-for-sync.kt
   :language: kotlin

This option uses the `WaitForSync <{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb.sync/-wait-for-sync/index.html>`__ enum, whose values are:

- ``FIRST_TIME``: (Default) Wait to download matching objects when your app initially creates the subscription. Otherwise, return without waiting for new downloads. The app must have an internet connection to download the data when you initially add the subscription. You can optionally specify a ``timeout`` value.

- ``ALWAYS``: Wait to download matching objects every time the ``.subscribe()`` method is called. The app must have an internet connection to download the data. You can optionally specify a ``timeout`` value.

- ``NEVER``: Never wait to download matching objects. The app needs an internet connection for the user to authenticate the first time the app launches but can open offline on subsequent launches using cached credentials.

.. _kotlin-update-query-subscription:

Update a Query Subscription
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can update a named query subscription with a new query
by setting ``updateExisting`` to ``true``:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SyncTest.snippet.update-query-by-name.kt
   :language: kotlin

This updates the subscription, similar to :ref:`manually updating a subscription <kotlin-sync-add-subscription>`.

.. _kotlin-manually-manage-subscription:

Manually Manage Subscriptions
-----------------------------

In the client application, use the 
``subscriptions`` API to manually manage a set of subscriptions to specific queries on 
queryable fields, which determine which data syncs to the client device.

To automatically add subscriptions to a ``MutableSubscriptionSet`` directly 
from a ``RealmQuery`` or a ``RealmResults``, you can use 
the :ref:`.subscribe() API <kotlin-flexible-sync-results-subscribe-api>` with 
Kotlin SDK version 1.10.0 or newer.

.. _kotlin-sync-add-subscription:

Add a Subscription
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can add an unnamed subscription or a named subscription.

.. tip:: Specify a Subscription Name

   Always specify a subscription name if your application uses 
   multiple subscriptions. This makes your subscriptions easier to 
   look up, update, and delete elsewhere in your app.

To manually create a subscription, add the subscription in a 
subscriptions update block. You append each
new subscription to the client's Realm subscriptions.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SyncTest.snippet.add-a-subscription.kt
   :language: kotlin

You can also specify a subscription name when you create the subscription: 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SyncTest.snippet.add-a-named-subscription.kt
   :language: kotlin

.. important:: Object Links

   You must add both an object and its linked object to the subscription 
   set to see a linked object.
   
   If your subscription results contain an object with a property that links 
   to an object not contained in the results, the link appears to be null.
   There is no way to distinguish whether that property's value is 
   legitimately null or whether the object it links to exists but is not available
   to the client due to missing subscriptions.

.. _kotlin-sync-add-initial-subscriptions:

Bootstrap the Realm with Initial Subscriptions
``````````````````````````````````````````````

You must have at least one subscription before you can read 
from or write to the realm. You can bootstrap a realm with an 
initial subscription set when you open it with the 
`SyncConfiguration() <{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb.sync/-sync-configuration/index.html>`__.
See :ref:`Open a Synced Realm <kotlin-open-a-synced-realm>` for more information.

Pass the ``initialSubscriptions`` parameter with the 
subscription queries you want to use to bootstrap the realm:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SyncTest.snippet.initialize-subscribe-query-realm-app.kt
   :language: kotlin

If your app needs to rerun this initial subscription every 
time the app starts, you can pass an additional parameter: 
``rerunOnOpen``. This is a boolean that denotes whether the 
initial subscription should re-run every time the 
app starts. You might need to do this to re-run dynamic time 
ranges or other queries that require a re-computation of 
static variables for the subscription.

In this example, we only want incomplete tasks. With
``rerunOnOpen`` set to ``true``, the query dynamically 
recalculates the relevant objects to sync based on the 
desired query results every time the app starts:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SyncTest.snippet.initialize-subscribe-query-realm-app-rerun.kt
   :language: kotlin

.. _kotlin-sync-check-subscription-state:

Wait for Subscription Changes to Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Writing an update to the subscription set locally is only one component 
of changing a subscription. After the local subscription change, the client
synchronizes with the server to resolve any updates to the data due to 
the subscription change. This could mean adding or removing data from the 
synced realm. 

Use the `SyncConfiguration.waitForInitialRemoteData()
<{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb.sync/-sync-configuration/-builder/wait-for-initial-remote-data.html>`__
builder method to force your application to block until client subscription
data synchronizes to the backend before opening the realm:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SyncTest.snippet.wait-for-subscription-changes.kt
   :language: kotlin

You can also use `SubscriptionSet.waitForSynchronization()
<{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb.sync/-subscription-set/wait-for-synchronization.html>`__
to delay execution until subscription sync completes after instantiating
a sync connection.

Subscription Set State
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the `SubscriptionSet.state
<{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb.sync/-subscription-set/index.html#-508547000%2FProperties%2F645295071>`__
property to read the current state of the subscription set.

``SUPERCEDED`` (sic -- note alternate spelling) is a `SubscriptionSetState
<{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb.sync/-subscription-set-state/index.html>`__
that can occur when another thread writes a subscription on a different instance
of the subscription set. If the state becomes ``SUPERCEDED``, you must obtain a
new instance of the subscription set before you can write to it.

.. include:: /includes/note-sync-state-complete.rst

.. _kotlin-update-subscriptions-with-new-query:

Update Subscriptions with a New Query
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can update subscriptions using
`SubscriptionSet.update()
<{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb.sync/-subscription-set/update.html>`__.

In this example, we use `MutableSubscriptionSet.add()
<{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb.sync/-mutable-subscription-set/add.html>`__.
to update the query for the subscription named ``"bob_smith_teams"``.
You must set the ``updateExisting`` parameter to ``true`` to update
a subscription with ``add()``:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SyncTest.snippet.update-subscriptions-by-name.kt
   :language: kotlin

You cannot update subscriptions created without a name. However, you can
look up unnamed subscriptions by their query, remove them from the
subscription set, then add a new subscription with an updated query:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SyncTest.snippet.update-subscriptions-by-query.kt
   :language: kotlin

.. _kotlin-remove-subscriptions:

Remove Subscriptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To remove subscriptions, you can:

- Remove a single subscription query
- Remove all subscriptions to a specific object type
- Remove all subscriptions
- Remove all unnamed subscriptions

When you remove a subscription query, Realm asynchronously removes the
synced data that matched the query from the client device.

.. _kotlin-remove-query-by-name:

Remove a Single Subscription
````````````````````````````

You can remove a specific subscription query
using `MutableSubscriptionSet.remove()
<{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb.sync/-mutable-subscription-set/remove.html>`__.
You can either look up the subscription by name, then pass the returned
subscription to ``remove()``, or pass the subscription name directly to
``remove()``:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SyncTest.snippet.remove-single-subscription.kt
   :language: kotlin

Remove All Subscriptions to an Object Type
``````````````````````````````````````````

If you want to remove all subscriptions to a specific object type, pass
a class to the `MutableSubscriptionSet.removeAll()
<{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb.sync/-mutable-subscription-set/remove.html>`__.
method:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SyncTest.snippet.remove-all-subscriptions-to-an-object-type.kt
   :language: kotlin

Remove All Subscriptions
````````````````````````

To remove all subscriptions from the subscription set, use
`MutableSubscriptionSet.removeAll()
<{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb.sync/-mutable-subscription-set/remove-all.html>`__.
with no arguments:

.. warning::

   If you remove all subscriptions and do not add a new one, you'll 
   get an error. A realm opened with a flexible sync configuration needs
   at least one subscription to sync with the server.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SyncTest.snippet.remove-all-subscriptions.kt
   :language: kotlin

Remove All Unnamed Subscriptions
````````````````````````````````

.. versionadded:: 1.10.0

You may want to remove unnamed subscriptions that are transient or dynamically 
generated, but leave named subscriptions in place.

You can remove all unnamed (anonymous) subscriptions from the subscription set by 
setting ``anonymousOnly`` to ``true`` when you call the ``removeAll`` method:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin/SyncTest.snippet.remove-all-unnamed-subscriptions.kt
   :language: kotlin

Flexible Sync RQL Limitations
-----------------------------

.. include:: /includes/flex-sync-limitations.rst

.. _kotlin-flex-sync-performance-considerations:

Performance Considerations
--------------------------

API Efficiency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Managing multiple subscriptions with the ``.subscribe()`` 
API described in the :ref:`kotlin-flexible-sync-results-subscribe-api` section
is less efficient than performing batch updates when you 
manually manage subscriptions through the subscription set API. For better performance when 
making multiple subscription changes, use the ``subscriptions.update`` API described in the 
:ref:`kotlin-manually-manage-subscription` section.

Group Updates for Improved Performance

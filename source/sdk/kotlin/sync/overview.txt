Overview
--------

Atlas Device Sync automatically synchronizes data between client applications and 
an :ref:`Atlas App Services backend <realm-cloud>`. When a client 
device is online, {+sync-short+} asynchronously synchronizes data in a 
background thread between the device and your backend {+app+}. 

When you use Sync in your client application, your implementation must match 
the Sync Mode you select in your backend {+app+} configuration. The Sync Mode
options are:

- Partition-Based Sync
- Flexible Sync

You can only use one Sync Mode for your application. The Kotlin
SDK only supports Partition-Based Sync.

.. _kotlin-partition-based-sync-fundamentals:

Partition-Based Sync
--------------------

When you select :ref:`Partition-Based Sync <partition-based-sync>` for your 
backend {+app+} configuration, your client implementation must include a 
partition value. This is the value of the :ref:`partition key 
<partition-key>` field you select when you configure Partition-Based Sync. 

The partition value determines which data the client application can access.

You must provide a partition value when you open a synced realm.

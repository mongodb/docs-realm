To access Atlas App Services and use Atlas Device Sync with the Realm Kotlin SDK,
you must first authenticate a user with an App Services authentication provider.

For more information on configuring App Services Authentication,
refer to :ref:`App Services Authentication <users-and-authentication>` in the
Atlas App Services documentation.

.. _kotlin-creating-and-deleting-users:

Create and Delete Users
-----------------------

For all authentication providers other than email/password authentication,
App Services automatically :ref:`registers a user <kotlin-register>`
the first time a user authenticates.
When using the email/password authentication provider, you must
:ref:`manually register a user <kotlin-manage-email-password-users>`.
If a user authenticates via more than one method,
you can :ref:`link the user identities <kotlin-link-user-identities>`
for each method to a single user account.

You can also :ref:`delete users <kotlin-delete-users>`. Deleting a user
removes metadata attached to the user from App Services, but does not delete user-entered
data from the backend.

.. _kotlin-access-the-app-client:

Log Users In and Out
--------------------

Use one or more :ref:`authentication providers <auth-providers>` to :ref:`log
users in and out <kotlin-authenticate>` of your client app. You can:

- Log users in with an existing social account, such as Apple, Facebook,
  or Google.
- Create new user accounts with App Services email/password management
  or your own custom function or custom JWT user management.
- Enable anonymous users to let users access your App Services App without persisting
  user data.

When you have a logged-in user, you can:

- :ref:`Open a synced realm <kotlin-open-a-synced-realm>` with the user's
  configuration object
- :ref:`Run a backend function <kotlin-call-function>` as the logged-in user
- :ref:`Log the user out <kotlin-logout>`
- :ref:`Delete a user <kotlin-delete-users>`

On successful login, the Kotlin SDK caches credentials on the device. You
can bypass the login flow and access the cached user. Use this to open a
realm or call an Atlas Function upon subsequent app opens.

.. _kotlin-get-user-data:

Get User Data
-------------

App Services manages :ref:`user sessions <user-sessions>` with access tokens and refresh tokens.
Client SDKs supply the logic to manage tokens, and provide them with requests.

To learn more about the user object that App Services provides the Kotlin SDK,
refer to the following documentation:

- :ref:`User Objects <user-objects>` in the App Services documentation.
- `User <{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.kotlin.mongodb/-user/index.html>`__ 
  in the Kotlin SDK API reference documentation.

Read and Update Custom User Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can :ref:`associate custom data <custom-user-data>` with a user, 
such as a preferred language or local timezone, and read it from your client application.

For more information on working with custom user data,
refer to :ref:`Custom User Data <kotlin-custom-user-data>`.

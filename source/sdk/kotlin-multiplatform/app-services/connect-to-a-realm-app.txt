The {+app+} client is the interface to the {+backend+}
backend. It provides access to the :ref:`authentication
<kotlin-multiplatform-authenticate>`, and
:ref:`{+sync+} <android-sync-data>`.

.. _kotlin-multiplatform-access-the-app-client:

Access the App Client
---------------------

Pass the {+app+} ID for your {+app+}, which you can :ref:`find in the Realm UI
<find-your-app-id>`.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin-multiplatform/sync/InitializeTest.codeblock.access-app-client.kt
   :language: kotlin

.. note::

   You can create multiple ``App`` instances to connect to multiple
   {+app+}s or to the same {+app+} with different configurations. All
   ``App`` instances that share the same App ID use the same underlying
   connection.

.. _kotlin-multiplatform-app-client-configuration:

Configuration
-------------

For more granular control of the details of your app connection,
such as custom timeouts for connections and keys for local encryption,
use the ``AppConfiguration`` Builder to control details of your ``App``:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/kotlin-multiplatform/sync/InitializeTest.codeblock.advanced-access-app-client.kt
   :language: kotlin

.. note:: 

   For most use cases, you only need your application's App ID to connect
   to {+service+}. The other settings demonstrated here are optional.

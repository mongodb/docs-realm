Overview
--------

A best practice is to copy Realm objects to your component's :reactjs:`state
<docs/state-and-lifecycle.html>`. However, since Realm objects are
live and automatically update in response to changes, you must update the copies
of them to prevent your UI from drifting out of date with underlying data. You can do this by
registering a :ref:`change listener <react-native-change-notifications>` in your
component and updating the state variable when that listener fires.

The Realm React Native SDK does not provide first class support for
global state management systems like `Redux <https://redux.js.org/>`_. 

Learn more about change listener APIs in the
:ref:`React to Changes<react-native-react-to-changes>` documentation.

.. warning::

   Failing to update copies of Realm objects leads to out-of-date data displayed
   in your UI as objects are deleted or changed.

.. tip:: Handling Exceptions Inside a Listener

   To handle exceptions thrown from a change listener, wrap your ``addListener()`` call
   within a :mdn:`try...catch <Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch>` statement. 

Procedure
---------

#. To keep your UI up-to-date with changes to underlying Realm objects,
   declare a state variable for your Realm objects using the
   :reactjs:`useState() <docs/hooks-state.html>` hook.

#. Within the :reactjs:`useEffect() <docs/hooks-effect.html>` hook, set the state variable to
   the initial value of your objects. Then declare a change listener on the
   Realm objects.

#. Finally, return an anonymous cleanup function that you can use to remove the
   change listener and close the Realm. React.js will call this cleanup function when
   the component unmounts.

If you need to access Realm objects in other components further down the component tree,
pass the state variable for your Realm object as a prop or use 
:reactjs:`React Context <docs/context.html>`. 

.. example::

   In the following example, a developer creates an application to manage
   tasks. Within a ``TaskList`` component, define a state variable called
   ``tasks``. The developer wants to display the initial list of tasks already
   saved in the database after the component mounts. To do this, they :ref:`open
   a realm <react-native-open-a-local-realm>` within a ``useEffect`` function and
   then set the ``tasks`` state variable to the initial value of the ``tasks``
   stored in the Realm. 

   The developer registers a change listener to update the state variable when
   changes to the ``tasks`` have been made in the Realm Database. The
   developer then creates some additional tasks. 

   Once the component unmounts, the developer wants to unregister the change
   listener. To do this, they return a cleanup function and call ``task.removeAllListeners()``. 
   Finally they :ref:`close the realm <react-native-close-a-realm>`.

You can call an **Atlas Function** from a client application using Atlas
Device SDK. Functions are serverless JavaScript functions that let you define
and execute server-side logic. These server-side Functions can run in the
context of the authenticated user, and thus honor the rules, roles, and
permissions that you have assigned to your data in Atlas.

For more information on configuring and writing Atlas Functions, refer to
:ref:`Atlas Functions <functions>` in the App Services documentation.

Before You Begin
----------------

#. In an App Services App, :ref:`define an Atlas Function <define-a-function>`.
#. In your client project, :ref:`initialize the App client <sdks-connect-to-atlas>`.
#. Then, :ref:`authenticate a user <sdks-authenticate-users>`. You access
   Functions through the user object.

The example on this page demonstrates calling an :ref:`Atlas Function <functions>` 
named ``sum`` or ``concatenate`` that takes two arguments, sums or concatenates
them, and returns the result:

.. code-block:: javascript

   // concatenate: concatenate two strings
   exports = function(a, b) {
     return a + b;
   };

Call a Function

.. important::

   Make sure to sanitize client data to protect against code injection when using
   Functions.

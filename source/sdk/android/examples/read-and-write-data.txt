   and ``Task``. A ``Project`` has zero or more ``Tasks``.

   See the schema for these two classes, ``Project`` and
   ``Task``, below:

.. _android-realm-database-reads:

Read Operations
---------------

You can, of course, easily read back the data that you have
:ref:`stored <android-realm-database-writes>` in :term:`{+client-database+}`.
The standard data access pattern across {+service+}
SDKs is to find, filter, and sort objects, in that order. To
get the best performance from {+service+} as your app grows and
your queries become more complex, design your app's data
access patterns around a solid understanding of {+client-database+}
:ref:`read characteristics <android-realm-read-characteristics>`.

.. _android-realm-read-characteristics:

Read Characteristics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you design your app's data access patterns around the
following three key characteristics of reads in {+client-database+},
you can be confident you are reading data as
efficiently as possible.

.. _android-results-are-not-copies:

Results Are Not Copies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Results to a query are not copies of your data: modifying
the results of a query will modify the data on disk
directly. This memory mapping also means that results are
**live**: that is, they always reflect the current state on
disk.

See also: :ref:`Collections are Live <android-live-collections>`.

.. _android-results-are-lazy:

Results Are Lazy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+client-database+} defers execution of a query until you access the
results. You can chain several filter and sort operations
without requiring extra work to process the intermediate
state.

See also: :ref:`Results are Lazily Evaluated
<android-lazy-evaluated-results>`.

.. _android-references-retained:

References Are Retained
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One benefit of {+client-database+}'s object model is that
{+client-database+} automatically retains all of an object's
:ref:`relationships <android-client-relationships>` as
direct references, so you can traverse your graph of
relationships directly through the results of a query.

A **direct reference**, or pointer, allows you to access a
related object's properties directly through the reference.

Other databases typically copy objects from database storage
into application memory when you need to work with them
directly. Because application objects contain direct
references, you are left with a choice: copy the object
referred to by each direct reference out of the database in
case it's needed, or just copy the foreign key for each
object and query for the object with that key if it's
accessed. If you choose to copy referenced objects into
application memory, you can use up a lot of resources for
objects that are never accessed, but if you choose to only
copy the foreign key, referenced object lookups can cause
your application to slow down.

{+client-database+} bypasses all of this using :term:`zero-copy`
:term:`live objects`. :term:`{+service-short+} object` accessors point directly into
database storage using memory mapping, so there is no distinction
between the objects in {+client-database+} and the results of your query in
application memory. Because of this, you can traverse direct references
across an entire {+realm+} from any query result.

.. _android-read-from-realm:

Read from Realm Database
------------------------

A read from a :term:`{+realm+}` generally consists of the following
steps:

- Get all :ref:`objects <android-realm-objects>` of a certain type from the {+realm+}.
- Optionally, :ref:`filter <android-filter-results>` the results using the :ref:`query engine <android-client-query-engine>`.
- Optionally, :ref:`sort <android-sort-results>` the results.

All query, filter, and sort operations return a
:ref:`results collection <android-results-collections>`. The results
collections are live, meaning they always contain the latest
results of the associated query.

.. _android-find-a-specific-object-by-primary-key:

Find a Specific Object by Primary Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To find an object with a specific primary key value, open a {+realm+}
and query the primary key field for the desired primary key value
using the :java-sdk:`RealmQuery.equalTo() <io/realm/RealmQuery.html#equalTo-java.lang.String-Decimal128->` method:

.. _android-query-all-objects-of-a-given-type:

Query All Objects of a Given Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first step of any read is to **get all objects** of a
certain type in a {+realm+}. With this results collection, you
can operate on all instances on a type or filter and sort to
refine the results.

.. example::

   In order to access all instances of ``Project`` and ``Task``, use
   the :java-sdk:`where() <io/realm/RealmResults.html#where-->` method
   to specify a class:

             :language: kotlin

.. _android-filter-queries-based-on-object-properties:
.. _android-filter-results:

Filter Queries Based on Object Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **filter** selects a subset of results based on the
value(s) of one or more object properties. {+client-database+} provides a
full-featured :ref:`query engine <android-client-query-engine>` you
can use to define filters. The most common use case is to
find objects where a certain property matches a certain
value. Additionally, you can compare strings, aggregate over
collections of numbers, and use logical operators to build
up complex queries.

.. example::

   In the following example, we use the query
   engine's comparison operators to:

   - Find high priority tasks by comparing the value of the ``priority`` property value with a threshold number, above which priority can be considered high.
   - Find just-started or short-running tasks by seeing if the ``progressMinutes`` property falls within a certain range.
   - Find unassigned tasks by finding tasks where the ``assignee`` property is equal to null.
   - Find tasks assigned to specific teammates Ali or Jamie by seeing if the ``assignee`` property is in a list of names.

.. _android-sort-results:

Sort Query Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **sort** operation allows you to configure the order in
which {+client-database+} returns queried objects. You can sort based on
one or more properties of the objects in the results
collection.

{+client-database+} only guarantees a consistent order of results when the
results are sorted.

.. example::

   The following code sorts the projects by name in reverse
   alphabetical order (i.e. "descending" order).

.. _android-write-operations:
.. _android-realm-database-writes:

Write Operations
----------------

Overview
--------

:term:`{+client-database+}` uses a highly efficient storage engine
to persist objects. You can **create** objects in a :term:`{+realm+}`,
**update** objects in a {+realm+}, and eventually **delete**
objects from a {+realm+}. Because these operations modify the
state of the {+realm+}, we call them writes.

{+client-database+} handles writes in terms of **transactions**. A
transaction is a list of read and write operations that
{+client-database+} treats as a single indivisible operation. In other
words, a transaction is *all or nothing*: either all of the
operations in the transaction succeed or none of the
operations in the transaction take effect.

.. note::
   
   All writes must happen in a transaction.

A {+realm+} allows only one open transaction at a time. {+client-database+}
blocks other writes on other threads until the open
transaction is complete. Consequently, there is no race
condition when reading values from the {+realm+} within a
transaction.

When you are done with your transaction, {+client-database+} either
**commits** it or **cancels** it:

- When {+client-database+} **commits** a transaction, {+client-database+} writes
  all changes to disk. For :term:`synced {+realms+} <{+sync+}>`, {+client-database+} queues the change
  for synchronization with :term:`{+service+}`.
- When {+client-database+} **cancels** a write transaction or an operation in
  the transaction causes an error, all changes are discarded
  (or "rolled back").

.. _android-open-a-transaction:

Run a Transaction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+client-database+} represents each transaction as a callback function
that contains zero or more read and write operations. To run
a transaction, define a transaction callback and pass it to
the {+realm+}'s ``write`` method. Within this callback, you are
free to create, read, update, and delete on the {+realm+}. If
the code in the callback throws an exception when {+client-database+} runs
it, {+client-database+} cancels the transaction. Otherwise, {+client-database+} commits
the transaction immediately after the callback.

.. important:: Concurrency Concerns

   Since transactions block each other, it is best to avoid
   opening transactions on both the UI thread and a
   background thread. If you are using :doc:`Sync
   </sync>`, avoid opening transactions on the
   UI thread altogether, as {+client-database+} processes synchronizations
   on a background thread. If a background transaction
   blocks your UI thread's transaction, your app may appear
   unresponsive.

.. example::

   The following code shows how to run a transaction with
   :java-sdk:`executeTransaction() <io/realm/Realm.html#executeTransaction-io.realm.Realm.Transaction->`
   or :java-sdk:`executeTransactionAsync() <io/realm/Realm.html#executeTransactionAsync-io.realm.Realm.Transaction->`.
   If the code in the callback throws an exception, {+client-database+}
   cancels the transaction. Otherwise, {+client-database+} commits the
   transaction.

.. _android-create-a-new-object:

Create a New Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instantiate :ref:`{+service-short+} objects
<android-realm-objects>` as you would any other object. In a
transaction, you can add the object to the {+realm+} if the
{+realm+}'s :ref:`schema <android-realm-schema>` includes the object
type. When you add an instance to the {+realm+}, it becomes
*managed* by that {+realm+}.

With the Java and JavaScript SDKs, instead use the {+realm+}'s
factory method in a transaction to instantiate your class.
This automatically inserts the instance into the {+realm+}.

.. example::

   This code demonstrates how to create an object with 
   :java-sdk:`createObject() <io/realm/Realm.html#createObject-java.lang.Class-java.lang.Object->`:

.. _android-modify-an-object:
.. _android-update:

Modify an Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Within a transaction, you can update a {+service-short+} object the same
way you would update any other object in your language of
choice. Just assign a new value to the property or update
the property.

.. example::

   This code changes the turtle's name to "Archibald" and
   sets Archibald's age to 101 by assigning new values to properties:

.. _android-upsert:

Upsert an Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An **upsert** is a write operation that either inserts a new object
with a given primary key or updates an existing object that already has
that primary key. We call this an upsert because it is an "**update** or
**insert**" operation. This is useful when an object may or may not
already exist, such as when bulk importing a dataset into an existing
{+realm+}. Upserting is an elegant way to update existing entries while
adding any new entries.

.. example::

   This code demonstrates how to upsert an object with
   {+realm+}. We create a new turtle enthusiast named "Drew" and then
   update their name to "Andy" using :java-sdk:`insertOrUpdate()
   <io/realm/Realm.html#insertOrUpdate-io.realm.RealmModel->`:

.. _android-batch-update:

Update a Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+client-database+} supports collection-wide updates. A collection update
applies the same update to specific properties of several
objects in a collection at once.

.. example::

   The following code demonstrates how to update a
   collection. Thanks to the :ref:`implicit inverse
   relationship <android-inverse-relationship>` between the Turtle's
   ``owner`` property and the TurtleEnthusiast's ``turtles`` property,
   {+client-database+} automatically updates Josephine's list of turtles
   when you use :java-sdk:`setObject()
   <io/realm/RealmResults.html#setObject-java.lang.String-io.realm.RealmModel->`
   to update the "owner" property for all turtles in the collection.

.. _android-delete-an-object:

Delete an Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To delete an object from a {+realm+}, use either the dynamic or static
versions of the ``deleteFromRealm()`` method of a :java-sdk:`RealmObject
<io/realm/RealmObject.html>` subclass.

.. important:: Do not use objects after delete

   {+client-database+} throws an error if you try to use an object after
   it has been deleted.

.. example::

   its {+realm+} with :java-sdk:`deleteFromRealm()

.. _android-delete-multiple-objects:

Delete Multiple Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To delete an object from a {+realm+}, use the ``deleteAllFromRealm()``
method of the :java-sdk:`RealmResults <io/realm/RealmResults.html>`
instance that contains the objects you would like to delete. You can
filter the ``RealmResults`` down to a subset of objects using the
:java-sdk:`where() <io/realm/Realm.html#where-java.lang.Class->` method.

.. example::

   The following code demonstrates how to delete a
   collection from a {+realm+} with :java-sdk:`deleteAllFromRealm()

.. _android-delete-object-and-dependent-objects:

Delete an Object and its Dependent Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes, you have :ref:`dependent objects
<android-client-relationships>` that you want to delete when
you delete the parent object. We call this a **cascading
delete**. {+client-database+} does not delete the dependent
objects for you. If you do not delete the objects yourself,
they will remain orphaned in your {+realm+}. Whether or not
this is a problem depends on your application's needs.

Currently, the best way to delete dependent objects is to
iterate through the dependencies and delete them before
deleting the parent object.

.. example::

   The following code demonstrates how to perform a
   cascading delete by first deleting all of Ali's turtles,
   then deleting Ali:

Delete All Objects in a Realm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible to delete all objects from the {+realm+}. This
does not affect the schema of the {+realm+}. This is useful for
quickly clearing out your {+realm+} while prototyping.

   The following code demonstrates how to delete everything
   from a {+realm+} with :java-sdk:`deleteAll()
   <io/realm/Realm.html#deleteAll-->`:

Summary
-------

- {+client-database+} handles writes in terms of **transactions**. All writes must occur in a transaction.
- {+client-database+} transactions are ACID compliant.
- To write to {+client-database+}, define the transaction in a callback function that you pass to the {+realm+}'s ``write`` method.

{+service+} applications model data as objects composed of field-value pairs
that each contain one or more :ref:`supported <android-supported-data-types>`
data types. :term:`{+service-short+} objects <Realm object>` behave like
regular Java or Kotlin objects, but they also include additional features like
:ref:`real-time updating data views <android-live-object>` and reactive
:ref:`change event handlers <android-client-notifications>`. To define
a {+service-short+} object in your application, create a subclass of
:java-sdk:`RealmObject <io/realm/RealmObject.html>` or implement
:java-sdk:`RealmModel <io/realm/RealmModel.html>`.

Objects of the same class share an :ref:`object schema
<android-object-schema>` that defines the fields and relationships of those
objects. Define your own object schemas :ref:`using Kotlin and
Java class declarations <create-schema-from-rom>`. Every {+realm+} has a
schema that consists of one or more object schemas describing the
different forms of object that can be stored in that {+realm+}.

Example
-------

.. example::

   The following code block shows an object schema that describes a Dog.
   Every Dog object must include a ``name`` and ``age`` and may
   optionally include the dog's ``breed`` and a reference to a Person
   object that represents the dog's ``owner``.

Primary Keys
------------

{+service-short+} treats fields marked with the
:java-sdk:`@PrimaryKey <io/realm/annotations/PrimaryKey.html>` annotation
as primary keys for their corresponding object schema. Primary keys are
subject to the following limitations:

- You can define only one primary key per object schema.

- Primary key values must be unique across all instances of an object
  in a {+realm+}. Attempting to insert a duplicate primary key value
  results in a :java-sdk:`RealmPrimaryKeyConstraintException
  <io/realm/exceptions/RealmPrimaryKeyConstraintException.html>`.

- Primary key values are immutable. To change the primary key value of
  an object, you must delete the original object and insert a new object
  with a different primary key value.

- :ref:`Embedded objects <android-embedded-objects>` cannot define a
  a primary key.

   :ref:`Usage Example: Primary Key <android-primary-key>`

Optionality
-----------

Fields marked with Java object types and Kotlin nullable types
(ending with ``?``) are nullable by default. All other types
(primitives, non-nullable Kotlin object types) are required by default.
You can mark a nullable field with the :java-sdk:`@Required <io/realm/annotations/Required.html>`
annotation to prevent that field from holding a null value.
:java-sdk:`RealmList <io/realm/RealmList.html>`s are never nullable, but
you can use the ``@Required`` annotation to prevent objects in a list
from holding a null value, even if the base type would otherwise allow it.
You cannot mark a ``RealmList`` of ``RealmObject`` subtypes as required.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`Usage Example: Required <android-required-fields>`

Relationships
-------------

You can model **one-to-one** relationships in realm with
:java-sdk:`RealmObject <io/realm/RealmObject.html>` fields.
You can model **one-to-many** and **many-to-one** relationships
:java-sdk:`RealmList <io/realm/RealmList.html>` fields.
Inverse relationships are the opposite end of a **one-to-many** or
**many-to-one** relationship.
You can make **inverse** relationships traversable with the
:java-sdk:`@LinkingObjects <io/realm/annotations/LinkingObjects.html>`
annotation on a :java-sdk:`RealmResults <io/realm/RealmResults.html>`
field. In an instance of a ``RealmObject``, inverse relationship fields
contain the set of {+service-short+} objects that point to that object
instance through the described relationship. You can find the same set
of {+service-short+} objects with a manual query, but the inverse
relationship field reduces boilerplate query code and capacity for error.

   :ref:`Usage Example: Define a Relationship Property <android-relationships>`

Indexes
-------

{+service-short+} creates indexes for fields annotated with
:java-sdk:`@Index <io/realm/annotations/Index.html>`. Indexes speed up
some queries, but have a negative impact on insert and update operation
speed. Indexes also consume additional space on disk.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`Usage Example: Index a Field <android-index-field>`

Modules
-------

{+service-short+} Modules describe the set of {+service-short+} objects
that can be stored in a {+realm+}. By default, {+service-short+}
automatically creates a {+service-short+} Module that contains all
{+service-short+} objects defined in your application.
You can define a :java-sdk:`RealmModule <io/realm/annotations/RealmModule.html>`
to restrict a {+realm+} to a subset of classes defined in an application.
If you produce a library that uses {+service-short+}, you can use a
{+service-short+} Module to explicitly include only the {+service-short+}
objects defined in your library in your {+realm+}. This allows
applications that include your library to also use {+service-short+}
without managing object name conflicts and migrations with your library's
defined {+service-short+} objects.

   :ref:`Usage Example: Omit Classes from your Realm Schema <android-omit-classes-from-schema>`

Summary
-------

- {+service-short+} objects are of a **type** defined as you would any other
  class.

- {+service-short+} objects are **live**: they always reflect the latest version
  on disk and update automatically when the underlying object changes.

- The {+service-short+} object's **schema** defines the fields of the object and
  which fields are optional, which fields have a default value,
  and which fields are indexed.

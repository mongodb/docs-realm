An **object schema** is a configuration object that defines the fields and
relationships of a {+service-short+} object type. Android
{+service-short+} applications define object schemas with Java or Kotlin
classes using :term:`{+frontend-schema+}s <{+frontend-schema+}>`.

Object schemas specify constraints on object fields such as the data
:ref:`type <android-supported-data-types>` of each field, whether a
field is required, and default field values. Schemas can also define
:ref:`relationships <android-client-relationships>` between object types in
a {+realm+}.

Modifying your application's {+frontend-schema+} requires you to
:ref:`migrate <android-schema-versions-and-migrations>` data from older
versions of your {+frontend-schema+} to the new version.

Realm Apps
----------

Every {+app+} has a :ref:`{+backend-schema+} <android-realm-schema>`
composed of a list of object schemas for each type of object that the
{+realms+} in that application may contain.

{+service+} guarantees that all objects in a {+realm+} conform to the
schema for their object type and validates objects whenever they're
created, modified, or deleted.

{+app+}s that take advantage of {+sync+} can define schemas in two ways:

- object schemas :ref:`using Kotlin and Java class declarations
  <create-schema-from-rom>` with :ref:`Development Mode <enable-development-mode>`.

- JSON :ref:`object schemas <object-schema>` in your {+app+} backend.

.. _android-primary-key-fundamentals:

Primary Keys
------------

.. versionadded:: Since version 10.6.0, {+client-database+} automatically indexes primary keys.

{+service-short+} treats fields marked with the
:java-sdk:`@PrimaryKey <io/realm/annotations/PrimaryKey.html>` annotation
as primary keys for their corresponding object schema. Primary keys are
subject to the following limitations:

- You can define only one primary key per object schema.

- Primary key values must be unique across all instances of an object
  in a {+realm+}. Attempting to insert a duplicate primary key value
  results in a :java-sdk:`RealmPrimaryKeyConstraintException
  <io/realm/exceptions/RealmPrimaryKeyConstraintException.html>`.

- Primary key values are immutable. To change the primary key value of
  an object, you must delete the original object and insert a new object
  with a different primary key value.

- :ref:`Embedded objects <android-embedded-objects>` cannot define a
  primary key.

You can create a primary key with any of the following types:

- ``String``
- ``UUID``
- ``ObjectId``
- ``Integer`` or ``int``
- ``Long`` or ``long``
- ``Short`` or ``short``
- ``Byte`` or ``byte[]``

Using a ``String`` as a primary key implicitly
:ref:`indexes <android-indexes-fundamentals>` the field.

Non-primitive types can contain a value of ``null`` as a primary key
value, but only for one object of a particular type, since each primary
key value must be unique. Attempting to insert an object with an existing
primary key into a {+realm+} will result in a
:java-sdk:`RealmPrimaryKeyConstraintException <io/realm/exceptions/RealmPrimaryKeyConstraintException.html>`.

{+client-database+} automatically :ref:`indexes <android-index-field>`
primary key fields, which allows you to efficiently read and modify
objects based on their primary key.

You cannot change the primary key field for an object type after adding
any object of that type to a {+realm+}. If you are using {+sync+},
you cannot change the primary key field for an object after defining the
primary key in your backend :doc:`Realm Schema </mongodb/document-schemas>`.

Embedded objects cannot contain primary keys.

.. _android-optionality:

Optionality
-----------

You can make a field required to disallow ``null`` values in a field.
Fields marked with Java object types and Kotlin nullable types
(ending with ``?``) are nullable by default. All other types
(primitives, non-nullable Kotlin object types) are required by default.
You can mark a nullable field with the :java-sdk:`@Required <io/realm/annotations/Required.html>`
annotation to prevent that field from holding a null value.
:java-sdk:`RealmLists <io/realm/RealmList.html>` are never nullable, but
you can use the ``@Required`` annotation to prevent objects in a list
from holding a null value, even if the base type would otherwise allow it.
You cannot mark a ``RealmList`` of ``RealmObject`` subtypes as required.

You can make any of the following types required:

- ``String``
- ``UUID``
- ``ObjectId``
- ``Integer``
- ``Long``
- ``Short``
- ``Byte`` or ``byte[]``
- ``Boolean``
- ``Float``
- ``Double``
- ``Date``
- ``RealmList``

Primitive types such as ``int`` and the ``RealmList`` type are
implicitly required. Fields with the ``RealmObject`` type are always
nullable, and cannot be made required.

.. warning:: Kotlin Types and Nullability

   In Kotlin, types are non-nullable by default unless you explicitly
   add a ``?`` suffix to the type. You can only annotate
   :ref:`nullable types <android-optional-field>`. Using the
   ``@Required`` annotation on non-nullable types will fail compilation.

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: kotlin

      In Kotlin, fields are considered nullable only if a field is
      marked nullable with the Kotlin `? operator
      <https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/null-safety.html>`__ except
      for the following types:

      - ``String``
      - ``Date``
      - ``UUID``
      - ``ObjectId``
      - ``Decimal128``
      - ``RealmAny``

      You can require any type that ends with the Kotlin ``?``
      operator, such as ``Int?``.

      The ``RealmList`` type is non-nullable by default and cannot be
      made nullable.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: java

      Nullable fields are optional by default in {+client-database+}, unless
      otherwise specified with the :ref:`@Required <android-required-field>`
      annotation. The following types are nullable:

      - ``String``
      - ``Date``
      - ``UUID``
      - ``ObjectId``
      - ``Integer``
      - ``Long``
      - ``Short``
      - ``Byte`` or ``byte[]``
      - ``Boolean``
      - ``Float``
      - ``Double``

      Primitive types like ``int`` and ``long`` are non-nullable by
      default and cannot be made nullable, as they cannot be set to a
      null value.

.. _android-relationships-fundamentals:

Relationships
-------------

You can model **one-to-one** relationships in realm with
:java-sdk:`RealmObject <io/realm/RealmObject.html>` fields.
You can model **one-to-many** and **many-to-one** relationships
:java-sdk:`RealmList <io/realm/RealmList.html>` fields.
Inverse relationships are the opposite end of a **one-to-many** or
**many-to-one** relationship.
You can make **inverse** relationships traversable with the
:java-sdk:`@LinkingObjects <io/realm/annotations/LinkingObjects.html>`
annotation on a :java-sdk:`RealmResults <io/realm/RealmResults.html>`
field. In an instance of a ``RealmObject``, inverse relationship fields
contain the set of {+service-short+} objects that point to that object
instance through the described relationship. You can find the same set
of {+service-short+} objects with a manual query, but the inverse
relationship field reduces boilerplate query code and capacity for error.

   - :ref:`Usage Example: Define a Relationship Field <android-relationships>`

.. _android-indexes-fundamentals:

Indexes
-------

**Indexes** support the efficient execution of queries in
{+client-database+}. Without indexes, {+client-database+} must perform a
*collection scan*, i.e. scan every document in a collection, to select
those documents that match a query. If an appropriate index exists for a
query, {+client-database+} can use the index to limit the number of
documents that it must inspect.

Indexes are special data structures that store a small portion of a
{+realm+}'s data in an easy to traverse form. The index stores the value
of a specific field ordered by the value of the field. The ordering of
the index entries supports efficient equality matches and range-based
query operations.

Adding an index to a field makes writing slightly slower, but makes
certain queries faster. Indexes require space in your {+realm+} file, so
adding an index to a field will increase disk space consumed by your
{+realm+} file.

You can index fields with the following types:

- ``String``
- ``UUID``
- ``ObjectId``
- ``Integer`` or ``int``
- ``Long`` or ``long``
- ``Short`` or ``short``
- ``Byte`` or ``byte[]``
- ``Boolean`` or ``bool``
- ``Date``
- ``RealmAny``

{+service-short+} creates indexes for fields annotated with
:java-sdk:`@Index <io/realm/annotations/Index.html>`. Indexes speed up
some queries, but have a negative impact on insert and update operation
speed. Indexes also consume additional space on disk.

.. _android-modules:

Modules
-------

{+service-short+} Modules describe the set of {+service-short+} objects
that can be stored in a {+realm+}. By default, {+service-short+}
automatically creates a {+service-short+} Module that contains all
{+service-short+} objects defined in your application.
You can define a :java-sdk:`RealmModule <io/realm/annotations/RealmModule.html>`
to restrict a {+realm+} to a subset of classes defined in an application.
If you produce a library that uses {+service-short+}, you can use a
{+service-short+} Module to explicitly include only the {+service-short+}
objects defined in your library in your {+realm+}. This allows
applications that include your library to also use {+service-short+}
without managing object name conflicts and migrations with your library's
defined {+service-short+} objects.

.. _android-realm-objects:

Realm Objects
-------------

Unlike normal Java objects, which contain their own data, a
{+service-short+} object doesn’t contain data. Instead,
{+service-short+} objects read and write properties directly to
{+client-database+}.

Instances of Realm objects can be either **managed** or **unmanaged**.

- **Managed** objects are:

  - persisted in {+client-database+}

  - always up to date

  - thread-confined

  - generally more lightweight than the unmanaged version, as they take
    up less space on the Java heap.

- **Unmanaged** objects are just like ordinary Java objects, since
  they are not persisted and never update automatically.
  You can move unmanaged objects freely across threads.

You can convert between the two states using
:java-sdk:`realm.copyToRealm()
<io/realm/Realm.html#copyToRealm-E-io.realm.ImportFlag...->`
and :java-sdk:`realm.copyFromRealm()
<io/realm/Realm.html#copyFromRealm-E->`.

.. _android-realm-proxy:

RealmProxy
~~~~~~~~~~

The ``RealmProxy`` classes are the {+service-short+} SDK's way of
ensuring that {+service-short+} objects don't contain any data
themselves. Instead, each class's ``RealmProxy`` accesses data directly
in the database.

For every model class in your project, the {+service-short+} annotation
processor generates a corresponding ``RealmProxy`` class. This class
extends your model class and is returned when you call
``Realm.createObject()``. In your code, this object works just like your
model class.

.. _android-realm-object-limitations:

Realm Object Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+service-short+} objects:

- cannot contain fields that use the ``final`` or ``volatile`` modifiers
  (except for :ref:`inverse relationship <android-inverse-relationship>`
  fields).

- cannot extend any object other than ``RealmObject``.

- must contain an empty constructor (if your class does not include any
  constructor, the automatically generated empty constructor will suffice)

Naming limitations:

- Class names cannot exceed 57 characters.

- Class names must be unique within :ref:`realm modules <android-modules>`

- Field names cannot exceed 63 characters.

Size limitations:

- ``String`` or ``byte[]`` fields cannot exceed 16 MB.

Usage limitations:

- Because {+service-short+} objects are live and can change at any time,
  their ``hashCode()`` value can change over time. As a result, you
  should not use ``RealmObject`` instances as a key in any map or set.

Incremental Builds
------------------

The bytecode transformer used by {+service-short+} supports incremental
builds, but your application requires a full rebuild when adding or
removing the following from a {+service-short+} object field:

- an ``@Ignore`` annotation

- the ``static`` keyword

- the ``transient`` keyword

You can perform a full rebuild with :guilabel:`Build > Clean Project`
and :guilabel:`Build > Rebuild Project` in these cases.

Summary
-------

- {+service-short+} objects are of a **type** defined as you would any other
  class.

- The {+service-short+} object's **schema** defines the fields of the object and
  which fields are optional, which fields have a default value,
  and which fields are indexed.

- You can define to-one, to-many, and inverse relationships in your schema. Inverse relationships automatically
  form backlinks.

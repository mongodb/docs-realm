A **{+realm+}** is a set of related objects that conform to a pre-defined
schema and share user-level access permissions. Realms may contain more
than one type of data as long as a schema exists for each type.

A {+realm+} allows you to partition data according to who
uses it and when they use it. Every {+realm+} stores data in
a separate :term:`{+realm+} file` that contains a binary
encoding of each object in the {+realm+}. You can
automatically :doc:`synchronize {+realm+} across multiple
devices </sync>` and set up :ref:`reactive
event handlers <android-realm-notifications>` that call a
function any time an object in a {+realm+} is created,
modified, or deleted.

.. _android-realm-types:

Types of Realm
--------------

When opening a {+realm+}, you can configure many properties of the {+realm+}.

.. _android-read-only-realms-fundamentals:

Read-Only Realms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's sometimes useful to ship a prepared {+realm+} file with your app
that contains shared data that does not frequently change. You can use
the :java-sdk:`readOnly() <io/realm/RealmConfiguration.Builder.html#readOnly-->`
method when configuring your {+realm+} to make it read-only. This can
prevent accidental writes to the {+realm+} and causes the {+realm+} to
throw an ``IllegalStateException`` if a write occurs.

.. warning:: Read-Only Realm Files are Writeable

   Read-only {+realm+}s are only enforced as read-only in process; the
   {+realm+} file itself is still writeable. As a result, it is still
   possible for other process to write to a read-only {+realm+}.

   :ref:`Usage Examples: Read-Only Realms <android-read-only-realms>`

.. _android-in-memory-realms-fundamentals:

In-Memory Realms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a {+realm+} that runs entirely in memory without being written
to a file, use the :java-sdk:`inMemory()` method when configuring your
{+realm+}.

.. important:: In-Memory Realms May Persist to Disk Under High Memory Pressure

   When memory runs low on an Android device, in-memory {+realm+}s
   may :wikipedia:`swap <Memory_paging#Terminology>` temporarily from main
   memory to disk space. However, all files created by an in-memory
   {+realm+} are deleted when that {+realm+} closes or all references
   to that {+realm+} fall out of scope.

   :ref:`Usage Examples: In-Memory Realms <android-in-memory-realms>`

.. _android-dynamic-realms-fundamentals:

Dynamic Realms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Conventional {+realm+}s define a schema using ``RealmObject`` subclasses
or the ``RealmModel`` interface. A
:java-sdk:`DynamicRealm <io/realm/DynamicRealm.html>` uses strings to
define a schema at runtime. Opening a dynamic {+realm+} uses the same
configuration as a conventional {+realm+}, but dynamic {+realm+}s ignore
all configured schema, migration, and schema versions.

.. important:: Dynamic Realms Lack Type-Safety

   Dynamic {+realm+}s offer flexibility at the expense of type safety and
   performance. As a result, only use dynamic {+realm+}s when that
   flexibility is required, such as during migrations, manual client
   resets, and when working with string-based data like CSV files or JSON.

.. _android-realm-lifecycle:

The Realm Lifecycle
-------------------

Every {+realm+} instance consumes a significant amount of resources.
Opening and closing a {+realm+} are both expensive operations, but
keeping a {+realm+} open also incurs significant resource overhead. To
maximize the performance of your application, you should minimize the
number of open {+realm+}s at any given time and limit the number of
open and close operations used.

As a best practice, we recommend tying the {+realm+} instance
lifecycle to the lifecycles of the views that observe the {+realm+}. For
instance, consider a ``RecyclerView`` that displays ``RealmResults``
data via a ``Fragment``. You could:

- Open a single {+realm+} that contains the data for that view
  in the ``Fragment.onCreateView()`` lifecycle method.
- Close that same {+realm+} in the ``Fragment.onDestroyView()``
  lifecycle method.

.. note::

   If your {+realm+} is especially large, fetching a {+realm+} instance
   in ``Fragment.onCreateView()`` may briefly block rendering. If
   opening your {+realm+} in ``onCreateView()`` causes performance
   issues, consider managing the {+realm+} from ``Fragment.onStart()``
   and ``Fragment.onStop()`` instead.

If multiple ``Fragment`` instances require access to the same dataset,
you could manage a single {+realm+} in the enclosing ``Activity``:

- Open the {+realm+} in the ``Activity.onCreate()`` lifecycle method.
- Close the {+realm+} in the ``Activity.onDestroy()`` lifecycle method.

Multi-process
-------------

You cannot access :ref:`encrypted <android-encrypt-a-realm>` or
:ref:`synced <android-sync-changes-between-devices>` {+realm+}s
simultaneously from different processes. However, local {+realm+}s
function normally across processes, so you can read, write, and
receive notifications from multiple APKs.

Comparison with Other Databases
-------------------------------

The {+service+} data model is similar to both relational and document
databases but has distinct differences from both. To underscore these
differences, it's helpful to highlight what a {+realm+} **is not**:

A {+realm+} is not a single, application-wide database.
    Unlike other applications, which store all of their data in a single
    database, {+app+}s often split data across multiple {+realms+} to
    organize data more efficiently and to enforce access controls.

A {+realm+} is not a table.
    Tables typically only store one kind of information, such as street
    addresses or items in a store inventory, whereas a {+realm+} can contain
    any number of object types.

A {+realm+} is not a collection of schemaless documents.
    Application objects are similar to documents, but every object in a
    {+realm+} conforms to a defined schema for its object type. An object
    cannot contain a field that is not described by its schema.

.. _android-realm-schema:

Realm Schema
------------

A **{+backend-schema+}** is a list of valid :ref:`object schemas
<android-realm-objects>` that each define an object type that a {+app+}
may persist. All objects in a {+realm+} must conform to the {+backend-schema+}.

Client applications provide a {+frontend-schema+} when they open a
{+realm+}. If a {+realm+} already contains data, then {+client-database+}
validates each existing object to ensure that an object schema was
provided for its type and that it meets all of the constraints specified
in the schema.

.. example::
   
   A {+realm+} that contains basic data about books in libraries might use a
   schema like the following:
   
   .. code-block:: json
      
      [
        {
          "type": "Library",
          "properties": {
            "address": "string",
            "books": "Book[]"
          }
        },
        {
          "type": "Book",
          "primaryKey": "isbn",
          "properties": {
            "isbn": "string",
            "title": "string",
            "author": "string",
            "numberOwned": { "type": "int?", "default": 0 },
            "numberLoaned": { "type": "int?", "default": 0 }
          }
        }
      ]

.. _android-realm-path:

Synced Realms are Partitions of Atlas Data
------------------------------------------

Each {+realm+} corresponds to a subset of the data in your
:term:`{+app+}'s <{+app+}>`
:term:`synced {+atlas+} cluster <synced cluster>`. You can customize the
:ref:`partitioning <partitioning>` of data using your application's
:ref:`partition key <partition-keys>`. Unique values of the partition
key, known as :term:`partition values <partition value>`, correspond to
individual {+realms+}.

You can customize permissions for these partitions of data using
:ref:`{+service-short+} Rules <sync-rules>`.


Summary
-------

- A :term:`{+realm+}` is a collection of objects that conform to a
  schema. It is not a single, application-wide database. There can and
  usually will be more than one {+realm+} per application.

- A :term:`{+backend-schema+}` is a versioned specification of the
  object types used in a {+app+}.

- {+service-short+} Rules define who can read or write
  the {+realm+} and apply to the {+realm+} as a whole.

- A :term:`partition value` is a {+realm+}'s unique identifier.

- Modules let you selectively include subsets of the Realm objects defined
  in your application schema when opening a {+realm+}.

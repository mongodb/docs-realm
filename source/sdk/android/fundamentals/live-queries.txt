Objects in {+service-short+} clients are **live objects** that
update automatically to reflect data changes, including
:doc:`synced </sync>` remote changes, and emit
:ref:`notification events <android-client-notifications>` that you
can subscribe to whenever their underlying data changes. You
can use live objects to work with object-oriented data
natively without an :wikipedia:`ORM
<Object-relational_mapping>` tool.

Live objects are direct proxies to the underlying stored data, which
means that a live object doesn't directly contain data. Instead, a live
object always references the most up-to-date data on disk and
:wikipedia:`lazy loads <Lazy_loading>` field values when you access
them from a :ref:`collection <android-client-collections>`. This means that a
{+realm+} can contain many objects but only pays the performance cost for
data that the application is actually using.

Valid write operations on a live object automatically persist to the
{+realm+} and propagate to any other synced clients. You do not need to
call an update method, modify the {+realm+}, or otherwise "push" updates.

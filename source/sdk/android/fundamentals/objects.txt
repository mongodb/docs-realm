Realm Objects - Android SDK
===========================

Overview
--------

{+service+} applications model data as objects composed of field-value pairs
that each contain one or more primitive data types or other {+service-short+}
objects. :term:`{+service-short+} objects <Realm object>` are essentially the same
as regular objects, but they also include
additional features like
:ref:`real-time updating data views <android-live-object>` and reactive
:ref:`change event handlers <android-client-notifications>`.

Every {+service-short+} object has an *object type* that refers to the object's
class. Objects of the same type share an :ref:`object schema
<android-object-schema>` that defines the fields and relationships of those
objects. You can define your own object schemas using Kotlin and
Java class declarations.

Example
-------

.. example::

   The following code block shows an object schema that describes a Dog.
   Every Dog object must include a ``name`` and ``age`` and may
   optionally include the dog's ``breed`` and a reference to a Person
   object that represents the dog's ``owner``.

Summary
-------

- {+service-short+} objects are of a **type** defined as you would any other
  class.

- {+service-short+} objects are **live**: they always reflect the latest version
  on disk and update automatically when the underlying object changes.

- The {+service-short+} object's **schema** defines the fields of the object and
  which fields are optional, which fields have a default value,
  and which fields are indexed.

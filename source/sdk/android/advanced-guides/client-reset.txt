When using :doc:`{+sync+} </sync>`, a **client
reset** is a serious error recovery task that your client
app must perform in the following situation:

- The given synced {+realm+} on the server was restored from a backup.
  For example, due to a {+service-short+} server crash.

- The client app made changes to that {+realm+} since the backup was made,
  but did not sync those changes back to the server before the server
  was restored.

In other words, the client app must carry out a client reset
on a given synced {+realm+} if the server is restored to a
version older than the version on the client.

A client reset erases all local data and downloads a new copy of the
data stored in MongoDB Atlas. Performing a client reset loses all local
changes made since the client last successfully synced.

Example
-------

By default, the SDK performs client resets automatically on startup when
instructed to do so by the server. When a client
reset occurs, the SDK creates a backup of local data. By default,
the SDK makes no effort to recover lost local changes from this backup.
If you override the client reset handler, you can access this backup
copy through the
:java-sdk:`SyncConfiguration <io/realm/mongodb/sync/SyncConfiguration.html>`
stored in the
:java-sdk:`ClientResetRequiredError <io/realm/mongodb/sync/ClientResetRequiredError.html>`
to manually transfer data from the backup copy to the newly created {+realm+}.

To override the default client reset behavior, create an instance of a
:java-sdk:`SyncSession.ClientResetHandler <io/realm/mongodb/sync/SyncSession.ClientResetHandler.html>`
that overrides the default
:java-sdk:`onClientReset() <io/realm/mongodb/sync/SyncSession.ClientResetHandler.html#onClientReset-io.realm.mongodb.sync.SyncSession-io.realm.mongodb.sync.ClientResetRequiredError->`
behavior. Pass this object to your
:java-sdk:`SyncConfiguration.Builder <io/realm/mongodb/sync/SyncConfiguration.Builder.html>`
(for clients that use {+sync+}) using the :java-sdk:`defaultClientResetHandler() <io/realm/mongodb/sync/SyncConfiguration.Builder.html#clientResetHandler-io.realm.mongodb.sync.SyncSession.ClientResetHandler->`
builder method:

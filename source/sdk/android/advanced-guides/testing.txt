Unit Testing
------------

When unit testing {+service-short+} applications, it's best to mock
{+client-database+}.

.. seealso::

   See the `Unit Testing Example App
   <https://github.com/realm/realm-java/tree/master/examples/unitTestExample>`__
   for an example of how {+service-short+} can be combined with JUnit3,
   JUnit4, Robolectric, Mockito and PowerMock.

Integration Testing
-------------------

Integration testing for {+service-short+} applications faces one major
challenge: the {+client-database+} interface (both local and {+sync+})
requires an Android application context to access data stored on disk.
Create an application context, such as a test activity, in your
application so you can access the database.

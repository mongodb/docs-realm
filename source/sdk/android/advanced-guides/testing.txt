   See the `Unit Testing Example App
   <https://github.com/realm/realm-java/tree/master/examples/unitTestExample>`__
   for information on how {+service-short+} can be combined with JUnit3,
   JUnit4, Robolectric, Mockito and PowerMock.

Android Studio Debugging
------------------------

.. warning::
   
   The Android Studio debugger can provide misleading values for
   {+service-short+} object fields. For correct values, you can watch
   accessor values instead, or use the {+service-short+} object
   ``toString()`` method to see the latest field values.

This guide details information you should keep in mind when debugging
{+service-short+} applications with Android Studio to avoid incorrect
value reporting. For example, adding a watch in Android Studio on a
{+service-short+} object displays values of the fields. These values 
are wrong because the field values are not used.
{+service-short+} creates a proxy object behind the scenes and overrides
the getters and setters in order to access the persisted data in the
{+realm+}. Adding a watch for any of the accessors will yield the
correct values. See the image below:

.. figure:: /images/android-studio-debugging.png
   :alt: When using the Android Studio debugger, accessors display the correct field value, while fields show outdated information.

In the image above, the debugger has stopped on line ``113``. There are
three watch values:

- the ``person`` variable
- the ``person.getName()`` accessor
- the ``person.getAge()`` accessor

The code from lines ``107`` to ``111`` alters the ``person`` instance by
changing the name and age in a write transaction. On line ``113``, the ``person`` watch instance reports
incorrect values for the *field* watch values. The watch values that use
the *accessors* report values that are correct.

NDK Debugging
-------------

The {+service-short+} Android SDK library contains native code. 
Debugging NDK crashes can be cumbersome as the default stack trace
provides minimal information. 

We recommend you use a crash reporting tool such as
`Crashlytics <http://www.crashlytics.com/>`__ to track native errors
and gather other valuable information so we are in a better position 
to help you if something goes wrong.

To enable NDK crash reporting in Crashlytics for
your project, add the following to the root of your application
``build.gradle`` file:

.. code-block:: groovy

   crashlytics {
      enableNdk true
   }

.. note::

   The values ``androidNdkOut`` and ``androidNdkLibsOut`` are not needed.

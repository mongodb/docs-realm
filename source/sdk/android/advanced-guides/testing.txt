You can test your Android {+service-short+} applications in two ways:

- **Unit Testing**, which individually tests small facets of your
  application, such as a single function. Unit testing notably never
  sends data over the network and typically uses
  :wiki:`mocking <Mock_object>` to replace network connectivity with
  expected behavior.

- **Integration Testing**, which tests entire workflows and sections
  of your codebase and sometimes involves network requests.

Unit Testing
------------

- Mockito for mocking
- mock everything realm does
- example gradle imports and test?
- no link to your backend or a local Realm Database, so everything
  must be mocked clientside,
  from function logic to auth logic to partition/sync logic


Integration Testing
-------------------

When integration testing {+service-short+}, you should be aware of a few
limitations:

- Realm relies on a :ref:`Looper </reference/android/os/Looper>` message
  loop in threads that communicate with your database.

- Realm cannot run in a testing thread
- need to run logic in a looper thread, so running on the ui thread of
  a testing device lets you hit your backend
- certain functions cannot be run synchronously in the ui thread, so
  you'll either have to use the async version on the ui thread (and
  find a way to block while you wait for the async result, similar to
  promises in JS) or create a custom looper thread to test your logic.
  you should choose the approach that best reflects the logic you use
  in your application (async ui thread requests or sync background
  looper thread requests?)

Couldn't load "librealm-jni.so"
-------------------------------

If your app uses native libraries that don’t ship with support for
64-bit architectures, Android will fail to load Realm’s
``librealm-jni.so`` file on ARM64 devices. This happens because Android
cannot load 32-bit and 64-bit native libraries concurrently. Ideally,
all libraries could provide the same set of supported ABIs, but
sometimes that may not be doable when using a 3rd-party library.

To work around this issue, you can exclude Realm’s ARM64 library from
the APK file by adding the following code to the application’s
``build.gradle``. You can refer to Mixing 32- and 64-bit Dependencies in Android for more information.

.. code-block:: gradle

   android {
       //...
       packagingOptions {
           exclude "lib/arm64-v8a/librealm-jni.so"
       }
       //...
   }

Network Calls to Mixpanel
-------------------------

{+service-short+} collects anonymous analytics when you run the
{+service-short+} bytecode transformer on your source code. This is
completely anonymous and helps us improve the product by flagging:

- which version of the SDK you use
- which operating system you use
- if your application uses Kotlin
- if your application uses local-only {+client-database+} or {+sync+}

Analytics do not run when your application runs on user devices - only
when you compile your source code. To opt out of analytics, you can set
the ``REALM_DISABLE_ANALYTICS`` environment variable to ``true``.

Change Listeners in Android 12 with SDK Versions Below 10.6.0
-------------------------------------------------------------

Due to an update to the Linux kernel in Android 12,
:ref:`object, collection, and {+realm+} notifications
<android-client-notifications>` do not work in SDK versions below
10.6.0 on Android 12. For full functionality in Android 12, update
to SDK version 10.6.0.

=======================

The Realm C++ SDK enables client applications written in C++ to access data
stored in realms and sync data with Atlas. This page details how to 
install Realm in your project and get started.

Requirements
------------

- Minimum C++ standard: C++17.
- For development on macOS: Xcode 11.x or later.
- Otherwise, we recommend git and `CMake <https://cmake.org>`_.

Install
-------

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: SwiftPM
      :tabid: swiftpm

      When developing with Xcode, you can use Swift Package Manager (SPM) to
      install realm-cpp.

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Add Package Dependency

            In Xcode, select ``File`` > ``Add Packages...``.

         .. step:: Specify the Repository

            Copy and paste the following into the search/input box.

            .. code-block:: sh

               https://github.com/realm/realm-cpp

         .. step:: Select the Package Products

            Under :guilabel:`Package Product`, select ``realm-cpp-sdk``. Under
            :guilabel:`Add to Target`, select the target you would like to add
            Realm to. For example, the target might be the main executable of
            your app. Click :guilabel:`Add Package`.

   .. tab:: CMake
      :tabid: cmake

      You can use CMake with the FetchContent module to manage Realm and its
      dependencies in your C++ project.

      Create or modify your ``CMakeLists.txt`` in the root directory of your 
      project:

      1. Add ``Include(FetchContent)`` to include the FetchContent module 
         in your project build.
      #. Use ``FetchContent_Declare`` to locate the Realm dependency 
         and specify the commit hash you want to use. 
      #. Use the ``FetchContent_MakeAvailable()`` command to check whether 
         the named dependencies have been populated, and if not, populate them. 
      #. Finally, ``target_link_libraries()`` links the Realm dependency to 
         your target executable. 
      
      To get the most recent commit hash, go to GitHub 
      `realm/realm-cpp@main <https://github.com/realm/realm-cpp/commit/main>`__.
      
      You can also view the commit hash that built the :cpp-sdk:`C++ API reference 
      documentation <>` at the top of the page next to the SDK name. For example:
      ``Pre-alpha version main@ee900c16b9e02b85da599cc5a3eced50b7a89e0f``.

      Set the minimum C++ standard to 17 with ``set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)``.

      .. code-block:: cmake
         :emphasize-lines: 9, 13-17, 20, 25

         cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.15)

         project(MyRealmCppProject)

         # Minimum C++ standard
         set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)

         # Include the FetchContent module so you can download the Realm C++ SDK
         Include(FetchContent)

         # Declare the version of the Realm C++ SDk you want to download
         # While it's in alpha, use a git commit hash instead of a tagged release
         FetchContent_Declare(
           cpprealm
           GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/realm/realm-cpp.git
           GIT_TAG        f4f89d1c75d4c762a679f57d2e9f26e87ec1215b
         )

         # The MakeAvailable command ensures the named dependencies have been populated
         FetchContent_MakeAvailable(cpprealm)

         # Create an executable target called myApp with the source file main.cpp
         add_executable(myApp main.cpp)

         target_link_libraries(myApp PRIVATE cpprealm)

      Run CMake in a gitignored directory, such as ``build``, to generate the build
      configurations that you can then use to compile your app:

      .. code-block:: bash

         # build/ is in .gitignore
         mkdir build
         cd build
         cmake .. # Create Makefile by reading the CMakeLists.txt in the parent directory (../)
         make # Actually build the app

      You can use CMake to generate more than simple Makefiles by using the ``-G``
      flag. See the `CMake documentation <https://cmake.org/documentation/>`_ for more
      information.

Usage
-----

Include the Header
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make the Realm C++ SDK available in your code by including the
``cpprealm/sdk.hpp`` header in the translation unit where you want to use it:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/examples.snippet.includes.cpp
   :language: cpp

.. _cpp-build-android-app:

Build an Android App
--------------------

The Realm C++ SDK Alpha supports building Android apps. To build an Android
app:

- Add ``<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />`` to your ``AndroidManifest.xml``
- Add the subdirectory of the Realm C++ SDK to your native library's ``CMakeLists.txt``
  and link it as a target library:

  .. code-block:: text

     set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17) 
     add_subdirectory("realm-cpp")
     ...
     target_link_libraries( 
        # Specifies the target library.
        myapplication
        # make sure to link the Realm C++ SDK.
        cpprealm
     )

- Ensure that the git submodules are initialized inside of the ``realm-cpp`` folder before building. 
- When instantiating the Realm or the Realm App, you must pass the ``filesDir.path`` as the ``path`` 
  parameter in the respective constructor or realm open template. 

For an example of how to use the Realm C++ SDK Alpha in an Android app, refer to
the :github:`Android RealmExample App <realm/realm-cpp/tree/main/examples/Android>`
in the ``realm-cpp`` GitHub repository.

Specifically, refer to the ``MainActivity.kt`` & ``native-lib.cpp`` files 
in the Android example app for code examples.

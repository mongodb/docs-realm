When you enable the :ref:`email/password provider <email-password-authentication>` 
in your Atlas App Services App, you can handle user authentication from client code
by registering a new user account.

.. TODO: Note that "User objects can be accessed from any thread."

.. _cpp-register-a-new-user-account:

Register a New User Account
---------------------------

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/authentication.snippet.register-user.cpp
   :language: cpp

Confirm registration with an email
----------------------------------

You can use Atlas App Services to :ref:`send a confirmation email <auth-run-a-confirmation-function>` 
to newly-registered user account email addresses. After confirmation, you can log
the user in.

Log a Registered User in or out
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. TODO: fill this section out

Users must be registered before you can log them in or out.

To log a user in:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/authentication.snippet.log-user-in.cpp
   :language: cpp

To log a user out:
.. realm::User.log_out()

Handle password resets with an Atlas Function
---------------------------------------------

To reset a user password, you can :ref:`run a password reset function 
<auth-run-a-password-reset-function>`. To do so, you need to properly configure
your Atlas App Services App.

1. In the Atlas UI, go to your App
#. Select :guilabel:`Authentication`, then select the :guilabel:`Authentication Providers` tab
#. In the :guilabel:`Email/Password` row, press the :guilabel:`EDIT` button
#. Under :guilabel:`User Confirmation`, select :guilabel:`Run a confirmation function`
#. Select your confirmation function or create a new function, then press :guilabel:`Save`

Now, you can use the custom password reset function you created in your client code.

.. TODO: Figure out how to demenstrate call a function through the user object.

Realm applications model data as objects composed of
field-value pairs that each contain one or more :ref:`supported
<cpp-supported-property-types>` data types.

.. _cpp-realm-objects:

Object Types and Schemas
------------------------

Every Realm object has an *object type* that refers to the object's
class. Objects of the same type share an :ref:`object schema
<cpp-object-schema>` that defines the properties and relationships of those
objects.

.. _cpp-realm-schema:

Realm Schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **realm schema** is a list of valid object schemas that a realm may 
contain. Every Realm object must conform to an object type that's included 
in its realm's schema.

When opening a realm, you must specify which models are available by 
passing the models to the template you use to open the realm. Those 
models must have schemas, and this list of schemas becomes the realm schema.

If a realm already contains data when you open it, Realm 
validates each object to ensure that an object schema was provided for 
its type and that it meets all of the constraints specified in the schema.

For more information about how to open a realm, refer to: :ref:`cpp-configure-and-open-a-realm`

.. _cpp-object-model:
.. _cpp-properties:

Realm Object Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your Realm object model is the core structure that gives Realm 
information about how to interpret and store the objects in your app.
The C++ Realm object model is a class or a struct that subclasses one of 
the Realm object types. The object model contains a collection of 
properties. You annotate the properties in the model to give Realm 
information about each property:

- The data type and whether the property is optional or required
- Additional metadata about a property, such as whether it's a primary key

Properties are also the mechanism for establishing :ref:`relationships 
<cpp-relationships>` between Realm object types.

You use this object model like any other C++ class or struct when you
initialize your objects. 

In addition to property information, each C++ Realm object model must 
expose a schema. 

.. _cpp-object-schema:

Realm Object Schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Current
      :tabid: current

      A Realm C++ SDK **realm object schema** maps property names for a 
      specific object type. A schema must accompany your object model, and 
      it may be one of:

      - ``REALM_SCHEMA``
      - ``REALM_EMBEDDED_SCHEMA``
      - ``REALM_ASYMMETRIC_SCHEMA``

      The schema, combined with your object model, gives the C++ SDK the 
      information it needs to store and retrieve objects.

   .. tab:: Deprecated
      :tabid: deprecated

      A Realm C++ SDK **realm object schema** maps property names, 
      relationships, and any property metadata for a specific object type. 
      Because C++ does not have reflection, your model must expose a public 
      static **constexpr** member that explicitly declares your schema. 
      The object schema includes details like the property name and type, 
      whether the property is a primary key, and whether it forms a 
      relationship with other object types.

.. _cpp-define-a-new-object-type:

Define a New Object Type
------------------------

      :tabid: current

      In the C++ SDK Preview, you can define your models or classes as regular 
      C++ structs. Using the ``realm::experimental`` namespace, provide a
      :ref:`cpp-object-schema` with the struct name and the names of any 
      properties that you want Realm to persist. When you add the object 
      to a realm, the SDK ignores any properties that you omit from the schema.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/crud.snippet.beta-realm-define-model.cpp
         :language: cpp

      .. include:: /includes/tip-cpp-beta-experimental-features.rst

   .. tab:: Deprecated
      :tabid: deprecated

      You can define your models as classes or structs that inherit from 
      :cpp-sdk:`realm::object <structrealm_1_1object.html>`. The Realm C++ SDK
      uses `CRTP <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/crtp>`__ to simplify
      working with Realm objects. With this implementation, you pass the object's
      type as a template paramater when you declare your object struct.

      You must declare any property you want to store (persist) in a realm as 
      :cpp-sdk:`realm::persisted <structrealm_1_1persisted.html>`. Your model 
      must also expose a public static constant expression (``constexpr``) member 
      called ``schema``. Use the :cpp-sdk:`realm::schema 
      <structrealm_1_1schemagen_1_1schema.html>` and :cpp-sdk:`realm::property 
      <structrealm_1_1schemagen_1_1property.html>` templates to describe your schema.

      Realm ignores any members not declared as ``realm::persisted`` and not 
      declared in the schema.

         :language: cpp

.. include:: /includes/note-class-char-limit.rst

.. _cpp-primary-key:

Specify a Primary Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can designate a property as the **primary key** of your object.

Primary keys allow you to efficiently find, update, and upsert objects.

Primary keys are subject to the following limitations:

- You can define only one primary key per object model.

- Primary key values must be unique across all instances of an object
  in a realm. Realm throws an error if you try to
  insert a duplicate primary key value.

- Primary key values are immutable. To change the primary key value of
  an object, you must delete the original object and insert a new object
  with a different primary key value.

- Embedded objects cannot define a primary key.

If you are using :ref:`Device Sync <cpp-synced-realm>`, your models must 
have a primary key named ``_id``.

The Realm C++ SDK supports primary keys of the following types, and their 
optional variants:

- ``int64_t``
- ``realm::object_id``
- ``realm::uuid``
- ``std::string``

Additionally, a required ``realm::enum`` property can be a primary key, but
``realm::enum`` cannot be optional if it is used as a primary key.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Current
      :tabid: current

      Set a property as a primary key with the ``primary_key`` template:

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/crud.snippet.beta-person-model.cpp
         :language: cpp
         :emphasize-lines: 2

      .. include:: /includes/tip-cpp-beta-experimental-features.rst

   .. tab:: Deprecated
      :tabid: deprecated

      Set a property as a primary key by passing ``true`` to the second 
      template parameter of the ``persisted`` template:

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/crud.snippet.define-a-schema.cpp
         :language: cpp
         :emphasize-lines: 2

.. _cpp-ignore-property:

Ignore a Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your model may include properties that Realm does not store.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Current
      :tabid: current

      Realm ignores any properties not included in the :ref:`cpp-object-schema`.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/crud.snippet.beta-employee-model.cpp
         :language: cpp
         :emphasize-lines: 8

      .. include:: /includes/tip-cpp-beta-experimental-features.rst

   .. tab:: Deprecated
      :tabid: deprecated

      Realm ignores any members not declared as ``realm::persisted`` and not declared 
      in the schema.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/define-object-model.snippet.model-with-ignored-field.cpp
         :language: cpp
         :emphasize-lines: 7

.. _cpp-embedded-object:

Define an Embedded Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An **embedded object** is a special type of object that models complex 
data about a specific object. Embedded objects are similar to 
relationships, but they provide additional constraints and
map more naturally to the denormalized :manual:`MongoDB document model
</core/data-modeling-introduction/>`.

Realm enforces unique ownership constraints that treat each embedded
object as nested data inside of a single, specific parent object. An
embedded object inherits the lifecycle of its parent object and cannot
exist as an independent Realm object. Realm automatically deletes
embedded objects if their parent object is deleted or when overwritten
by a new embedded object instance.

You can declare an object as an :ref:`embedded object <cpp-embedded-object>` 
that does not have a lifecycle independent of the object in which it 
is embedded. This differs from a :ref:`to-one <cpp-to-one-relationship>` 
or :ref:`to-many <cpp-to-many-relationship>` relationship, in which the 
related objects have independent lifecycles.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Current
      :tabid: current

      Using the ``realm::experimental`` namespace, provide a
      ``REALM_EMBEDDED_SCHEMA`` with the struct name and the names of 
      any properties that you want Realm to persist.
      
      Define a property as an embedded object on the parent object by setting 
      a pointer to the embedded object's type.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/crud.snippet.beta-model-with-embedded-object.cpp

      .. include:: /includes/tip-cpp-beta-experimental-features.rst

   .. tab:: Deprecated
      :tabid: deprecated

      To declare an object as an embedded object, inherit from 
      :cpp-sdk:`realm::embedded_object <structrealm_1_1embedded__object.html>`.

      .. include:: /examples/generated/cpp/define-object-model.snippet.model-with-embedded-object.cpp.rst

.. _cpp-define-asymmetric-object:

Define an Asymmetric Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use :ref:`Data Ingest <optimize-data-ingest>` to sync an 
object unidirectionally from your device to the database linked to your 
Atlas App Services App.

An ``asymmetric_object`` broadly has the same :ref:`supported types 
<cpp-supported-property-types>` as ``realm::object``, with a few exceptions:

- Asymmetric objects can only link to embedded objects
   - ``object`` and ``std::vector<object>`` properties are not supported 
   - ``embedded_object`` and ``std::vector<embedded_object>`` *are* supported

You cannot link to an ``asymmetric_object`` from within an ``object``. Doing so 
throws an error.

Asymmetric objects do not function in the same way as other Realm objects. 
You cannot:

- Remove an asymmetric object from a realm
- Query an asymmetric object

You can only create an asymmetric object, which then syncs unidirectionally 
to the Atlas database linked to your App with Device Sync.

For more information, see: :ref:`Create an Asymmetric Object 
<cpp-create-asymmetric-object>`.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Current
      :tabid: current

      In the C++ SDK Preview, define an asymmetric object the same way you would 
      a regular C++ struct. Using the ``realm::experimental`` namespace, 
      provide a ``REALM_ASYMMETRIC_SCHEMA`` with the struct name and the 
      names of any properties that you want Realm to persist.

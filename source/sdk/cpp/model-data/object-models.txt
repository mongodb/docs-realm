Key Concept: Object Types & Schemas
-----------------------------------

Realm Database applications model data as objects composed of
field-value pairs that each contain one or more :ref:`supported
<cpp-supported-property-types>` data types.

Every Realm object has an *object type* that refers to the object's
class. Objects of the same type share an :ref:`object schema
<cpp-object-schema>` that defines the properties and relationships of those
objects.

.. _cpp-realm-schema:

Realm Schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **realm schema** is a list of valid object schemas that a realm may 
contain. Every Realm object must conform to an object type that's included 
in its realm's schema.

When opening a realm, you must specify which models are available by 
passing the models to the template you use to open the realm. Those 
models must have schemas, and this list of schemas becomes the realm schema.

If a realm already contains data when you open it, Realm Database 
validates each object to ensure that an object schema was provided for 
its type and that it meets all of the constraints specified in the schema.

For more information about how to open a realm, refer to: :ref:`cpp-configure-and-open-a-realm`

.. _cpp-object-model:
.. _cpp-properties:

Realm Object Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your Realm object model is the core structure that gives Realm 
information about how to interpret and store the objects in your app.
The C++ Realm object model is a class or a struct that subclasses one of 
the Realm object types. The object model contains a collection of 
properties. You annotate the properties in the model to give Realm 
information about each property:

- The data type and whether the property is optional or required
- Whether Realm should store or ignore the property

Properties are also the mechanism for establishing :ref:`relationships 
<cpp-relationships>` between Realm object types.

You use this object model like any other C++ class or struct when you
initialize your objects. 

In addition to property information, each C++ Realm object model must 
expose a schema. 

.. _cpp-object-schema:

Realm Object Schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A C++ **realm object schema** maps property names, relationships, and any 
property metadata for a specific object type. Because C++ does not have 
reflection, your model must expose a public static **constexpr** 
member that explicitly declares your schema. The object schema includes 
details like the property name and type, whether the property is a primary 
key, and whether it forms a relationship with other object types.

.. _cpp-define-a-new-object-type:

Define a New Object Type
------------------------

You can define your models as classes or structs that inherit from 
:cpp-sdk:`realm::object <structrealm_1_1object.html>`. The Realm C++ SDK
uses `CRTP <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/crtp>`__ to simplify
working with Realm objects. With this implementation, you pass the object's
type as a template paramater when you declare your object struct.

You must declare any property you want to store (persist) in a realm as 
:cpp-sdk:`realm::persisted <structrealm_1_1persisted.html>`. Your model 
must also expose a public static constant expression (``constexpr``) member 
called ``schema``. Use the :cpp-sdk:`realm::schema 
<structrealm_1_1internal_1_1schema.html>` and :cpp-sdk:`realm::property 
<structrealm_1_1property.html>` templates to describe your schema.

Realm ignores any members not declared as ``realm::persisted`` and not 
declared in the schema.

   :language: cpp

.. _cpp-primary-key:

Specify a Primary Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can designate a property as the **primary key** of your object.

Primary keys allow you to efficiently find, update, and upsert objects.

Primary keys are subject to the following limitations:

- You can define only one primary key per object model.

- Primary key values must be unique across all instances of an object
  in a realm. Realm Database throws an error if you try to
  insert a duplicate primary key value.

- Primary key values are immutable. To change the primary key value of
  an object, you must delete the original object and insert a new object
  with a different primary key value.

- Embedded objects cannot define a primary key.

If you are using :ref:`Device Sync <cpp-synced-realm>`, your models must 
have a primary key named ``_id``.

The Realm C++ SDK supports primary keys of the following types, required or optional:

- ``realm::object_id``
- ``realm::uuid``
- ``realm::enum``
- ``std::string``

You set a property as a primary key by passing ``true`` to the second template parameter of the ``persisted`` template:

.. _cpp-ignore-property:

Ignore a Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your model may include properties that Realm Database does not store. Realm 
ignores any members not declared as ``realm::persisted`` and not declared 
in the schema.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/define-object-model.snippet.model-with-ignored-field.cpp
   :language: cpp
   :emphasize-lines: 7

.. _cpp-embedded-object:

Define an Embedded Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An **embedded object** is a special type of object that models complex 
data about a specific object. Embedded objects are similar to 
relationships, but they provide additional constraints and
map more naturally to the denormalized :manual:`MongoDB document model
</core/data-modeling-introduction/>`.

Realm enforces unique ownership constraints that treat each embedded
object as nested data inside of a single, specific parent object. An
embedded object inherits the lifecycle of its parent object and cannot
exist as an independent Realm object. Realm automatically deletes
embedded objects if their parent object is deleted or when overwritten
by a new embedded object instance.

You can declare an object as an :ref:`embedded object <cpp-embedded-object>` 
that does not have a lifecycle independent of the object in which it 
is embedded. This differs from a :ref:`to-one <cpp-to-one-relationship>` 
or :ref:`to-many <cpp-to-many-relationship>` relationship, in which the 
related objects have independent lifecycles.

To declare an object as an embedded object, inherit from 
:cpp-sdk:`realm::embedded_object <structrealm_1_1embedded__object.html>`.

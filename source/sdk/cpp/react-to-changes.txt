Register an Object Change Listener
----------------------------------

You can register a notification handler on a specific object
within a realm. Realm Database notifies your handler:

- When the object is deleted.
- When any of the object's properties change.

.. code-block:: cpp
   :copyable: false
   
   auto token = object.observe([&](auto&& change) { ... }

The handler receives an :cpp-sdk:`ObjectChange <structrealm_1_1ObjectChange.html>`
object that contains information about the changes, such as whether the 
object was deleted. It may include a list 
of :cpp-sdk:`PropertyChange 
<structrealm_1_1PropertyChange.html#a71dc45a7609e6a528e70b91d20ef8f94>` 
objects that contain information about what fields changed, the new values
of those fields (except on List properties), and potentially the old values 
of the fields.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/examples.snippet.notifications-property-changes.cpp
    :language: cpp

When you make changes, :cpp-sdk:`refresh() <structrealm_1_1db.html>` the 
realm to emit a notification.

      :language: cpp

Overview
--------

You can use :ref:`Asymmetric Sync <optimize-asymmetric-sync>` to stream 
data from the client application to a Flexible Sync-enabled Atlas App Services
App.

You might want to sync data unidirectionally in IoT applications, such as
a weather sensor sending data to the cloud. Asymmetric Sync is also useful 
for writing other types of immutable data where you do not require conflict 
resolution, such as creating invoices from a retail app or logging application 
events.

Asymmetric Sync is optimized to provide performance improvements for heavy
client-side *insert-only* workloads.

Sync Data Unidirectionally from a Client Application
----------------------------------------------------

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Define an Asymmetric Object

      You can sync data unidirectionally when you inherit from 
      :cpp-sdk:`asymmetric_object <structrealm_1_1asymmetric__object.html>`.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/asymmetric-sync.snippet.asymmetric-object.cpp
         :language: cpp

      For more information on how to define an ``asymmetric_object``, including
      limitations when linking to other object types, see: 
      :ref:`Define an Asymmetric Object <cpp-define-asymmetric-object>`.

   .. step:: Connect and Authenticate with an App Services App

      To stream data from the client to your backend App, you must 
      :ref:`connect to an App Services backend <cpp-connect-to-backend>` 
      and :ref:`authenticate a user <cpp-authenticate-users>`.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/asymmetric-sync.snippet.connect-and-authenticate.cpp
         :language: cpp

   .. step:: Open a Realm

      After you have an authenticated user, you can open a synced realm
      using a ``flexibleSyncConfiguration()``. Specify the ``asymmetric_object`` 
      types you want to sync.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/asymmetric-sync.snippet.open-synced-realm-for-asymmetric-sync.cpp
         :language: cpp

      Unlike bidirectional Sync, Asymmetric Sync does not use a 
      :ref:`Flexible Sync subscription <cpp-manage-flexible-sync-subscriptions>`.

      .. tip:: Mixed Object and Asymmetric Object Types

         You cannot read, query, or delete an ``asymmetric_object`` from a
         realm, so asymmetric objects are incompatible with bi-directional
         Flexible Sync or local realm use. You cannot open a single synced
         realm to manage both regular objects and asymmetric objects - you
         must use different realms to manage these different object types.

   .. step:: Create Asymmetric Objects

      Once you have an open realm, you can create an ``asymmetric_object`` 
      and set its values as you would a regular object. However, you cannot 
      read or delete these objects. Once created, they sync to the App 
      Services backend and the linked Atlas database.

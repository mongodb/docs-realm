Sync Data Unidirectionally from a Client Application
----------------------------------------------------

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Define an Asymmetric Object

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: Current
            :tabid: current

            You can sync data unidirectionally when you declare an object's 
            schema as a ``REALM_ASYMMETRIC_SCHEMA``.

            .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/asymmetric-sync.snippet.beta-asymmetric-object.cpp
               :language: cpp

            For more information on how to define an ``REALM_ASYMMETRIC_SCHEMA``, 
            including limitations when linking to other object types, see: 
            :ref:`Define an Asymmetric Object <cpp-define-asymmetric-object>`.

            .. include:: /includes/tip-cpp-beta-experimental-features.rst

         .. tab:: Deprecated
            :tabid: deprecated

            You can sync data unidirectionally when you inherit from 
            :cpp-sdk:`asymmetric_object <structrealm_1_1asymmetric__object.html>`.

            .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/asymmetric-sync.snippet.asymmetric-object.cpp
               :language: cpp

            For more information on how to define an ``asymmetric_object``, including
            limitations when linking to other object types, see: 
            :ref:`Define an Asymmetric Object <cpp-define-asymmetric-object>`.

   .. step:: Connect and Authenticate with an App Services App

      To stream data from the client to your backend App, you must 
      :ref:`connect to an App Services backend <cpp-connect-to-backend>` 
      and :ref:`authenticate a user <cpp-authenticate-users>`.

      .. versionchanged:: 0.2.0 app.login returns std::future instead of std::promise

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/asymmetric-sync.snippet.beta-connect-and-authenticate.cpp
         :language: cpp

   .. step:: Open a Realm

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: Current
            :tabid: current

            After you have an authenticated user, you can open a synced realm
            using a ``flexibleSyncConfiguration()``. Unlike opening other 
            types of realms in the ``experimental`` namespace, when you 
            open a realm for asymmetric sync, you *must* specify the
            ``asymmetric_object`` types you want to sync.

            .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/asymmetric-sync.snippet.beta-open-asymmetric-synced-realm.cpp
               :language: cpp

            Unlike bidirectional Sync, Data Ingest does not use a 
            :ref:`Flexible Sync subscription <cpp-manage-flexible-sync-subscriptions>`.

            .. include:: /includes/tip-cpp-beta-experimental-features.rst

         .. tab:: Deprecated
            :tabid: deprecated

            After you have an authenticated user, you can open a synced realm
            using a ``flexibleSyncConfiguration()``. Specify the ``asymmetric_object`` 
            types you want to sync.

            .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/asymmetric-sync.snippet.open-synced-realm-for-asymmetric-sync.cpp
               :language: cpp

            Unlike bidirectional Sync, Data Ingest does not use a 
            :ref:`Flexible Sync subscription <cpp-manage-flexible-sync-subscriptions>`.

      .. tip:: Mixed Object and Asymmetric Object Types

         You cannot read, query, or delete an ``asymmetric_object`` from a
         realm, so asymmetric objects are incompatible with bi-directional
         Flexible Sync or local realm use. You cannot open a single synced
         realm to manage both regular objects and asymmetric objects - you
         must use different realms to manage these different object types.

   .. step:: Create Asymmetric Objects

      Once you have an open realm, you can create an ``asymmetric_object`` 
      and set its values as you would a regular object. However, you cannot 
      read or delete these objects. Once created, they sync to the App 
      Services backend and the linked Atlas database.

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: Current
            :tabid: current

            .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/asymmetric-sync.snippet.beta-create-asymmetric-object.cpp
               :language: cpp

            .. include:: /includes/tip-cpp-beta-experimental-features.rst

         .. tab:: Deprecated
            :tabid: deprecated

            .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/asymmetric-sync.snippet.create-asymmetric-object.cpp
               :language: cpp

      Atlas Device Sync completely manages the lifecycle of this data. 
      It is maintained on the device until Data Ingest synchronization is 
      complete, and then removed from the device.

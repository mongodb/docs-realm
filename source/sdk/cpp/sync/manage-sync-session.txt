When you use Atlas Device Sync, the Realm C++ SDK syncs data with Atlas
in the background using a sync session. The sync session starts when
you open a synced realm.

The sync session manages the following:

- Uploading and downloading changes to the realm
- Monitoring sync state

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you can manage a sync session state, you must:

#. :ref:`Configure Flexible Sync on the Atlas App Services backend <enable-flexible-sync>`
#. :ref:`Open a Synced Realm <cpp-open-synced-realm>`

.. _cpp-get-sync-session:

Get the Sync Session
--------------------

You can use the public member function :cpp-sdk:`get_sync_session() 
<structrealm_1_1db.html#a79c5e6e92896703a54693be35720ae12>` to get a 
:cpp-sdk:`sync_session 
<structrealm_1_1internal_1_1bridge_1_1sync__session.html>` 
object for any synced realm. The SDK returns this object as an optional. 
It is a lightweight handle that you can pass around by value.

.. _cpp-sync-wait-for-changes:

Wait for Changes to Upload and Download
---------------------------------------

To wait for all changes to upload to Atlas from your synced realm,
use the public member function ``.wait_for_upload_completion()``. 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/quick-start.snippet.wait-for-upload.cpp
   :language: cpp

To wait for all changes from Atlas
to download to your synced realm, use the public member function 
``wait_for_download_completion()``. Refresh the realm after downloading 
any changes to be sure it reflects the most recent data.

   :language: cpp

.. _cpp-check-sync-state:

Check the Sync State
--------------------

You can use the :cpp-sdk:`sync_session 
<structrealm_1_1internal_1_1bridge_1_1sync__session.html>`'s public 
member function ``state()`` to check whether the sync session is active.
This returns an enum whose value reflects possible Device Sync states.

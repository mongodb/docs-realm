Key Concept: Transactions
-------------------------

Write Transactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Realm Database uses a highly efficient storage engine
to persist objects. You can **create** objects in a realm,
**update** objects in a realm, and eventually **delete**
objects from a realm. Because these operations modify the
state of the realm, we call them writes.

Realm handles writes in terms of **transactions**. A
transaction is a list of read and write operations that
Realm treats as a single indivisible operation. In other
words, a transaction is *all or nothing*: either all of the
operations in the transaction succeed or none of the
operations in the transaction take effect. 

All writes must happen in a transaction.

A realm allows only one open transaction at a time. Realm
blocks other writes on other threads until the open
transaction is complete. Consequently, there is no race
condition when reading values from the realm within a
transaction.

When you are done with your transaction, Realm either
**commits** it or **cancels** it:

- When Realm **commits** a transaction, Realm writes
  all changes to disk. For synced realms, the SDK queues the change
  for synchronization with Atlas Device Sync.
- When Realm **cancels** a write transaction or an operation in
  the transaction causes an error, all changes are discarded
  (or "rolled back").

Create a New Object
-------------------

.. _cpp-create-a-new-object:

Create an Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add an object to a realm, instantiate it as you would any other
object. Then pass it to the :cpp-sdk:`Realm.add() function
<structrealm_1_1db.html>` inside of a write transaction.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/examples.snippet.create-an-object.cpp
    :language: cpp

Model
`````

For more information about modeling an object, refer to: 
:ref:`cpp-define-a-new-object-type`.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/examples.snippet.single-object-model.cpp
    :language: cpp

.. _cpp-create-an-embedded-object:

Create an Embedded Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create an embedded object, assign an instance of the embedded object
to a parent object's property. Pass the parent object to the 
:cpp-sdk:`Realm.add() function <structrealm_1_1db.html>` inside of a 
write transaction.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/define-object-model.snippet.create-embedded-object.cpp
    :language: cpp

This adds both the parent object and the embedded object to the realm. 
The embedded object does not have its own lifecycle independent of the parent
object. If you delete the parent object, the embedded object is also deleted.

For more information about modeling an embedded object, refer to: 
:ref:`cpp-embedded-object`.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/define-object-model.snippet.model-with-embedded-object.cpp
    :language: cpp

.. _cpp-create-an-object-with-to-one-relationship:

Create an Object with a To-One Relationship
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create an object with a to-one relationship link to another object, 
assign an instance of the linked object to the related object's property.
Pass the main object to the :cpp-sdk:`Realm.add() function
<structrealm_1_1db.html>` inside of a write transaction.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/define-object-model.snippet.create-object-with-to-one-relationship.cpp
    :language: cpp

This adds both the main object and the linked object to the realm, and 
creates a one-way connection from the main object to the linked object.

In other Realm SDKs, you can create an inverse link to refer to the main object
from the linked object. However, inverse links are not yet supported in the 
Realm C++ SDK.

The linked object has its own lifecycle independent of the main object. If 
you delete the main object, the linked object remains.

:ref:`cpp-define-a-to-one-relationship-property`.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/define-object-model.snippet.to-one-relationship.cpp
    :language: cpp

.. _cpp-create-an-object-with-to-many-relationship:

Create an Object with a To-Many Relationship
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create an object with a to-many relationship link to one or more objects:

- Initialize the main object and the linked objects
- Use the :cpp-sdk:`push_back 
  <structrealm_1_1persisted_3_01std_1_1vector_3_01T_01_4_00_01std_1_1enable__if__t_3_01std_1_1is__bf25bc7461a39304fb47e25c96413fa0e.html>`
  member function available to the Realm object lists
  to append the linked objects to the main object's list property
- Pass the main object to the to the :cpp-sdk:`Realm.add() function
  <structrealm_1_1db.html>` inside of a write transaction.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/define-object-model.snippet.create-object-with-to-many-relationship.cpp
    :language: cpp

This adds the main object and the linked objects to the realm, and creates 
a one-way connection from the main object to the linked objects. 

In other Realm SDKs, you can create an inverse link to refer to the main object
from the linked objects. However, inverse links are not yet supported in the 
Realm C++ SDK.

The linked objects have their own lifecycles independent of the main 
object. If you delete the main object, the linked objects remain.

    :language: cpp

.. _cpp-create-object-map-property:

Create an Object with a Map Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you create an object that has a :cpp-sdk:`map property 
<classrealm_1_1persisted__map__base.html>`, you can set the values for 
keys in a few ways: 

- Set keys and values on the object and then add the object to the realm
- Set the object's keys and values directly inside a write transaction

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/define-object-model.snippet.create-map-object.cpp
    :language: cpp

:ref:`cpp-map`.

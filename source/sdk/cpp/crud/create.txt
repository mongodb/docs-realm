Key Concept: Transactions
-------------------------

Write Transactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Realm uses a highly efficient storage engine
to persist objects. You can **create** objects in a realm,
**update** objects in a realm, and eventually **delete**
objects from a realm. Because these operations modify the
state of the realm, we call them writes.

Realm handles writes in terms of **transactions**. A
transaction is a list of read and write operations that
Realm treats as a single indivisible operation. In other
words, a transaction is *all or nothing*: either all of the
operations in the transaction succeed or none of the
operations in the transaction take effect. 

All writes must happen in a transaction.

A realm allows only one open transaction at a time. Realm
blocks other writes on other threads until the open
transaction is complete. Consequently, there is no race
condition when reading values from the realm within a
transaction.

When you are done with your transaction, Realm either
**commits** it or **cancels** it:

- When Realm **commits** a transaction, Realm writes
  all changes to disk. For synced realms, the SDK queues the change
  for synchronization with Atlas Device Sync.
- When Realm **cancels** a write transaction or an operation in
  the transaction causes an error, all changes are discarded
  (or "rolled back").

Create a New Object

Create an Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Current
      :tabid: current

      To add an object to a realm, instantiate it as you would any other
      object. Then pass it to the :cpp-sdk:`Realm.add() function
      <structrealm_1_1db.html>` inside of a write transaction.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/crud.snippet.create-an-object.cpp
         :language: cpp

   .. tab:: Experimental
      :tabid: experimental

      To create an object, instantiate it as you would any other
      object. Move the object into the realm using the
      :cpp-sdk:`Realm.add() function <structrealm_1_1db.html>` 
      inside of a write transaction.

      When you move an object into a realm, this consumes the object as an 
      rvalue. You must use the managed object for any data access or observation.
      In this example, copying the ``dog`` into the realm consumes it as an 
      rvalue. You can return the managed object to continue to work with it.

Create an Embedded Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Current
      :tabid: current

      To create an embedded object, assign an instance of the embedded object
      to a parent object's property. Pass the parent object to the 
      :cpp-sdk:`Realm.add() function <structrealm_1_1db.html>` inside of a 
      write transaction.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/define-object-model.snippet.create-embedded-object.cpp
         :language: cpp

      This adds both the parent object and the embedded object to the realm. 
      The embedded object does not have its own lifecycle independent of the parent
      object. If you delete the parent object, the embedded object is also deleted.

   .. tab:: Experimental
      :tabid: experimental

      To create an embedded object, assign the raw pointer of the embedded 
      object to a parent object's property. Move the parent object into 
      the realm using the :cpp-sdk:`Realm.add() function <structrealm_1_1db.html>` 
      inside of a write transaction.

      In this example, we assign the raw pointer of the embedded object - 
      ``ContactDetails *`` - to the embedded object property of the parent 
      object - ``Business.contactDetails``.
      
      Then, when we add the ``Business`` to the realm, this copies the 
      ``Business`` and ``ContactDetails`` objects to the realm. 

      Because ``ContactDetails`` is an embedded object, it does not have
      its own lifecycle independent of the main ``Business`` object. 
      If you delete the ``Business`` object, this also deletes the 
      ``ContactDetails`` object.

      To create an object with a to-one relationship to another object, 
      assign an instance of the linked object to the related object's property.
      Pass the main object to the :cpp-sdk:`Realm.add() function
      <structrealm_1_1db.html>` inside of a write transaction.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/define-object-model.snippet.create-object-with-to-one-relationship.cpp

      This adds both the main object and the linked object to the realm, and 
      creates a one-way connection from the main object to the linked object.

      The linked object has its own lifecycle independent of the main object. If 
      you delete the main object, the linked object remains.

   .. tab:: Experimental

      To create an object with a to-many relationship to one or more objects:

      - Initialize the main object and the linked objects
      - Use the :cpp-sdk:`push_back 
        <structrealm_1_1persisted_3_01std_1_1vector_3_01T_01_4_00_01std_1_1enable__if__t_3_01std_1_1is__bf25bc7461a39304fb47e25c96413fa0e.html>`

Create an Object with an Inverse Relationship
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 0.2.0

To create an object with a inverse relationship to another object, 
assign the raw pointer of the related object to the relationship 
property of the main object. Move the object into the realm using the 
:cpp-sdk:`Realm.add() function <structrealm_1_1db.html>` 
inside of a write transaction.

In this example, we create two ``Person`` objects that each have a to-one 
relationship to the same ``Dog`` object. The ``Dog`` has an inverse 
relationship to the ``Person`` objects that is automatically updated when 
the ``Person`` object updates its ``Dog`` relationship.

This functionality is only available in the ``realm::experimental`` namespace.
You must define models and open the realm using the ``realm::experimental``
declarations.

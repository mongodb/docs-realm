.. _cpp-read-from-realm:

Key Concept: Read from Realm Database
-------------------------------------

A read from a realm generally consists of the following
steps:

- Get all objects of a certain type from the realm.
- Optionally, filter the results.

:cpp-sdk:`Query operations <structrealm_1_1query.html>` return a 
:cpp-sdk:`results collection <structrealm_1_1results.html>`. These
collections are live, meaning they always contain the latest
results of the associated query.

.. _cpp-realm-read-characteristics:

Read Characteristics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Design your app's data access patterns around these three key 
read characteristics to read data as efficiently as possible.

.. _cpp-results-are-not-copies:

Results Are Not Copies
``````````````````````

Results to a query are not copies of your data. Modifying
the results of a query modifies the data on disk
directly. This memory mapping also means that results are
**live**: that is, they always reflect the current state on
disk.

.. _cpp-results-are-lazy:
.. _cpp-lazy-evaluated-results:

Results Are Lazy
````````````````

Realm Database only runs a query when you actually request the
results of that query. This lazy evaluation enables you to write
highly performant code for handling large data sets and complex
queries. You can chain several filter operations without requiring 
extra work to process the intermediate state.

.. _cpp-references-retained:

References Are Retained
```````````````````````

One benefit of Realm Database's object model is that
Realm Database automatically retains all of an object's
:ref:`relationships <cpp-relationships>` as direct
references. This enables you to traverse your graph of relationships
directly through the results of a query.

A **direct reference**, or pointer, allows you to access a
related object's properties directly through the reference.

Other databases typically copy objects from database storage
into application memory when you need to work with them
directly. Because application objects contain direct
references, you are left with a choice: copy the object
referred to by each direct reference out of the database in
case it's needed, or just copy the foreign key for each
object and query for the object with that key if it's
accessed. If you choose to copy referenced objects into
application memory, you can use up a lot of resources for
objects that are never accessed, but if you choose to only
copy the foreign key, referenced object lookups can cause
your application to slow down.

Realm Database bypasses all of this using zero-copy
live objects. Realm object accessors point
directly into database storage using memory mapping, so there is no
distinction between the objects in Realm Database and the results
of your query in application memory. Because of this, you can traverse
direct references across an entire realm from any query result.

.. _cpp-limiting-results:

Limiting Query Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As a result of lazy evaluation, you do not need any special mechanism to
limit query results with Realm Database. For example, if your query
matches thousands of objects, but you only want to load the first ten,
simply access only the first ten elements of the results collection.

.. _cpp-pagination:

Pagination
~~~~~~~~~~

Thanks to lazy evaluation, the common task of pagination becomes quite
simple. For example, suppose you have a results collection associated
with a query that matches thousands of objects in your realm. You
display one hundred objects per page. To advance to any page, simply
access the elements of the results collection starting at the index that
corresponds to the target page.

.. _cpp-read-operations:

Read Realm Objects
------------------

.. _cpp-query-all-objects-of-a-given-type:

Query All Objects of a Given Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To query for objects of a given type in a realm, pass the object type 
``YourClassName`` to the :cpp-sdk:`realm::query<T>
<structrealm_1_1query.html>` public member function.

This returns a :cpp-sdk:`Results <structrealm_1_1results.html>` object
representing all objects of the given type in the realm.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/define-object-model.snippet.read-objects-from-realm.cpp
    :language: cpp

.. _cpp-filter-queries-based-on-object-properties:

Filter Queries Based on Object Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A filter selects a subset of results based on the value(s) of one or
more object properties. Realm Database provides a full-featured 
query engine that you can use to define filters.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/define-object-model.snippet.filter-using-type-safe-query.cpp
    :language: cpp

.. _cpp-supported-query-operators:

Supported Query Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Currently, the Realm C++ SDK Alpha supports the following query operators:

- Equality (``==``, ``!=``)
- Greater than/less than (``>``, ``>=``, ``<``, ``<=``)
- Compound queries (``||``, ``&&``)

.. _cpp-check-results-size-access-results:

Check the Size of the Results Set and Access Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Realm :cpp-sdk:`Results <structrealm_1_1results.html>` exposes public member 
functions to work with results. You may want to check the size of a results
set, or access the object at a specific index.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/define-object-model.snippet.check-size-and-access-results.cpp
    :language: cpp

Additionally, you can iterate through the results, or observe a results
set for changes.

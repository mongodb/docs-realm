.. _cpp-delete-realm-objects:

Delete Realm Objects
--------------------

Deleting Realm Objects must occur within write transactions. For
more information about write trasactions, see: :ref:`Write Transactions 
<cpp-write-transactions>`.

Delete an Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Current
      :tabid: current

      To delete an object from a realm, pass the object to
      :cpp-sdk:`Realm.remove() function <structrealm_1_1experimental_1_1db.html>`
      inside of a write transaction.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/crud.snippet.beta-delete-an-object.cpp
         :language: cpp

      .. include:: /includes/tip-cpp-beta-experimental-features.rst

   .. tab:: Deprecated
      :tabid: deprecated

      To delete an object from a realm, pass the object to
      :cpp-sdk:`Realm.remove() function <structrealm_1_1db.html>`
      inside of a write transaction.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/crud.snippet.delete-an-object.cpp
         :language: cpp

.. _cpp-delete-inverse-relationship:

Delete an Inverse Relationship
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 0.2.0

You can't delete an inverse relationship directly. Instead, an 
inverse relationship automatically updates by removing the relationship 
through the related object.

In this example, a ``Person`` has a to-one relationship to a ``Dog``,
and the ``Dog`` has an inverse relationship to ``Person``.
Setting the ``Person.dog`` relationship to ``nullptr`` removes the inverse
relationship from the ``Dog`` object. 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/relationships.snippet.beta-delete-inverse-relationship.cpp
   :language: cpp

.. include:: /includes/tip-cpp-beta-experimental-features.rst

Model
`````

This example uses the following model:

.. _cpp-delete-map:

Delete Map Keys/Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To delete a :cpp-sdk:`map key <classrealm_1_1persisted__map__base.html>`, 
pass the key name to ``erase()``:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Current
      :tabid: current

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/crud.snippet.beta-delete-map-value.cpp
         :language: cpp

      .. include:: /includes/tip-cpp-beta-experimental-features.rst

   .. tab:: Deprecated
      :tabid: deprecated

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/define-object-model.snippet.delete-map-value.cpp
         :language: cpp

.. _cpp-delete-set-values:

Delete Set Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: v0.4.0-preview

You can delete a :cpp-sdk:`set element 
<structrealm_1_1experimental_1_1managed_3_01std_1_1set_3_01T_01_5_01_4_01_4.html>` 
with ``erase()``, or remove all elements from a set with ``clear()``.

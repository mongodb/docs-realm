.. _cpp-delete-realm-objects:

Delete Realm Objects
--------------------

Deleting Realm Objects must occur within write transactions. For
more information about write trasactions, see: :ref:`Key Concept: 
Transactions <cpp-write-transactions>`.

Delete an Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To delete an object from a realm, pass the object to
:cpp-sdk:`Realm.remove() function <structrealm_1_1db.html>`
inside of a write transaction.

.. _cpp-delete-inverse-relationship:

Delete an Inverse Relationship
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can't delete an inverse relationship directly. Instead, an 
inverse relationship automatically updates by removing the relationship 
through the related object.

In this example, a ``Person`` has a to-one relationship to a ``Dog``,
and the ``Dog`` has an inverse relationship to ``Person``.
Setting the ``Person.dog`` relationship to ``nullptr`` removes the inverse
relationship from the ``Dog`` object.

Model

This example uses the following model:

.. _cpp-delete-map:

Delete Map Keys/Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To delete a :cpp-sdk:`map key <classrealm_1_1persisted__map__base.html>`, 
pass the key name to ``erase()``:

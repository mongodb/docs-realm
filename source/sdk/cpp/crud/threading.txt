To create performant apps, developers must write thread-safe and maintainable
multithreaded code that avoids issues like deadlocking and race conditions.
Realm provides tools specifically designed for performant multithreaded apps.

.. _cpp-threading-three-rules:

Three Rules to Follow
---------------------

Before exploring Realm's tools for multithreaded apps, you need to 
understand and follow these three rules:

Don't lock to read:
  Realm's :ref:`Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC) <cpp-mvcc>`
  architecture eliminates the need to lock for read operations. The values you
  read will never be corrupted or in a partially-modified state. You can freely
  read from the same Realm file on any thread without the need for locks or
  mutexes. Unnecessarily locking would be a performance bottleneck since each
  thread might need to wait its turn before reading.

Avoid synchronous writes on the UI thread if you write on a background thread:
  You can write to a Realm file from any thread, but there can be only one
  writer at a time. Consequently, synchronous write transactions block each
  other. A synchronous write on the UI thread may result in your app appearing
  unresponsive while it waits for a write on a background thread to complete.
  :ref:`Device Sync <sync>` writes on a background thread, so you should avoid
  synchronous writes on the UI thread with synced realms.

Don't pass live objects, collections, or realms to other threads:
  Live objects, collections, and realm instances are **thread-confined**: that
  is, they are only valid on the thread on which they were created. Practically
  speaking, this means you cannot pass live instances to other threads. However,
  Realm offers several mechanisms for :ref:`sharing objects across
  threads <cpp-communication-across-threads>`.

.. _cpp-communication-across-threads:

Communication Across Threads
----------------------------

To access the same Realm file from different threads, you must instantiate a
realm instance on every thread that needs access. As long as you specify the same
configuration, all realm instances will map to the same file on disk.

One of the key rules when working with Realm in a multithreaded
environment is that objects are thread-confined: **you cannot access the
instances of a realm, collection, or object that originated on other threads.**
Realm's :ref:`Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC) <cpp-mvcc>`
architecture means that there could be many active versions of an object at any
time. Thread-confinement ensures that all instances in that thread are of the
same internal version.

When you need to communicate across threads, you have several options depending
on your use case:

- To modify an object on two threads, :ref:`query <cpp-client-query-engine>`
  for the object on both threads.

- To react to changes made on any thread, use Realm's
  :ref:`notifications <cpp-react-to-changes>`.

- To see changes that happened on another thread in the current thread's realm
  instance, :ref:`refresh <cpp-refreshing-realms>` your realm instance.

- To share an instance of a realm or specific object with another thread, share
  a :ref:`thread_safe_reference <cpp-thread-safe-reference>` to the realm
  instance or object.

.. _cpp-thread-safe-reference:

Pass Instances Across Threads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instances of ``realm::realm``, ``realm::results``, and ``realm::object`` are
*thread-confined*. That means you may only use them on the thread where you
created them.

You can copy thread-confined instances to another thread as follows:

1. Initialize a :cpp-sdk:`thread_safe_reference 
   <structrealm_1_1thread__safe__reference_3_01db_3_01Ts_8_8_8_01_4_01_4.html>` 
   with the thread-confined object.
#. Pass the reference to the target thread.
#. Resolve the reference on the target thread. If the referred object is a realm
   instance, resolve it by calling ``.resolve()``; otherwise, move the reference
   to ``realm.resolve()``. The returned object is now thread-confined on the
   target thread, as if it had been created on the target thread instead of the
   original thread.

.. important::

   You must resolve a ``thread_safe_reference`` exactly once. Otherwise,
   the source realm will remain pinned until the reference gets
   deallocated. For this reason, ``thread_safe_reference`` should be
   short-lived.

   .. tab:: Deprecated
      :tabid: deprecated

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/threading.snippet.thread-safe-reference.cpp
         :language: cpp

Another way to work with an object on another thread is to query for it
again on that thread. But if the object does not have a primary
key, it is not trivial to query for it. You can use ``thread_safe_reference`` 
on any object, regardless of whether it has a primary key.

.. _ios-use-realm-across-threads:

Use the Same Realm Across Threads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You cannot share realm instances across threads.

To use the same Realm file across threads, open a different realm instance on
each thread. As long as you use the same :cpp-sdk:`configuration
<structrealm_1_1internal_1_1bridge_1_1realm_1_1config.html>`, all Realm
instances will map to the same file on disk.

.. _cpp-scheduler-thread-management:

Schedulers (Run Loops)
----------------------

Some platforms or frameworks automatically set up a **scheduler** (or **run
loop**), which continuously processes events during the lifetime of your
app. The Realm C++ SDK detects and uses schedulers on the following
platforms or frameworks:

- macOS, iOS, tvOS, watchOS
- Android
- Qt

Realm uses the scheduler to schedule work such as Device Sync upload and
download.

If your platform does not have a supported scheduler, or you otherwise want to
use a custom scheduler, you can implement :cpp-sdk:`realm::scheduler
<structrealm_1_1scheduler.html>` and pass the instance to the :cpp-sdk:`realm::db_config
<structrealm_1_1internal_1_1bridge_1_1realm_1_1config.html>` you use to
configure the realm. Realm will use the scheduler you pass to it.

.. _cpp-refreshing-realms:

Refreshing Realms
-----------------

On any thread controlled by a scheduler or run loop, Realm automatically
refreshes objects at the start of every run loop iteration. Between run loop
iterations, you will be working on the snapshot, so individual methods always
see a consistent view and never have to worry about what happens on other
threads.

When you initially open a realm on a thread, its state will be the most recent
successful write commit, and it will remain on that version until refreshed. If
a thread is not controlled by a run loop, then the :cpp-sdk:`realm.refresh()
<structrealm_1_1db.html>` method must be called manually in order to advance the
transaction to the most recent state.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/threading.snippet.refresh.cpp
    :language: cpp

.. note:: 
   
   Failing to refresh realms on a regular basis could lead to some transaction 
   versions becoming "pinned", preventing Realm from reusing the disk space used
   by that version and leading to larger file sizes. 

.. _cpp-mvcc:

Realm's Threading Model in Depth
--------------------------------

Realm provides safe, fast, lock-free, and concurrent access
across threads with its :wikipedia:`Multiversion Concurrency
Control (MVCC) <Multiversion_concurrency_control>`
architecture.

Compared and Contrasted with Git
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are familiar with a distributed version control
system like `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`__, you may already
have an intuitive understanding of MVCC. Two fundamental
elements of Git are:

- Commits, which are atomic writes.
- Branches, which are different versions of the commit history.

Similarly, Realm has atomically-committed writes in the form
of transactions. Realm also has many different versions of the 
history at any given time, like branches.

Unlike Git, which actively supports distribution and
divergence through forking, a realm only has one true latest
version at any given time and always writes to the head of
that latest version. Realm cannot write to a previous
version. This means your data converges on one
latest version of the truth.

Internal Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A realm is implemented using a :wikipedia:`B+ tree
<B%2B_tree>` data structure. The top-level node represents a
version of the realm; child nodes are objects in that
version of the realm. The realm has a pointer to its latest
version, much like how Git has a pointer to its HEAD commit.

Realm uses a copy-on-write technique to ensure
:wikipedia:`isolation <Isolation_(database_systems)>` and
:wikipedia:`durability <Durability_(database_systems)>`.
When you make changes, Realm copies the relevant part of the
tree for writing. Realm then commits the changes in two
phases:

- Realm writes changes to disk and verifies success.
- Realm then sets its latest version pointer to point to the newly-written version.

This two-step commit process guarantees that even if the
write failed partway, the original version is not corrupted
in any way because the changes were made to a copy of the
relevant part of the tree. Likewise, the realm's root
pointer will point to the original version until the new
version is guaranteed to be valid.

.. include:: /includes/commit-process-diagram.rst

Realm uses zero-copy techniques
like memory mapping to handle data. When you read a value
from the realm, you are virtually looking at the value on
the actual disk, not a copy of it. This is the basis for
:ref:`live objects <cpp-live-object>`. This is also why a realm
head pointer can be set to point to the new version after
the write to disk has been validated.

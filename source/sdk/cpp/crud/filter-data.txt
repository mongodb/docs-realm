Overview
--------

To filter data in your realm, you can leverage
Realm Database's query engine. 

About the Examples on This Page
-------------------------------
   
The examples in this page use a simple data set for a
todo list app. The two Realm object types are ``Project``
and ``Item``. An ``Item`` has:

- A name
- A completed flag
- An optional assignee's name
- A count of minutes spent working on it

A ``Project`` has a name and a to-many relationship to zero or more ``Items``.

The schema for ``Project`` and ``Item`` is:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/cpp/filter-data.snippet.models.cpp
   :language: cpp

You can set up the realm for these examples with the following code:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/cpp/filter-data.snippet.models.cpp
   :language: cpp

A **realm** is the core data structure used to organize data in
Realm. A realm is a collection of the objects that you use 
in your application, called Realm objects, as well as additional metadata 
that describe the objects.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Current
      :tabid: current

      When opening a realm using the ``realm::experimental`` namespace, 
      you must specify a :cpp-sdk:`db_config 
      <structrealm_1_1internal_1_1bridge_1_1realm_1_1config.html>`.
      The ``db_config`` may contain information such as:

      - An optional path where the realm is stored on device
      - An optional list of models that the realm should manage
      - An optional scheduler if you need to customize the run loop
      - A ``sync_config`` if you want to use the realm with Device Sync

      You can use the default ``db_config`` constructor if you do not need
      to specify a realm file path, a Device Sync configuration, or other
      configuration details.

   .. tab:: Deprecated
      :tabid: deprecated

      When you open a realm, the ``open`` or ``async_open`` templates 
      construct a :cpp-sdk:`db_config 
      <structrealm_1_1internal_1_1bridge_1_1realm_1_1config.html>` that 
      specifies details about how to configure the realm file. This can include:

      - The models that the realm file should manage
      - An optional path where the realm is stored on device
      - An optional scheduler if you need to customize the run loop
      - A ``sync_config`` if you want to use the realm with Device Sync

.. _cpp-realm-file:

Realm Files
-----------

Realm stores a binary encoded version of every object and type in a
realm in a single ``.realm`` file. The file is located at :ref:`a specific 
path <find-the-default-realm-path>` that you can define when you open the realm.
You can open, view, and edit the contents of these files with 
:ref:`realm-studio`.

.. see:: Auxiliary Realm Files
   
   Realm creates additional files for each realm.
   To learn more about these files, see :ref:`Realm Internals
   <cpp-realm-database>`.

.. _cpp-synced-realm:

Synced Realms
-------------

You can configure a realm to automatically synchronize data between many 
devices that each have their own local copy of the data. Synced realms 
need a ``sync_config`` and require an Atlas App Services backend to handle 
the synchronization process. 

Applications can always create, modify, and delete synced realm objects locally,
even when offline. Whenever a network connection is available, the Realm SDK
opens a connection to an application server and syncs changes to and from other
clients. The :ref:`Atlas Device Sync protocol <sync-protocol>` and server-side
operational transforms guarantee that all fully synced instances of a realm see
exactly the same data, even if some changes occurred offline and/or were
received out of order.

Synced Realms vs. Non-Synced Realms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Synced realms differ from non-synced local Realm in a 
few ways:

- Synced realms attempt to sync changes with your backend App Services App,
  whereas non-synced realms do not.
- Synced realms can only be accessed by authenticated users, while non-synced 
  realms have no concept of users or authentication.
- With synced realms, you can download updates before opening a 
  realm. However, requiring changes to download before opening the 
  realm requires the user to be online. Non-synced realms can always 
  be used offline.

You can manually copy data from a non-synced realm to a synced realm, 
and vice versa, but you cannot sync a non-synced realm.

.. _cpp-open-non-sync-realm:

Open a Non-Sync Realm
---------------------

You can open a realm in the current directory using the default constructor.
Or you can construct a ``db_config`` with a specific file path to open the realm
in a specific location.

.. _cpp-default-realm:

Open the Default Realm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Opening a realm without specifying an optional path opens the default realm 
in the current directory.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Current
      :tabid: current

      When opening a realm using the ``realm::experimental`` namespace, the 
      C++ SDK Preview can automatically infer which models are available in the
      project. You don't need to manually specify the available models.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/crud.snippet.beta-open-realm.cpp
         :language: cpp

      However, if you want the realm to manage only a subset of classes, you
      can specify those models by passing them into the template parameter list
      of the ``realm::experimental::open()`` function.

      This method currently requires a string path, and does not accept a ``db_config``.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/crud.snippet.beta-realm-specify-classes.cpp
         :language: cpp

      .. include:: /includes/tip-cpp-beta-experimental-features.rst

   .. tab:: Deprecated
      :tabid: deprecated

      When opening a realm, you must specify which models are available by passing 
      the models into the template parameter list of the ``realm::open()`` function.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/open-realm.snippet.open-default-realm.cpp
         :language: cpp

.. tip:: Building an Android App

   When building an Android app that uses the Realm C++ SDK Preview, 
   you must pass the ``filesDir.path`` to the ``path`` parameter in the 
   :cpp-sdk:`db_config <structrealm_1_1internal_1_1bridge_1_1realm_1_1config.html>` 
   constructor. For more information, refer to: :ref:`cpp-build-android-app`.

.. _cpp-realm-at-path:

Open a Realm at a File Path
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Current
      :tabid: current

      You can use ``set_path()`` to specify a path for the ``db_config`` 
      to use when opening the realm.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/crud.snippet.beta-open-realm-at-path.cpp
         :language: cpp

      .. include:: /includes/tip-cpp-beta-experimental-features.rst

   .. tab:: Deprecated
      :tabid: deprecated

      If you need to open a realm at a specific file path, you can pass a path 
      to the realm open template.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/cpp/open-realm.snippet.open-realm-at-path.cpp
         :language: cpp

.. tip:: Building an Android App

   When building an Android app that uses the Realm C++ SDK Preview, 
   you must pass the ``filesDir.path`` as the ``path`` parameter in the
   :cpp-sdk:`db_config <structrealm_1_1internal_1_1bridge_1_1realm_1_1config.html>` 
   constructor. For more information, refer to: :ref:`cpp-build-android-app`.

.. _cpp-open-synced-realm:

Open a Synced Realm
-------------------

You must have an :ref:`Atlas App Services App <create-app-ui>` that you 
have :ref:`configured for Flexible Sync <enable-realm-sync>` in order to 
sync data between devices.

To open a synced realm:

1. Connect to an Atlas App Services App.
#. Authenticate the user.
#. Create a sync configuration.
#. Open the user's synced realm with the configuration.

   .. tab:: Deprecated
      :tabid: deprecated

      To open a synced realm, pass the models you want the realm to manage into the 
      template parameter list of the :cpp-sdk:`async_open 
      <structrealm_1_1async__open__promise.html>` function, and pass the configuration 
      as an argument to the function.

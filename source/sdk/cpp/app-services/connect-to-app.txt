Overview
--------

The App client is the Atlas App Services backend interface. It provides access 
to authentication and Atlas Functions.

Some of your App Services App's features are associated with user accounts. For example, you
need to :ref:`authenticate a user <cpp-authenticate-user>` before you can access
your App's functions.

Before You Begin
----------------

#. :ref:`Create an App Services app <create-a-realm-app>`

.. _cpp-access-the-app-client:

Access the App Client
---------------------

#. :ref:`Find the App ID in the Realm UI <find-your-app-id>`.
#. Create an :cpp-sdk:`App object <classrealm_1_1App.html>` 
   with your App's ID as the argument. You use this ``App`` instance to access 
   App Services features throughout your client application.

.. tip:: Building an Android App

   When building an Android app that uses the Realm C++ SDK Preview, 
   you must pass the ``filesDir.path`` to the ``file_path`` parameter in the 
   :cpp-sdk:`db_config <structrealm_1_1internal_1_1bridge_1_1realm_1_1config.html>` 
   constructor. For more information, refer to: :ref:`cpp-build-android-app`.

Resolve Build Issues
--------------------

Some developers experience build issues after installing {+backend+} via 
CocoaPods or Carthage. Common causes of these issues include:

- Installation issues:
  - Initial install failed
  - Using an unsupported version of the dependency manager
- Build tool issues:
  - Build tools have stale caches
  - Updating build tool versions
- Making changes to your project setup, such as:
  - Adding a new target 
  - Sharing dependencies across targets

A fix that often clears these issues is to delete derived data 
and clean the Xcode build folder.

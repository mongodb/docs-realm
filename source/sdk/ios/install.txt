Overview

{+service+}'s Swift SDK enables your iOS, macOS, tvOS,
and watchOS applications to interact with {+service+} using either
the Swift or Objective-C programming languages. This page
details how to install {+service-short+} in your project and get
started.

Before getting started, ensure your development environment
meets the following prerequisites:

- `Xcode <https://developer.apple.com/xcode/>`__ version 11.3 or higher.
- Target of iOS 9.0 or higher, macOS 10.9 or higher, tvOS 9.0 or higher, or watchOS 2.0 or higher.
- If using Swift Package Manager, target of iOS 11+ or macOS 10.10+ is required.

.. important::

   There are special considerations when using {+client-database+} with
   tvOS. See :ref:`ios-tvos` for more information.

Overview
--------
The {+service-short+} community has created many applications that demonstrate
the usage of the Realm iOS SDK. This page contains some of these applications,
and the MongoDB Documentation team will update this page with additional
examples over time.

.. note:: 

   The MongoDB Documentation team does not directly maintain these examples. 

Examples by the Realm Engineering Team
--------------------------------------
The :github:`realm-cocoa example applications
<realm/realm-cocoa/tree/master/examples>` provide examples for both iOS and
macOS that demonstrate how to use {+service-short+} features such as migrations
and encryption. The examples also demonstrate how to combine {+service-short+}
with common iOS concepts like ``UITableViewController``.

Overview
--------
There are many examples of applications that the {+realm+} community has
created. This page contains some of these applications, and the MongoDB documentation
team will update this page with additional examples over time.

.. note:: 

   The MongoDB Documentation team does not directly maintain these examples. 

Examples by the Realm Engineering Team

You can find :github:`example applications
<realm/realm-cocoa/tree/master/examples>` for both iOS and macOS that
demonstrate how to use many Realm features, such as migrations, encryption, use
of {+realm+} with UITableViewControllers, and more.

Overview
--------
The {+service-short+} community has created many applications that demonstrate
the usage of the Realm iOS SDK. This page contains some of these applications,
and the MongoDB Documentation team will update this page with additional
examples over time.

.. note:: 

   The MongoDB Documentation team does not directly maintain these examples. 

Examples by the Realm Engineering Team
--------------------------------------
You can find :github:`example applications
<realm/realm-cocoa/tree/master/examples>` for both iOS and macOS that
demonstrate how to use many Realm features, such as migrations, encryption, use
of {+realm+} with ``UITableViewController``, and more.

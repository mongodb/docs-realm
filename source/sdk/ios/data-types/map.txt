   ``Map``

Overview
--------
The :swift-sdk:`Map <Classes/Map.html>` is an associative array that
contains key-value pairs with unique keys.

Like Swift's :apple:`Dictionary <documentation/swift/dictionary>`,
``Map`` is a generic type that is parameterized on its key and value
types. Unlike :apple:`native Swift collections
<documentation/swift/swift_standard_library/collections>`,
{+service-short+} Maps are reference types (classes), as opposed to
value types (structs).

Usage
-----
You can declare a Map as a property of an object:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/MapExample.codeblock.models.swift
   :language: swift

You can then update, check values, iterate over, and delete from the Map
as you would a standard :apple:`Dictionary
<documentation/swift/dictionary>`:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/MapExample.codeblock.map.swift
   :language: swift

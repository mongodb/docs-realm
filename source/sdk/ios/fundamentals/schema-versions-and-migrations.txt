Schema Version
--------------

A **schema version** identifies the state of a :ref:`{+backend-schema+}
<ios-realm-schema>` at some point in time. {+client-database+} tracks the schema
version of each {+realm+} and uses it to map the objects in each {+realm+}
to the correct schema.

Schema versions are integers that you may include
in the {+realm+} configuration when you open a {+realm+}. If a client
application does not specify a version number when it opens a {+realm+} then
the {+realm+} defaults to version ``0``.

.. important:: Increment Versions Monotonically

   :ref:`Migrations <ios-client-migrations>` must update a {+realm+} to a
   higher schema version. {+client-database+} will throw an error if a client
   application opens a {+realm+} with a schema version that is lower than
   the {+realm+}'s current version or if the specified schema version is the
   same as the {+realm+}'s current version but includes different
   :ref:`object schemas <ios-object-schema>`.

.. tip::

   To learn how to change the {+realm+} version and perform a migration,
   see :ref:`ios-modify-an-object-schema`.

.. _ios-migrations:

Migrations
----------

A **local migration** is a migration for a {+realm+} that does
not automatically :doc:`{+sync-short+} </sync>` with
another {+realm+}. Local migrations have access to the existing
{+backend-schema+}, version, and objects and define logic that
incrementally updates the {+realm+} to its new schema version.
To perform a local migration you must specify a new schema
version that is higher than the current version and provide
a migration function when you open the out-of-date {+realm+}.

In iOS, you can update underlying data to reflect schema changes using
manual migrations. During such a manual migration, you can define new
and deleted properties when they are added or removed from your schema.

Auxiliary Files
===============

Realm generates and maintains additional files and directories for its
own internal operations:

.realm.lock
  A lock file for resource locks.

.realm.management
  Directory of interprocess lock files.

.realm.note
  A named pipe for interprocess notifications.

These files don’t have any effect on .realm database files, and won’t
cause any erroneous behavior if their parent database file is deleted or
replaced.

.. note::

   When reporting Realm issues, please be sure to include these
   auxiliary files along with your main .realm file as they contain
   useful information for debugging purposes.

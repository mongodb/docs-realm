When using :doc:`{+sync+} </sync>`, a **client reset** is a serious
error recovery task that your client app must perform in the following
situation:

- The given synced {+realm+} on the server was restored from a backup.
  For example, due to a {+service-short+} server crash.

- The client app made changes to that {+realm+} since the backup was made,
  but did not sync those changes back to the server before the server
  was restored.

In other words, the client app must carry out a client reset on a given
synced {+realm+} if the server is restored to a version older than the
version on the client.

A client reset erases all local data and downloads a new copy of the
data stored in MongoDB Atlas. Performing a client reset loses all local
changes made since the client last successfully synced.

Example
-------

By default, the SDK performs client resets automatically on startup when
instructed to do so by the server. When a client reset occurs, the SDK
creates a backup of local data. By default, the SDK makes no effort to
recover lost local changes from this backup.

If you override the client reset handler, you can access this backup
copy through the path stored in the :objc-sdk:`SyncError
<Enums/RLMSyncError.html#/c:@E@RLMSyncError@RLMSyncErrorClientResetError>`
to manually transfer data from the backup copy to the newly created
{+realm+}.

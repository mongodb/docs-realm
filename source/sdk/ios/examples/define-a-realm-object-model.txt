Define a New Object Type
------------------------

   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      You can define a Realm object by deriving from the
      :swift-sdk:`Object <Extensions/Object.html>` or
      :swift-sdk:`EmbeddedObject <Extensions/EmbeddedObject.html>`
      class. The name of the class becomes the table name in the realm,
      and properties of the class persist in the database. This makes it
      as easy to work with persisted objects as it is to work with
      regular Swift objects.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ObjectModels.codeblock.define-a-model.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      You can define a Realm object by deriving from the
      :objc-sdk:`RLMObject <Classes/RLMObject.html>` or
      :objc-sdk:`RLMEmbeddedObject
      <Classes/RLMEmbeddedObject.html>` class. The name of the
      class becomes the table name in the realm, and properties of the
      class persist in the database. This makes it as easy to work with
      persisted objects as it is to work with regular Objective-C
      objects.

.. _ios-declare-a-property:

Declare Properties
------------------

.. tip::

   For reference on which types {+client-database+} supports for use as
   properties, see :ref:`ios-supported-property-types`.

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      When declaring non-generic properties, use the ``@objc dynamic
      var`` annotation. The ``@objc dynamic var`` attribute turns Realm
      model properties into accessors for the underlying database data.
      If the class is declared as ``@objcMembers`` (Swift 4 or later),
      you can declare properties as ``dynamic var`` without ``@objc``.

      To declare properties of generic types ``LinkingObjects``,
      ``List``, and ``RealmOptional``, use ``let``. Generic properties
      cannot be represented in the Objective‑C runtime, which
      {+client-database+} uses for dynamic dispatch of dynamic
      properties.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      Declare properties on your object type as you would on a normal
      Objective-C interface.
      
      In order to use your interface in a Realm array, pass your
      interface name to the ``RLM_ARRAY_TYPE()`` macro. You can put this
      at the bottom of your interface's header file. The
      ``RLM_ARRAY_TYPE()`` macro creates a protocol that allows you to
      tag :objc-sdk:`RLMArray <Classes/RLMArray.html>` with your type:

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ObjectModels.codeblock.array-declaration.m
         :language: objectivec

.. _ios-specify-an-optional-required-property:

Specify an Optional/Required Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      You can declare ``String``, ``Date``, ``Data``, and
      :swift-sdk:`ObjectId <Classes/ObjectId.html>` properties as
      optional or required (non-optional) using standard Swift syntax.
      Declare optional numeric types using the :swift-sdk:`RealmOptional
      <Classes/RealmOptional.html>` type.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ObjectModels.codeblock.optional-required-properties.swift
         :language: swift

      RealmOptional supports ``Int``, ``Float``, ``Double``, ``Bool``,
      and all of the sized versions of ``Int`` (``Int8``, ``Int16``,
      ``Int32``, ``Int64``).

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      To declare a given property as required, implement the
      :objc-sdk:`requiredProperties
      <Classes/RLMObject.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMObject(cm)requiredProperties>`
      method and return an array of required property names.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ObjectModels.codeblock.optional-required-properties.m
         :language: objectivec

.. _ios-realm-enum:

Work with Enums in Realm Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+service-short+} supports only ``Int``-backed ``@objc`` enums as properties of the
{+service-short+} object.

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ObjectModels.codeblock.realm-object-enum.swift
      :language: swift

.. seealso::

   :swift-sdk:`RealmEnum <Classes/Protocols.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A4EnumP>`

.. _ios-specify-a-primary-key:

Specify a Primary Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Primary keys enforce uniqueness among objects in a realm. 

You can efficiently find and update objects by primary key.

As long as an object is managed by a realm, that object's primary key
value is immutable.

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      Override :swift-sdk:`Object.primaryKey()
      <Extensions/Object.html#/c:@CM@RealmSwift@@objc(cs)RealmSwiftObject(cm)primaryKey>`
      to set the model’s primary key.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ObjectModels.codeblock.specify-a-primary-key.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      Override :objc-sdk:`+[RLMObject primaryKey]
      <Classes/RLMObject.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMObject(cm)primaryKey>` to
      set the model’s primary key.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ObjectModels.codeblock.specify-a-primary-key.m
         :language: objectivec


.. _ios-index-a-property:

Index a Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Indexes make queries using equality and IN operators faster in exchange
for slightly slower writes. Indexes take up more space in the realm
file. It’s best to only add indexes when optimizing the read performance
for specific situations.

Realm supports indexing for string, integer, boolean, ``Date``, and
``ObjectId`` properties.

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      To index a property, override
      :swift-sdk:`Object.indexedProperties()
      <Extensions/Object.html#/c:@CM@RealmSwift@@objc(cs)RealmSwiftObject(cm)indexedProperties>`
      and return a list of indexed property names.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ObjectModels.codeblock.index-a-property.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      To index a property, override :objc-sdk:`+[RLMObject
      indexedProperties]
      <Classes/RLMObject.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMObject(cm)indexedProperties>`
      and return a list of indexed property names.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ObjectModels.codeblock.index-a-property.m
         :language: objectivec

.. _ios-ignore-a-property:

Ignore a Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ignored properties behave exactly like normal properties. They can’t be
used in queries and won’t trigger Realm notifications. You can still
observe them using :apple:`KVO
<library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueObserving/KeyValueObserving.html>`.

.. tip::

   Realm automatically ignores read-only properties.

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      If you don’t want to save a field in your model to its realm,
      override :swift-sdk:`Object.ignoredProperties()
      <Extensions/Object.html#/c:@CM@RealmSwift@@objc(cs)RealmSwiftObject(cm)ignoredProperties>`
      and return a list of ignored property names.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ObjectModels.codeblock.ignore-a-property.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      If you don’t want to save a field in your model to its realm,
      override :objc-sdk:`+[RLMObject ignoredProperties]
      <Classes/RLMObject.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMObject(cm)ignoredProperties>`
      and return a list of ignored property names.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ObjectModels.codeblock.ignore-a-property.m

.. _ios-declare-relationship-properties:

Declare Relationship Properties
-------------------------------

.. _ios-define-a-to-one-relationship-property:

Define a To-One Relationship Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **to-one** relationship maps one property to a single instance of
another object type. For example, you can model a person having at most
one companion dog as a to-one relationship.

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Relationships.codeblock.to-one-relationship.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Relationships.codeblock.to-one-relationship.m
         :language: objectivec

.. _ios-define-a-to-many-relationship-property:

Define a To-Many Relationship Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **to-many** relationship maps one property to zero or more instances
of another object type. For example, you can model a person having any
number of companion dogs as a to-many relationship.

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      Use :swift-sdk:`List <Classes/List.html>` tagged with your target
      type to define your to-many relationship property.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Relationships.codeblock.to-many-relationship.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      Use :objc-sdk:`RLMArray <Classes/RLMArray.html>` tagged with your
      target type to define your to-many relationship property.

      .. tip::

         Remember to use the ``RLM_ARRAY_TYPE()`` macro with your type
         to :ref:`declare the RLMArray protocol for your type
         <ios-declare-a-property>`.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Relationships.codeblock.to-many-relationship.m
         :language: objectivec

.. _ios-define-an-inverse-relationship-property:

Define an Inverse Relationship Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An **inverse relationship** property is an automatic backlink
relationship. {+client-database+} automatically updates implicit
relationships whenever an object is added or removed in a corresponding
to-many list or to-one relationship property. You cannot manually set
the value of an inverse relationship property.

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      To define an inverse relationship, use :swift-sdk:`LinkingObjects
      <Structs/LinkingObjects.html>` in your object model. The
      ``LinkingObjects`` definition specifies the object type and
      property name of the relationship that it inverts.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Relationships.codeblock.inverse-relationship.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      To define an inverse relationship, use
      :objc-sdk:`RLMLinkingObjects
      <Classes.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMLinkingObjects>` in your object model.
      Override :objc-sdk:`+[RLMObject linkingObjectProperties]
      <Classes/RLMObject.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMObject(cm)linkingObjectsProperties>`
      method in your class to specify the object type and property name
      of the relationship that it inverts.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Relationships.codeblock.inverse-relationship.m
         :language: objectivec

.. _ios-define-an-embedded-object-property:

Define an Embedded Object Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An **embedded object** exists as nested data inside of a single,
specific parent object. It inherits the lifecycle of its parent object
and cannot exist as an independent Realm object. Realm automatically
deletes embedded objects if their parent object is deleted or when
overwritten by a new embedded object instance.

.. note:: Realm Uses Cascading Deletes for Embedded Objects
   
   When you delete a Realm object, any embedded objects referenced by
   that object are deleted with it. If you want the referenced objects
   to persist after the deletion of the parent object, your type should
   not be an embedded object at all. Use a regular :ref:`Realm object
   <ios-define-a-new-object-type>` with a :ref:`to-one relationship
   <ios-define-a-to-one-relationship-property>` instead.

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      You can define an embedded object by deriving from the
      :swift-sdk:`EmbeddedObject <Extensions/EmbeddedObject.html>`
      class. You can use your embedded object in another model as you
      would any other type.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/EmbeddedObjects.codeblock.models.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      You can define an embedded object by deriving from the
      :objc-sdk:`RLMEmbeddedObject
      <Classes/RLMEmbeddedObject.html>` class. You can use your
      embedded object in another model as you would any other type.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/EmbeddedObjects.codeblock.models.m

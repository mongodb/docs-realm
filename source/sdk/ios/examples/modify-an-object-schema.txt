Overview
--------

When you update your object schema, you must increment the schema version 
and perform a migration. 

If your schema update adds optional properties or removes properties, 
{+client-database+} can perform the migration automatically. You only need to 
increment the ``schemaVersion``. 

For more complex schema updates, you must also specify the migration logic 
in a ``migrationBlock``. This might include changes such as:

- Adding required properties that must be populated with default values
- Combining fields
- Renaming fields
- Converting from an object to an embedded object

Update a Schema Version
-----------------------

{+client-database+} can automatically migrate added and removed 
properties, but you must specify an updated schema version when you make 
these changes.

.. note::

   {+client-database+} does not automatically set values for new required 
   properties. You must use a migration block to set default values for
   new required properties. For new optional properties, existing records 
   can have null values. This means you don't need a migration block when 
   adding optional properties.

.. example::

   A {+realm+} using schema version ``1`` has a ``Person`` object type
   that has separate fields for first and last names, and an ``age`` field:

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Migrations.codeblock.model-v1.swift
            :language: swift

   The developer decides that the ``Person`` class does not need an ``age``
   field, but does need an ``email`` field.

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Migrations.codeblock.model-v1-updated.swift
            :language: swift

   {+client-database+} automatically migrates the {+realm+} to conform to 
   the updated ``Person`` schema. But the developer must set the {+realm+}'s 
   schema version to ``2``.

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Migrations.codeblock.update-schema-version.swift
            :language: swift
   
.. tip::

   SwiftUI developers may see an error that a migration is required when they
   add or remove properties. This is related to the lifecycle in SwiftUI.
   The Views are laid out, and then the ``.environment`` modifier sets the
   config.

   To resolve a migration error in these circumstances, pass 
   ``Realm.Configuration(schemaVersion: <Your Incremented Version>)`` 
   into the ``ObservedResults`` constructor.

.. _ios-perform-a-schema-migration:

Perform a Schema Migration
--------------------------

When the schema of an object changes, {+client-database+} requires a
migration for old instances of a given object to the new schema.

.. tip::

   You can use the :swift-sdk:`deleteRealmIfMigrationNeeded <Structs/Realm/Configuration.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V13ConfigurationV06deleteA17IfMigrationNeededSbvp>` 
   method to delete the {+realm+} if it would require a migration. This can
   be useful during development when you need to iterate quickly and don't
   want to perform the migration.

To define custom migration logic, set the :swift-sdk:`migrationBlock
<Structs/Realm/Configuration.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V13ConfigurationV14migrationBlockyAA9MigrationV_s6UInt64VtcSgvp>`
property of the :swift-sdk:`Configuration
<Structs/Realm/Configuration.html>` when :ref:`opening a realm
<ios-configure-and-open-a-realm>`.

The migration block receives a :swift-sdk:`Migration object
<Structs/Migration.html>` that you can use to perform the migration. You
can use the Migration object's :swift-sdk:`enumerateObjects(ofType:_:)
<Structs/Migration.html#/s:10RealmSwift9MigrationV16enumerateObjects6ofType_ySS_yAA13DynamicObjectCSg_AHtXEtF>`
method to iterate over and update all instances of a given
{+service-short+} type in the {+realm+}.

.. example::

   A {+realm+} using schema version ``1`` has a ``Person`` object type
   that has separate fields for first and last names:

   .. tabs-realm-languages::
   
      .. tab::
         :tabid: swift

         .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Migrations.codeblock.model-v1.swift
            :language: swift

      .. tab::
         :tabid: objective-c

         .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Migrations.codeblock.model-v1.m
            :language: objectivec


   The developer decides that the ``Person`` class should use a combined
   ``fullName`` field instead of the separate ``firstName`` and
   ``lastName`` fields. 

   To migrate the {+realm+} to conform to the updated ``Person`` schema,
   the developer sets the {+realm+}'s schema version to ``2`` and
   defines a migration function to set the value of ``fullName`` based
   on the existing ``firstName`` and ``lastName`` properties.

         :tabid: swift

         .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Migrations.codeblock.model-v2.swift
            :language: swift

         .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Migrations.codeblock.local-migration.swift
            :language: swift

      .. tab::
         :tabid: objective-c

         .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Migrations.codeblock.model-v2.m
            :language: objectivec

         .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Migrations.codeblock.local-migration.m
            :language: objectivec


.. tip:: Linear Migrations

   Avoid nesting ``if (oldSchemaVersion < X)`` statements in migration
   blocks. This ensures that users see all upgrades, no matter which
   schema version they start from.

.. _ios-rename-a-property:

Rename a Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To rename a property during a migration, use the
:swift-sdk:`Migration.renameProperty(onType:from:to:)
<Structs/Migration.html#/s:10RealmSwift9MigrationV14renameProperty6onType4from2toySS_S2StF>`
method. 

{+client-database+} applies any new nullability or indexing settings
during the rename operation.

.. _ios-convert-to-an-embedded-object:

Convert from Object to EmbeddedObject
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Embedded objects <ios-embedded-objects>` cannot exist
independently of a parent object. When changing an Object to an
EmbeddedObject, the migration block must ensure that every embedded
object has exactly one backlink to a parent object. Having no backlinks
or multiple backlinks raises the following exceptions:

.. code-block::
   :copyable: False

   At least one object does not have a backlink (data would get lost).

.. code-block::
   :copyable: False

   At least one object does have multiple backlinks.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`ios-embedded-objects`

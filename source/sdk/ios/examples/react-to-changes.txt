.. _ios-register-a-realm-change-listener:

Register a Realm Change Listener
--------------------------------

You can register a notification handler on an entire :ref:`{+realm+}
<ios-realms>`. {+client-database+} calls the notification
handler whenever any write transaction involving that Realm is
committed. The handler receives no information about the change.

.. _ios-register-a-collection-change-listener:

Register a Collection Change Listener
-------------------------------------

You can register a notification handler on a collection within a
{+realm+}.

Realm Database notifies your handler:

- After first retrieving the collection.
- Whenever a write transaction adds, changes, or removes objects in the collection.

Notifications describe the changes since the prior notification with
three lists of indices: the indices of the objects that were deleted,
inserted, and modified.

.. important:: Order Matters
   
   In collection notification handlers, always apply changes
   in the following order: deletions, insertions, then
   modifications. Handling insertions before deletions may
   result in unexpected behavior.

.. _ios-register-an-object-change-listener:

Register an Object Change Listener
----------------------------------

You can register a notification handler on a specific object
within a Realm. Realm Database notifies your handler:

- When the object is deleted.
- When any of the object's properties change.

The handler receives information about what fields changed
and whether the object was deleted.

Write Silently
--------------

You can write to a {+realm+} *without* sending a notification to a
specific observer by passing the observer's notification token in an
array to :swift-sdk:`realm.write(withoutNotifying:_:)

.. _stop-watching-for-changes:

Stop Watching for Changes
-------------------------

Observation stops when the token returned by an ``observe`` call becomes
invalid. You can explicitly invalidate a token by calling its
``invalidate()`` method.

.. important:: Retain Tokens as Long as You Want to Observe

   Notifications stop if the token is in a local variable that goes out
   of scope.

.. _ios-key-value-observation:

Key-value Observation
---------------------

Key-value Observation Compliance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+client-database+} objects are :apple:`key-value observing (KVO) 
compliant<documentation/swift/cocoa_design_patterns/using_key-value_observing_in_swift>` 
for most properties:

- Almost all managed (non-ignored) properties on ``Object`` subclasses 
- The ``invalidated`` property on ``Object`` and ``List``

You cannot observe ``LinkingObjects`` properties via Key-value observation.

.. important::

   You cannot add an object to a {+realm+} (with ``realm.add(obj)`` or similar 
   methods) while it has any registered observers.

Managed vs. Unmanaged KVO Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Observing the properties of unmanaged instances of ``Object`` subclasses 
works like any other dynamic property.

Observing the properties of managed objects works differently. With 
{+realm+}-managed objects, the value of a property may change when:

- You assign to it
- You call ``realm.refresh()``
- The {+realm+} is automatically refreshed after a write transaction 
  occurs on a different thread
- You call ``realm.beginWrite()`` after changes to a different thread which 
  have not been picked up by a refresh on the current thread

{+backend-short+} applies changes made in the write transaction(s) on other threads 
at once. Observers see Key-value observation notifications at once. 
Intermediate steps do not trigger KVO notifications.

.. example::

   Say your app performs a write transaction that increments a property 
   from 1 to 10. On the main thread, you get a single notification of a 
   change directly from 1 to 10. You won't get notifications for every 
   incremental change between 1 and 10.

Avoid modifying managed Realm objects from within 
``observeValueForKeyPath(_:ofObject:change:context:)``. Property values 
can change when not in a write transaction, or as part of beginning a 
write transaction.

Observing Realm Lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Observing changes made to {+service-short+} ``List`` properties is simpler than 
``NSMutableArray`` properties:

- You don't have to mark ``List`` properties as dynamic to observe them.
- You can call modification methods on ``List`` directly. Anyone observing 
  the property that stores it gets a notification.

You don't need to use ``mutableArrayValueForKey(_:)``, although {+realm+} 
does support this for code compatibility.

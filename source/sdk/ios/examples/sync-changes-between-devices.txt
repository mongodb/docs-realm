Open a Synced Realm
-------------------

When you use {+sync+}, there are a few different flows you could use to 
open a {+realm+}. You'll need:

- A logged-in user
- A network connection, if opening a realm with ``asyncOpen``
- A local copy of the synced {+realm+}, if you want to enable offline use
  of the {+realm+}

You can work with synced {+realms+} offline if the user credentials are
cached and you use {+backend-short+} initializers to open the {+realms+}.
However, this requires that the user has had an active network connection 
previously to login and download a local copy of the synced {+realm+}.

If you want to enable a new user to start completely offline, having 
never logged in, you'd need to start with a :ref:`local {+client-database+} 
<ios-open-a-local-realm>`, and then write logic in your app to copy that 
over to a synced {+realm+} after you log in the user.

.. important::

   {+sync+} does not currently support watchOS.

Open a Synced Realm for the First Time
--------------------------------------

Authenticate a User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first time a user opens a {+realm+}, you'll need to log the user in
and download a {+realm+} before opening it.

Upon this initial login, we cache login credentials, so you can open new 
{+realms+} after checking for a logged-in user.

      :swift-sdk:`Realm.asyncOpen(configuration:)

      only the latest changes since the {+realm+} last synced with the {+app+}.
      
      A common pattern is to use ``asyncOpen`` during a login flow, but use 
      ``init`` to open a {+realm+} on subsequent opens.

Open a Synced Realm that has Previously Been Synced
---------------------------------------------------

After you have authenticated a user and downloaded a synced {+realm+},
you can open the same {+realm+} again without re-authenticating. We cache
credentials until you :swift-sdk:`logout the user <Extensions/User.html#/s:So7RLMUserC10RealmSwiftE6logOut7Combine6FutureCyyts5Error_pGyF>`, 
or :ref:`perform a client reset <ios-client-reset>`. 

With a synced {+realm+} on the device and a previously logged-in user, you
can choose to open the synced {+realm+} in two ways:

- :ref:`Open a synced {+realm+} with local data <ios-open-synced-realm-with-local-data>` 
  immediately. This works regardless of network status, and enables the 
  user to start working with the {+realm+} without waiting for changes to 
  download from the server. However, data that is on the device may be stale. 
  Additionally, this may result in behavior that seems unexpected or surprising 
  to the user. Data that has synced in the background may appear "suddenly" 
  after the user has already begun working with the {+realm+}. You'll need to 
  account for this in your UI logic.
- :ref:`Open a synced {+realm+} from the server <ios-open-synced-realm-from-server>`. 
  This requires the user to have a network connection, so you should 
  :ref:`check the network connection <ios-check-network-connection>` before 
  attempting to open the {+realm+} from the server. This method of opening the 
  {+realm+} ensures that the user always has the most up-to-date data from the 
  server, at the cost of an upfront pause while loading, and being unable to 
  use the {+realm+} offline.

.. _ios-open-synced-realm-with-local-data:

Open a Synced Realm with Local Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   A synced {+realm+} is not interchangeable with a local {+client-database+}.
   If you want to sync a local {+client-database+}, you'll need to copy the
   content from the local {+realm+} to a synced {+realm+}. A local {+realm+}
   lives only on the device and never attempts to sync with the server. A
   synced {+realm+} contains additional {+sync-short+}-related metadata, and
   consistently and persistently attempts to connect and sync data with the 
   server.

      :swift-sdk:`Realm() <Structs/Realm.html>` initializers. This opens 
      the {+realm+} immediately, before downloading changesets from the server.
      This works if the device is offline, but may lead to temporary data
      inconsistencies while your app downloads any new remote data. The 
      {+realm+} will update from the server in the background.

.. _init-vs-async-open:

Decide How to Open the Realm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When choosing between ``init`` and ``asyncOpen`` to open the {+realm+}, 
consider these factors:
 
- When you use ``asyncOpen``, the app attempts to download an up-to-date 
  {+realm+} before opening it. The user must wait to access the data and 
  interact with the app. After this download completes, the user has the 
  most current version of the data.

- When you open a {+realm+} with ``init``, the file opens immediately. 
  The app contains stale data - whatever was available the last time the 
  file was open. The user can access that data and interact with the app 
  right away, while updated data syncs in the background.

Which method to choose depends on how important it is for your app to have 
the most current version of data. 

Consider the example of a note-taking app. You might decide it's most 
important for your user to be able to quickly jot down a note. The user 
shouldn't have to wait while downloading changes that a family member made 
to a shared note. In this case, opening a {+realm+} with ``init`` gets the 
user to the UI right away.

In a game, though, it might be most important for a user to have current 
data. Say a user plays the game on both an iPad and an iPhone. The user 
progresses three levels on the iPad. Later, the user opens the game on an 
iPhone. In this case, ``asyncOpen`` is a better way to open the {+realm+}. 
Loading with stale data might get the user into the game faster, but three 
levels behind.

A common pattern is to open a {+realm+} with ``asyncOpen`` in the login flow, 
and then use ``init`` for subsequent opens. If you want users to only interact 
with the most up-to-date version of your data, you can exclusively use 
``asyncOpen``. This incurs the cost of additional loading time and prevents 
users from opening a realm while offline.

.. tip::

   When you use ``asyncOpen``, you should first :ref:`check for a network connection 
   <ios-check-network-connection>`. If the app is offline, ``asyncOpen``
   leaves your app waiting forever.


.. _ios-sync-changes-in-the-background:

Sync Changes in the Background
------------------------------

If you want your app to update data in the background (while the app is
minimized), iOS requires you to implement :apple:`Background App Refresh
<documentation/uikit/app_and_environment/scenes/preparing_your_ui_to_run_in_the_background/updating_your_app_with_background_app_refresh>`.
Enabling Background App Refresh minimizes the time it takes for the user
to see the most recent data; without Background App Refresh, {+service+}
updates the data when the user launches the app, potentially resulting
in noticeable lag.

To use the {+realm+} while the device is locked, you must adjust the
file protection settings. See
:ref:`use-realm-when-the-device-is-locked`.

.. _ios-suspend-or-resume-a-sync-session:

Suspend or Resume a Sync Session
--------------------------------

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      You can suspend or resume a sync session using the
      :swift-sdk:`SyncSession <Extensions/SyncSession.html>` instance of
      a synced {+realm+}.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Sync.codeblock.pause-resume-sync-session.swift

.. _ios-check-sync-progress:

Check Upload & Download Progress for a Sync Session
---------------------------------------------------

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      You can add a progress notification using the synced {+realm+}'s
      SyncSession instance's
      :swift-sdk:`addProgressNotification(for:mode:block:)
      <Extensions/SyncSession.html#/s:So14RLMSyncSessionC10RealmSwiftE23addProgressNotification3for4mode5blockSo011RLMProgressG5TokenCSgAbCE0F9DirectionO_AbCE0F4ModeOyAbCE0F0VctF>`
      method.

      This method returns a token that you should retain until you wish
      to stop observing upload or download progress. Note that if you
      keep the token in a local variable, observation will stop when the
      local variable goes out of scope.

      method.

      This method returns a token that you should retain until you wish

.. _ios-check-network-connection:

Check the Network Connection
----------------------------

.. tip:: 

   {+service+}'s *offline-first* design means that you generally don't
   need to check the current network connection state. That said, the
   ``connectionState`` property is available if your app calls for some
   indication of connection state.

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      To check the connection state, you can read the synced {+realm+}'s
      SyncSession instance's :swift-sdk:`connectionState
      <Extensions/SyncSession.html#/s:So14RLMSyncSessionC10RealmSwiftE15ConnectionStatea>`
      property directly. 

      This property is :apple:`KVO-compliant
      <library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueObserving/KeyValueObserving.html>`,
      so you can observe changes using KVO or even Combine.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Sync.codeblock.check-network-connection.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      To check the connection state, you can read the synced {+realm+}'s
      RLMSyncSession instance's :objc-sdk:`connectionState
      <Classes/RLMSyncSession.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMSyncSession(py)connectionState>`
      property directly.

      This property is :apple:`KVO-compliant
      <library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueObserving/KeyValueObserving.html>`,
      so you can observe changes using KVO. The following example
      demonstrates how to implement an observer class:

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Sync.codeblock.check-network-connection-setup.m
         :language: objectivec

      You can then attach an observer instance to the RLMSyncSession
      object. Be sure to remove the observer when finished.

.. _ios-handle-sync-errors:

Handle Sync Errors
------------------

While developing an application that uses {+sync+}, you should set an error
handler. This error handler will detect and respond to any failed sync-related
API calls. 

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      Set an error handler on the :swift-sdk:`SyncManager

      handler on the SyncManager singleton. When an error occurs, the iOS SDK
      calls the error handler with the error object and the :swift-sdk:`SyncSession
      <Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V11syncSessionSo07RLMSyncD0CSgvp>` that the
      error occurred on.
      
      .. note::

.. _ios-delete-a-client-realm-file:

Delete a Client Realm File
--------------------------

In some cases, you may want to completely delete a realm file from disk.

Realm avoids copying data into memory except when absolutely required.
As a result, all objects managed by a realm have references to the file
on disk. Before you can safely delete the file, you must ensure the
deallocation of these objects:

- All objects read from or added to the realm
- All List and Results objects
- All ThreadSafeReference objects
- The realm itself

In practice, there are two safe times to delete the realm file:

1. On application startup before ever opening the realm.
#. After only having opened the realm within an explicit ``autorelease`` pool, which ensures deallocation of all of objects within it.

.. tabs-realm-languages::

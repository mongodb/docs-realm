Call a Function by Name
-----------------------

Consider a :ref:`Realm function <functions>` named ``sum`` that takes
two arguments, adds them, and returns the result:

.. code-block:: javascript

   // sum: adds two numbers
   exports = function(a, b) {
     return a + b;
   };

To execute a function from the iOS Client SDK, use the ``functions``
object on the currently logged-in user.

The ``functions`` object has dynamic members corresponding to functions.
In this case, ``functions.sum()`` refers to the ``sum`` function. Pass a
``BSONArray`` of arguments. The trailing closure is the completion
handler to call when the function call is complete. This handler is
executed on a non-main global `DispatchQueue`.

Overview
--------


This page contains information to integrate Realm into your
Electron application quickly. To learn how to set up an Electron
application with Realm without using any additional frameworks, see the
:ref:`Electron set up <electron-setup>` instructions. If you have
already created an application using `Create React App
<https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html>`_ or are
interested in integrating a React App with Realm using Electron, check
out the :ref:`Electron with React set up <node-electron-cra-client-quick-start>`
instructions.

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- :ref:`Created an App <create-a-realm-app>`
- :ref:`Enabled Device Sync <enable-sync>`

.. note:: Version Requirement

   Realm works with any of the officially supported Electron
   versions. We recommend using the latest stable release. To see the
   officially supported Electron versions, check out the `Electron
   Releases <https://www.electronjs.org/releases/>`_ document.

Open a Realm
------------

Authenticate a user, define a schema, and :ref:`sync enabled Device Sync
<enable-sync>`, then call :js-sdk:`Realm.open() <Realm.html#.open>` in your
renderer.js file.

Once you have opened the realm, you can :ref:`write to the realm
<node-realm-database-writes>`.

   const app = new Realm.App({ id: "<Your App ID>" }); // create a new instance of the Realm.App
   async function run() {

     // login with an anonymous credential
     await app.logIn(Realm.Credentials.anonymous());

     const DogSchema = {
         name: "Dog",
         properties: {
           _id: 'int',
           name: "string",
           age: "int",
         },
         primaryKey: '_id'
     };

     const realm = await Realm.open({
       schema: [DogSchema],
       sync: {
         user: app.currentUser,
         partitionValue: "myPartition",
       },
     });
     
     // The myPartition realm is now synced to the device. You can
     // access it through the `realm` object returned by `Realm.open()`

     // write to the realm
   }
   run().catch(err => {
     console.error("Failed to open realm:", err)
   });

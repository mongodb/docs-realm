Realms are the core data structure used to organize data in Realm Database. At
its core, a realm is a collection of the objects that you use in your
application, called Realm objects, as well as additional metadata that describe
the objects.

.. _node-realm-file:

Realm Files
-----------

Realm Database stores a binary encoded version of every object and type in a
realm in a single ``.realm`` file. The file is located at a specific path that
you define when you open the realm.

.. tip:: Implement Compacting in Your Production Application

   Every production application should implement a ``shouldCompactOnLaunch`` 
   callback to periodically reduce the realm file size.

.. note:: Auxiliary Realm Files
   
   Realm Database creates additional files for each realm.
   To learn more about these files, see :ref:`Realm Database Internals
   <node-realm-database>`.

.. warning:: Use Caution When Deleting Realm Files
   
   In some circumstances, such as a client reset scenario, you might need to
   delete a realm file and its auxiliary files.
   
   If you delete a realm file or any of its auxiliary files while one or
   more instances of the realm are open, you might corrupt the realm or
   disrupt :ref:`sync <sync>`.
   
   You may safely delete these files when all instances of a realm are
   closed. Before you delete a realm file, make sure that you back up any
   important objects as you will lose all unsynced data in the realm.

.. _node-in-memory-realm:

In-Memory Realms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also open a realm entirely in memory, which will not create a ``.realm``
file or its associated auxiliary files. Instead the SDK stores objects in memory
while the realm is open and discards them immediately when all instances are
closed.

Copy Data and Open a New Realm
------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 10.14.0

To copy data from an existing realm to a new realm with different
configuration options, pass the new configuration the
:js-sdk:`Realm.writeCopyTo() <Realm.html#writeCopyTo>` method.

In the new realm's configuration, you *must* specify the ``path``. 

If you write the copied realm to a realm file that already exists, the data is written object by object.
The copy operation replaces objects if there already exists objects for given primary keys.
The schemas of the realm you copy and the realm you are writing to must be 
compatible for the copy operation to succeed.
Only objects in the schemas of both configurations are copied over.

The configuration change can include modifications to :js-sdk:`SyncConfiguration
<Realm.App.Sync.html#~SyncConfiguration>`: 

- Local realm to synced realm
- Synced Realm to local realm
- Synced Realm to a Synced Realm for a different user

.. include:: /includes/note-writecopy-local-to-sync.rst

.. include:: /includes/note-writecopy-same-type-sync-only.rst

The configuration change can also include changes to ``encryptionKey`` 
property of the ``Configuration``: 

- Encrypted realm to unencrypted realm
- Unencrypted realm to encrypted realm

.. example:: Convert Local Realm to Synced Realm

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/open-and-close-a-realm.snippet.open-local-as-synced.js
      :language: javascript
      :emphasize-lines: 15-16

You can also combine changes to configuration. For example, you can open a
local encrypted realm as a synced unencrypted realm or a unencrypted synced realm
as an encrypted synced realm.

.. example:: Convert Synced Encrypted to Local Unencrypted Realm

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/open-and-close-a-realm.snippet.sync-encrypted-to-local-unencrypted.js

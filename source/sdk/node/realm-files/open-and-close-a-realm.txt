Open a Local Realm

Open a Realm Without Providing a Schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After a realm has been created on a device, you don't need to always pass in a
schema to access the realm. Instead, you can call ``new Realm()`` with
no arguments. The realm's schema is derived from the existing realm file at
``Realm.defaultPath``.

Accessing a realm without providing a schema only works for local realms. You
must always pass a schema when using a Synced realm.

Copy Data and Open a New Realm
------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 10.14.0

To copy data from an existing realm to a new realm with different
configuration options, pass the new configuration the
:js-sdk:`Realm.writeCopyTo() <Realm.html#writeCopyTo>` method.

In the new realm's configuration, you *must* specify the ``path``. 

If you write the copied realm to a realm file that already exists, the data is written object by object.
The copy operation replaces objects if there already exists objects for given primary keys.
The schemas of the realm you copy and the realm you are writing to must be 
compatible for the copy operation to succeed.
Only objects in the schemas of both configurations are copied over.

The configuration change can include modifications to :js-sdk:`SyncConfiguration
<Realm.App.Sync.html#~SyncConfiguration>`: 

- Local realm to synced realm
- Synced Realm to local realm
- Synced Realm to a Synced Realm for a different user

.. include:: /includes/note-writecopy-local-to-sync.rst

.. include:: /includes/note-writecopy-same-type-sync-only.rst

The configuration change can also include changes to ``encryptionKey`` 
property of the ``Configuration``: 

- Encrypted realm to unencrypted realm
- Unencrypted realm to encrypted realm

.. example:: Convert Local Realm to Synced Realm

      :language: javascript
      :emphasize-lines: 15-16

You can also combine changes to configuration. For example, you can open a
local encrypted realm as a synced unencrypted realm or a unencrypted synced realm
as an encrypted synced realm.

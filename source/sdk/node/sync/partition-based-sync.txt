Atlas Device Sync has two sync modes:  :ref:`Flexible Sync <flexible-sync>`
and the older Partition-Based Sync. We recommend using Flexible Sync.
The information on this page is for users who would still like to
use Parition-Based Sync to build their Node.js app. For information
about Partition-Based Sync, refer to :ref:`Partition-Based Sync <partition-based-sync>`.

.. note:: Matching Sync Modes with Atlas Device Sync
    When you use :ref:`Atlas Device Sync <sync>` in your client application, your
    implementation must match the Sync Mode you select in your backend App configuration.
    You can only use one Sync mode for your application. You cannot mix Parition-Based
    Sync and Flexible Sync within the same app.

You can open a Synced realm with a Flexible Sync or Partition-Based Sync. For information
about opening a Flexible Synced realm, refer to :ref:`Configure & Open a Synced Realm –
Node.js SDK <node-open-a-synced-realm>`. If you have not yet decided or are unsure which
to use, refer to :ref:`Choose Your Sync Mode <sync-modes>`.

    You can open a realm immediately with background sync or after a timeout elapses using
    Partition-Based Sync. 

Open a Bundled Partition-Based Synced Realm
-------------------------------------------

When opening a :ref:`bundled synchronized realm <node-bundle-a-realm>` that uses Partition-Based Sync,
you must use the same partition key that was used in the original realm configuration. If you use a
different partition key, the SDK throw an error when opening the bundled realm.

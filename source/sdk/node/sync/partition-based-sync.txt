Atlas Device Sync has two sync modes:  :ref:`Flexible Sync <flexible-sync>`
and Partition-Based Sync. We recommend using Flexible Sync.
The information on this page is to support users who have existing apps that use
:ref:`Partition-Based Sync <partition-based-sync>`.

.. note:: Matching Sync Modes with Atlas Device Sync

  When you use :ref:`Atlas Device Sync <sync>` in your client application, your
  implementation must match the Sync Mode you select in your backend App configuration.
  You can only use one Sync mode for your application. You cannot mix Partition-Based
  Sync and Flexible Sync within the same app.

    You can open a realm immediately with background sync or after a timeout elapses using
    Partition-Based Sync. 

Open a Bundled Partition-Based Synced Realm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When opening a :ref:`bundled synchronized realm <node-bundle-a-realm>` that uses Partition-Based Sync,
you must use the same partition key that was used in the original realm configuration. If you use a
different partition key, the SDK throw an error when opening the bundled realm.

Overview
--------

The Realm Node.js SDK enables development of applications using the
JavaScript and `TypeScript <https://www.typescriptlang.org/>`__ languages.
Realm on Node.js is best suited for writing server-side applications. Your
Node.js application could be one component in a wider stack that also includes
iOS and Android apps.

The Realm Node.js SDK is not suitable for front-end application
development.

- Due to limitations of the browser environment, it is not possible to build a
  browser-based web app with this SDK. For front-end web applications, use the
  Realm :ref:`Web SDK <web-intro>`.

- For cross-platform mobile app development, use the Realm :ref:`React Native SDK <react-native-install>`.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before getting started, ensure your environment meets the
following prerequisites:

- `Node.js <https://nodejs.org/en/>`__ version 12.x or later (including Node.js version 14) 
- Linux, macOS 10.8 (or later), or Windows 8 (or later)

Installation
------------

Follow these steps to create a Node.js project and add the
Realm Node.js SDK to it.

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Create a Node.js Project


      Create your Node.js project by creating a new directory
      for your project and running ``npm init`` in that
      directory. In the example below, replace ``MyRealmApp``
      with your desired project name. Answer all of the prompts
      to fill out the details of your project.

      .. code-block:: bash

         mkdir MyRealmApp && cd MyRealmApp && npm init


   .. step:: Install Realm with NPM


      In your Node.js project directory, use the following command
      to add Realm to your project:

      .. code-block:: bash

         npm install realm


   .. step:: Enable TypeScript (optional)


      TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static
      type checking and other features intended to make
      application-scale development more robust. If you'd like
      to use TypeScript, follow the TypeScript team's official
      `Node Starter guide
      <https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Node-Starter#typescript--node>`__.
      Realm supports TypeScript natively and integrates easily
      into a TypeScript project.


IoT Installation
----------------

To create a Node.js project and add the Realm Node.js SDK on an
Internet of Things (IoT) platform such as the Raspberry Pi 2, 3, or 4
running Raspberry Pi OS (formerly Raspbian), follow the steps below:

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Install a C++ Compiler


      The Realm IoT SDK is not distributed as a binary, so you must build
      it from source. To do this, you'll need a working C++ compiler. To
      install such a compiler on your IoT device, run the following command:

      .. code-block:: bash

         sudo apt install build-essential g++ libssl-dev


   .. step:: Create a Node.js Project


      Create your Node.js project by creating a new directory
      for your project and running ``npm init`` in that
      directory. In the example below, replace ``MyRealmApp``
      with your desired project name. Answer all of the prompts
      to fill out the details of your project.

      .. code-block:: bash

         mkdir MyRealmApp && cd MyRealmApp && npm init


   .. step:: Install Realm with NPM


      In your Node.js project directory, use the following command
      to add Realm to your project:

      .. code-block:: bash

         npm install realm


   .. step:: Enable TypeScript (optional)


      TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static
      type checking and other features intended to make
      application-scale development more robust. If you'd like
      to use TypeScript, follow the TypeScript team's official
      `Node Starter guide
      <https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Node-Starter#typescript--node>`__.
      Realm supports TypeScript natively and integrates easily
      into a TypeScript project.

Import Realm
------------

Add the following line to the top of your source files (JavaScript or TypeScript) where
you want to use Realm:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/quickstart.snippet.import-realm.js
   :language: javascript

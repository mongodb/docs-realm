Schema Version
--------------

A **schema version** identifies the state of a :ref:`{+backend-schema+}
<node-realm-schema>` at some point in time. {+client-database+} tracks the schema
version of each {+realm+} and uses it to map the objects in each {+realm+}
to the correct schema.

Schema versions are ascending integers that you can optionally include
in the {+realm+} configuration when you open a {+realm+}. If a client
application does not specify a version number when it opens a {+realm+} then
the {+realm+} defaults to version ``0``.

.. important:: Increment Versions Monotonically
   
   :ref:`Migrations <node-client-migrations>` must update a {+realm+} to a
   higher schema version. {+client-database+} will throw an error if a client
   application opens a {+realm+} with a schema version that is lower than
   the {+realm+}'s current version or if the specified schema version is the
   same as the {+realm+}'s current version but includes different
   :ref:`object schemas <node-object-schema>`.

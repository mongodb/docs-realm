The Node.js SDK memory maps objects in a :ref:`realm <node-realms>` directly to
JavaScript objects, called **Realm objects**. For the most part Realm objects
work just like common JavaScript objects, but they also bring along a few
additional features.

This means that you can store just about any JavaScript object in a realm and


.. _node-object-schema:

Object Types & Schemas
----------------------

An **object type** defines and configures the properties and relationships of
any {+service-short+} objects that conform to the type.

An **object schema** is a configuration object that defines the structure of an
object type. A schema can also define default values and indexes for any
property.

specify a primary key, 

For every property in an object type, the schema defines:

- a specific data type
- whether the property has a single value or a list of values
- whether the property is required or optional

Schemas can also define :ref:`relationships <node-client-relationships>` between
object types in a {+realm+}.

{+service+} guarantees that all objects in a {+realm+} conform to the
schema for their object type and validates objects whenever they're
created, modified, or deleted.

.. _node-primary-key:

Primary Keys
------------

A **primary key** is a string or integer property that uniquely identifies an
object. You may optionally define a primary key for an object type as part of
the :ref:`object schema <node-object-schema>`. {+client-database+} automatically
indexes primary key properties, which allows you to efficiently read and modify
objects based on their primary key.

If an object type has a primary key, then all objects of that type must include
the primary key property with a value that is unique among objects of the same
type in a {+realm+}. You cannot change the primary key property for an object
type after any object of that type is added to a {+realm+}.

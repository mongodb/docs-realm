A write transaction is a function that can modify the state of objects in a
given realm. Write transactions let you create, modify, or delete Realm objects
and can encapsulate multiple operations into a single, idempotent update. In
other words a transaction is *all or nothing*: either all of the operations in
the transaction succeed or, if any operation fails, none of the operations in
the transaction take effect.

.. important::
   
   Every write operation must occur in a write transaction.

.. example::
   
   Write transactions are callback functions that you pass to a {+realm+}
   instance to modify objects in that realm. For examples of specific write
   operations, see :ref:`node-write-operations`.
   
   .. code-block:: javascript
      
      const realm = await Realm.open();
      realm.write(() => {
        const tesla = realm.create("Car", {
          make: "Tesla",
          model: "Model S",
          year: 2020,
          miles: 12000
        })
        const honda = realm.create("Car", {
          make: "Honda",
          model: "Civic",
          year: 2018,
          miles: 30000
        })
      })

Transaction Lifecycle
---------------------

A given {+realm+} only processes one write transaction at a time. When a
{+realm+} receives a write transaction, it adds the transaction to a queue and
evaluates each transaction individually in the order they arrived.

After processing a transaction, {+client-database+} either **commits** it or
**cancels** it:

- {+client-database+} applies all operations in a **committed** transaction to
  the realm. Once applied, Realm automatically updates :ref:`live queries
  <node-live-queries>` and calls any notification listeners that refer to
  created, modified, and deleted objects.
  
  .. note::
     
     In :term:`synced {+realms+} <{+sync+}>`, {+client-database+} also queues
     the change to be sent to :term:`{+service+}` whenever a network is
     available.

- {+client-database+} does not apply any operations in a **cancelled**
  transaction to the {+realm+}. Realm cancels a transaction if any operation in
  the transaction is invalid or fails.

.. _node-acid-compliance:

Realm is ACID Compliant
-----------------------

Write transactions provide :term:`ACID` guarantees, which ensure that all
committed write operations are valid and that readers don't see transient or
inconsistent states.

- :wikipedia:`Atomicity <Atomicity_(database_systems)>`: Realm groups operations in
  transactions and rolls back all operations in a transaction if any of them
  fail.

- :wikipedia:`Consistency <Consistency_(database_systems)>`: Realm avoids invalid
  data by validating changes to each object against its schema. If the result of
  any write operation is not valid, {+client-database+} cancels and rolls back
  the entire transaction.

- :wikipedia:`Isolation <Isolation_(database_systems)>`: Realm maintains a write
  queue and applies only one write transaction at a time. This ensures thread
  safety between transactions.

- :wikipedia:`Durability <Durability_(database_systems)>`: Realm writes
  operations to disk immediately after committing a transaction. In the event of
  an app crash, for example, the changes are not lost or corrupted.

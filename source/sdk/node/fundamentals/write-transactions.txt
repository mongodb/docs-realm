A write transaction is a function that modifies objects in a realm. Write 
transactions let you create, modify, or delete Realm objects. They handle 
operations in a single, idempotent update. A transaction is 
*all or nothing*. Either:

- All the operations in the transaction succeed, or; 
- If any operation fails, none of the operations complete.

.. important::
   
   Every write operation must occur in a write transaction.

.. example::
   
   Write transactions are callback functions that you pass to a realm
   instance. For examples of specific write operations, see 
   :ref:`node-write-operations`.
   
   .. code-block:: javascript
      
      const realm = await Realm.open();
      realm.write(() => {
        const tesla = realm.create("Car", {
          make: "Tesla",
          model: "Model S",
          year: 2020,
          miles: 12000
        })
        const honda = realm.create("Car", {
          make: "Honda",
          model: "Civic",
          year: 2018,
          miles: 30000
        })
      })

Transaction Lifecycle
---------------------

A given realm only processes one write transaction at a time. When you 
make a write transaction, the realm adds the transaction to a queue. The 
realm evaluates each transaction in the order it arrived.

After processing a transaction, Realm Database either **commits** it or
**cancels** it:

- After a **commit**, the realm applies all operations in the transaction. 
  Once applied, the realm automatically updates :ref:`live queries
  <node-live-queries>`. It notifies listeners of created, modified, and 
  deleted objects.
  
  .. note::
     
     When using :ref:`Sync <sync>`, Realm also queues
     the changes to send to :term:`Realm`. Realm sends 
     these changes when a network is available.

- Realm Database does not apply any operations in a **cancelled**
  transaction. Realm Database cancels a transaction if an operation 
  fails or is invalid.

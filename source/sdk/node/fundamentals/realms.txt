Realms are the core data structure used to organize data in Realm Database. At
its core, a realm is a collection of the objects that you use in your
application, called Realm objects, as well as additional metadata that describe
the objects.

   See :ref:`Open & Close a Realm <node-open-close-realm>` for code
   examples that show how to configure and open a realm in the Node.js SDK.

Realm vs Other Databases
------------------------

The Realm data model is similar to both relational and document
databases but has distinct differences from both. To underscore these
differences, it's helpful to highlight what a realm **is not**:

A realm is not a single, application-wide database.
    Applications based on other database systems generally store all of their
    data in a single database. Apps often split data across multiple
    realms to organize data more efficiently and to enforce access controls.

A realm is not a relational table.
    Normalized tables in relational databases only store one type of
    information, such as street addresses or items in a store inventory. A
    realm can contain any number of object types that are relevant to a
    given domain.

A realm is not a collection of schemaless documents.
    Document databases don't necessarily enforce a strict schema for the data in
    each collection. While similar to documents in form, every Realm object
    conforms to a schema for a specific object type in the realm. An object
    cannot contain a property that is not described by its schema.

Object Types & Schemas
----------------------

Every Realm object conforms to a specific **object type**, which is essentially
a class that defines the properties and :ref:`relationships
<node-client-relationships>` for objects of that type using a pre-defined
schema. Realm guarantees that all objects in a realm conform to
the schema for their object type and validates objects whenever they're created,
modified, or deleted.

Realm objects are fundamentally similar to a common JavaScript object but they
also bring along a few additional features like schema validation and :ref:`live
queries <node-live-queries>`. The Node.js SDK memory maps Realm objects directly
to native JavaScript objects, which means there's no need to use a special data
access library, such as an :wikipedia:`ORM <Object-relational_mapping>`.
Instead, you can work with Realm objects as you would any other object.

The following class contains a schema that defines a ``Car`` object type with 
id, make, model, and miles properties. It also defines a primary key.

   :language: javascript

.. tip:: Learn How to Define an Object Schema
   
   For code examples that show how to define a Realm object schema in the
   Node.js SDK, see :ref:`Define a Realm Object Schema
   <node-define-a-realm-object-schema>`.

.. _node-realm-schema:

Realm Schema
------------

A **realm schema** is a list of valid :ref:`object schemas
<node-object-schemas>` that a realm may contain. Every Realm object must conform
to an object type that's included in its realm's schema.

If a realm already contains data when you open it, Realm Database
validates each object to ensure that an object schema was provided for its type
and that it meets all of the constraints specified in the schema.

A realm that contains basic data about cars and manufacturers might use a
schema like the following:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/define-a-realm-object-schema.snippet.define-one-to-many.js
   :language: javascript

.. _node-realm-file:

Realm Files
-----------

Realm Database stores a binary encoded version of every object and type in a
realm in a single ``.realm`` file. The file is located at a specific path that
you define when you open the realm.

.. tip:: Implement Compacting in Your Production Application

   Every production application should implement a ``shouldCompactOnLaunch`` 
   callback to periodically reduce the realm file size.

.. note:: Auxiliary Realm Files
   
   Realm Database creates additional files for each realm.
   To learn more about these files, see :ref:`Realm Database Internals
   <node-realm-database>`.

.. warning:: Use Caution When Deleting Realm Files
   
   In some circumstances, such as a client reset scenario, you might need to
   delete a realm file and its auxiliary files.
   
   If you delete a realm file or any of its auxiliary files while one or
   more instances of the realm are open, you might corrupt the realm or
   disrupt :ref:`sync <sync>`.
   
   You may safely delete these files when all instances of a realm are
   closed. Before you delete a realm file, make sure that you back up any
   important objects as you will lose all unsynced data in the realm.

.. _node-in-memory-realm:

In-Memory Realms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also open a realm entirely in memory, which will not create a ``.realm``
file or its associated auxiliary files. Instead the SDK stores objects in memory
while the realm is open and discards them immediately when all instances are
closed.

.. _node-synced-realm:

Synced Realms
-------------

You can configure a realm to automatically synchronize data between many devices
that each have their own local copy of the data. Synced realms use a different
configuration than local-only realms and require an Atlas App Services backend to handle
the synchronization process.

Applications can always create, modify, and delete synced realm objects locally,
even when offline. Whenever a network connection is available, the Realm SDK
opens a connection to an application server and syncs changes to and from other
clients. The :ref:`Atlas Device Sync protocol <sync-protocol>` and server-side
operational transforms guarantee that all fully synced instances of a realm see
exactly the same data, even if some changes occurred offline and/or were
received out of order.

.. tip:: Learn How to Configure and Use Sync
   
   For more information on synced realms, including directions on how to set up
   sync in a Realm app, see :ref:`Atlas Device Sync Overview <sync>`.
   
   For code examples that show how to work with a synced realm in the Node.js
   SDK, see :ref:`Sync Changes Between Devices
   <node-sync-changes-between-devices>`.

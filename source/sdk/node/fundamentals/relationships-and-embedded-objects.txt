Relationships
-------------

{+service+} allows you to define explicit relationships between the types of
objects in a {+app+}. A relationship is an object property that references
another {+service-short+} object rather than a scalar or embedded object. You
define relationships by setting the type of an object property to another object
type in the :ref:`property schema <node-property-schema>`.

Relationships are direct references to other objects in a {+realm+}, which
means that you don't need bridge tables or explicit joins to define a
relationship like you would in a relational database. Instead you can
access related objects by reading and writing to the property that
defines the relationship. {+client-database+} executes read operations
lazily as they come in, so querying a relationship is just as performant
as reading a regular property.

There are three primary types of relationships between objects:

- :ref:`One-to-One Relationship <node-to-one-relationship>`
- :ref:`One-to-Many Relationship <node-to-many-relationship>`
- :ref:`Inverse Relationship <node-inverse-relationship>`

.. _node-to-one-relationship:

To-One Relationship
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **to-one** relationship means that an object is related in a specific
way to no more than one other object. You define a to-one relationship
for an object type in its :ref:`object schema <node-object-schema>` by
specifying a property where the type is the related {+service-short+} object type.

.. example::

   An application could use the following object schemas to indicate
   that a Person may or may not own a single Dog by including it in its
   ``dog`` property:
   
   .. tabs-realm-languages::
     
     .. tab::
         :tabid: javascript
 
         .. literalinclude:: /examples/Relationships/ToOne/ToOne.js
           :language: javascript
           :emphasize-lines: 6


.. _node-to-many-relationship:

To-Many Relationship
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **to-many** relationship means that an object is related in a specific
way to multiple objects. You define a to-many relationship for an object
type in its :ref:`object schema <node-object-schema>` by specifying a
property where the type is a list or array of the related {+service-short+} object
type.

.. example::
   
   An application could use the following object schemas to indicate
   that a Person may own multiple Dogs by including them in its ``dog``
   property:
   
   .. tabs-realm-languages::
   
      .. tab::
         :tabid: javascript
   
         .. literalinclude:: /examples/Relationships/ToMany/ToMany.js
            :language: javascript
            :emphasize-lines: 6

.. _node-inverse-relationship:

Inverse Relationship
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An **inverse relationship** links an object back to any other objects that refer
to it in a defined to-one or to-many relationship. Relationship definitions are
unidirectional, so you must explicitly define a property in the object's model
as an inverse relationship.

For example, the to-many relationship "User has many Tasks" does not
automatically create the inverse relationship "Task belongs to User". If you
don't specify the inverse relationship in the object model, you would need to
run a separate query to look up the user that is assigned to a given task.

To define an inverse relationship, define a ``linkingObjects`` property in your
object model. The ``linkingObjects`` definition specifies the object type and
property name of the relationship that it inverts.

You cannot manually set the value of an inverse relationship property.
{+client-database+} automatically updates implicit relationships whenever an
object is added or removed in the specified relationship.

.. example::
   
   An application could use the following object schemas to indicate that a User
   may be assigned many Tasks and that each Task should automatically keep track
   of which User it's assigned to.
   
   - The User object's ``tasks`` property is defined as a to-many relationship
     with Task objects and contains all of a given user's assigned tasks.
     
   - The Task object's ``assignee`` property inverts the relationship and
     automatically updates to refer back to any User object that contains the
     Task in its ``tasks`` property.

.. _node-embedded-objects:

Embedded Objects
----------------

An embedded object is a special type of :ref:`Realm object <node-realm-objects>`
that models complex data about a specific object. Embedded objects are similar
to :ref:`relationships <node-client-relationships>`, but they provide additional
constraints and map more naturally to the denormalized :manual:`MongoDB document
model </core/data-modeling-introduction/>`.

Realm enforces unique ownership constraints that treat each embedded object as
nested data inside of a single, specific parent object. An embedded object
inherits the lifecycle of its parent object and cannot exist as an independent
Realm object. This means that embedded objects cannot have a primary key and
that Realm automatically deletes embedded objects if their parent object is
deleted.

.. tip:: Embedded object types are reusable and composable

   You can use the same embedded object type in multiple parent object types and
   you can embed objects inside of other embedded objects. You can even
   recursively reference an embedded object type as an optional property in its
   own definition.

Realm Object Models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To specify that a Realm object model define an embedded object, set ``embedded``
to ``true``. You can reference an embedded object type from parent object types
in the same way as you would define a relationship:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 3, 18, 28
   
   const AddressSchema = {
     name: "Address",
     embedded: true, // default: false
     properties: {
       street: "string?",
       city: "string?",
       country: "string?",
       postalCode: "string?",
     },
   };
   
   const ContactSchema = {
     name: "Contact",
     primaryKey: "_id",
     properties: {
       _id: "objectId",
       name: "string",
       address: "Address", // Embed a single object
     },
   };
   
   const BusinessSchema = {
     name: "Business",
     primaryKey: "_id",
     properties: {
       _id: "objectId",
       name: "string",
       addresses: { type: "list", objectType: "Address" }, // Embed an array of objects
     },
   };

.. _node-add-a-property:

Add a Property
--------------

To add a property to a schema, add the new property to the object's class and
set a ``schemaVersion`` of the :js-sdk:`realm's configuration object <Realm.html#~Configuration>`.


.. example::
   
   A {+realm+} using schema version ``1`` has a ``Person`` object type with a
   ``firstName``, and ``lastName`` property. The developer decides to add an
   ``age`` property to the ``Person`` class. 

   To migrate the {+realm+} to conform to the updated ``Person`` schema, the
   developer sets the {+realm+}'s :ref:`schema version <node-schema-version>` to
   ``2``.

.. _node-delete-a-property:

Delete a Property
-----------------

To delete a property from a schema, remove the property from the object's class
and set a ``schemaVersion`` of the :js-sdk:`realm's configuration object
<Realm.html#~Configuration>`. Deleting a property will not impact existing
objects.

.. example::
   
   A {+realm+} using schema version ``1`` has a ``Dog`` object type with a
   ``weight`` property. The developer decides to remove the property from the
   schema.

   To migrate the {+realm+} to conform to the updated ``Dog`` schema, the
   developer sets the {+realm+}'s :ref:`schema version <node-schema-version>` to
   ``2``.

.. _node-rename-a-property:

Rename a Property
-----------------

To rename an object property, change the property name in the object schema and
then open the {+realm+} with an incremented :ref:`schema version
<node-schema-version>` and a :ref:`migration <node-migrations>` function that
updates existing objects to use the new property name.

Migrations do not allow you to directly rename a property. Instead you can
create a new property with the updated name, copy the value from the old
property, and then delete the old property.

.. example::
   
   A {+realm+} using schema version ``1`` has a ``Person`` object type. The
   original schema had a ``firstName`` and ``lastName`` field. The developer
   later decides that the ``Person`` class should use a combined ``fullName``
   field and removes the separate ``firstName`` and ``lastName`` fields.
   
   To migrate the {+realm+} to conform to the updated ``Person`` schema, the
   developer sets the {+realm+}'s :ref:`schema version <node-schema-version>` to
   ``2`` and defines a migration function to set the value of ``fullName`` based
   on the existing ``firstName`` and ``lastName`` properties.

   .. tabs-realm-languages::
     
     .. tab::
         :tabid: javascript
 
         .. literalinclude:: /examples/Migrations/LocalMigration/LocalMigration.js
           :language: javascript
           :emphasize-lines: 3, 14

.. important:: Synced Realms

   :ref:`Synced realms <sync>` only support additive changes to ensure that
   older clients can sync with newer clients. Because full renames require you
   to delete the old property, you cannot rename a synchronized property without
   requiring a client reset. Instead, consider adding
   the renamed property without deleting the old property.

Modify a Property Type
----------------------
To modify a property's type, set the property type of the field that you wish to
modify to the new data type. Then, set a ``schemaVersion``, and a ``migration``
callback function of the :js-sdk:`realm's configuration Object
<Realm.html#~Configuration>`. 

.. note::

   :doc:`Synchronized realms </sync/>` only support additive changes,
   to ensure that older clients can sync with newer clients. This means that
   synchronized realms do not support modifying the type of a property of a
   schema. 


.. example::
   
   A {+realm+} using schema version ``1`` has a ``Dog`` object type. The
   original schema had an ``_id`` with a property type of ``Object ID``. The
   developer later decides that the ``Dog`` class's ``_id`` field should be of
   type ``string``, and updates the schema.

   To migrate the {+realm+} to conform to the updated ``Dog`` schema, the
   developer sets the {+realm+}'s :ref:`schema version <node-schema-version>` to
   ``2`` and defines a migration function to convert the ``Object ID`` type to a
   ``string`` type.

.. _node-add-a-property:

Add a Property
--------------

To add a property to an schema, add the new property to the object's class and
set a ``schemaVersion`` of the :js-sdk:`Realm's configuration object <Realm.html#~Configuration>`.

.. _node-delete-a-property:

Delete a Property
-----------------

To delete a property from a schema, remove the property from the object's class
and set a ``schemaVersion`` of the :js-sdk:`Realm's configuration object
<Realm.html#~Configuration>`. Deleting a property will not impact existing
objects. 

.. _node-rename-a-property:

Rename a Property
-----------------

To rename a property of the schema, rename the property of the object's class.
Then, set a ``schemaVersion`` and a ``migration`` callback function of the
:js-sdk:`Realm's configuration Object <Realm.html#~Configuration>`. 

.. note::

   Synchronized Realms only support additive changes, to ensure that older
   clients can continue to sync with newer clients. This means that synchronized
   realms do not support renaming a property of the schema.


<replace me with existing use case>

Modify a Property Type
----------------------
To modify a property's type, set the property type of the field that you wish to
modify to the new data type. Then, set a ``schemaVersion``, and a ``migration``
callback function of the :js-sdk:`Realm's configuration Object
<Realm.html#~Configuration>`. 

.. note::

   Synchronized Realms only support additive changes, to ensure that older
   clients can continue to sync with newer clients. This means that synchronized
   realms do not support modifying the type of a property of a schema.

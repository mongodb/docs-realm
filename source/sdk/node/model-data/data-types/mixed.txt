.. versionchanged:: 12.9.0

   Mixed properties can contain lists or dictionaries of mixed data.

.. versionadded:: 10.5.0

The mixed data type is a realm property type that can hold any valid Realm data
type except an embedded object or a set.
You can create collections (lists, sets, and dictionaries) of type ``mixed``. Properties using the mixed data type can also hold null values.

.. note::

   The mixed data type is indexable, but you can't use it as a primary key.
   Because null is a permitted value, you can't declare a Mixed property as
   optional.

Realm Object Models
-------------------
To :ref:`set a property of your object model
<node-define-a-realm-object-schema>` as mixed, set the property's type to
"``mixed``".

Create an Object With a Mixed Value
-----------------------------------
Create an object with a mixed value by running the :js-sdk:`realm.create()
<classes/Realm-1.html#create>` method within a write transaction.

Nested Collections of Mixed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 12.9.0

Starting with Node.js SDK v12.9.0, a mixed data type can
hold collections (a list or dictionary, but *not* a set) of mixed elements.

These collections of mixed data can be nested and can contain other
collections. They can also be
:ref:`listened to for changes <node-collection-listener>` like a
normal collection.

You can leverage these nested collections to define unstructured
or variable data in your data model. For more information, refer to
:ref:`<node-model-unstructured-data>`.

To create nested collections of mixed data in your app, define the mixed type
property in your data model the same way you would any other mixed type.
Then, you can create the list or dictionary collection.

Query for Objects with a Mixed Value
------------------------------------
Query for objects with a mixed value by running the
:js-sdk:`Collection.filtered() <classes/OrderedCollection.html#filtered>`
method and passing in a :ref:`filter <node-filter-queries>` for a non-mixed
field. You can then print the value of the mixed property or the entire
object itself.

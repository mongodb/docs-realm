Overview
--------

You can encrypt the realm database file on disk with AES-256 +
SHA-2 by supplying a 64-byte encryption key when :ref:`opening a
realm <node-open-a-local-realm>`.

Realm transparently encrypts and decrypts data with standard
:wikipedia:`AES-256 encryption <Advanced_Encryption_Standard>` using the
first 256 bits of the given 512-bit encryption key. Realm
uses the other 256 bits of the 512-bit encryption key to validate
integrity using a :wikipedia:`hash-based message authentication code
(HMAC) <HMAC>`.

Considerations
--------------

The following are key impacts to consider when encrypting a realm.

Storing & Reusing Keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You **must** pass the same encryption key every time you open the encrypted realm. 
If you don't provide a key or specify the wrong key for an encrypted
realm, the Realm SDK throws an error.

Apps should store the encryption key securely, typically in the target
platform's secure key/value storage, so that other apps cannot read the key.

Performance Impact
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reads and writes on encrypted realms can be up to 10% slower than unencrypted realms.

Encryption and Atlas Device Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can encrypt a :ref:`synced realm <node-open-a-synced-realm>`. 

.. include:: /includes/encrypt-atlas-device-sync.rst

If you need unique keys for each user of your application, you can use an OAuth provider or
use one of the :ref:`Realm authentication providers <users-and-authentication>` 
and an :ref:`authentication trigger<authentication-triggers>`
to create a 64-bit key and store that key in a :ref:`user object <user-objects>`.

Accessing an Encrypted Realm from Multiple Processes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

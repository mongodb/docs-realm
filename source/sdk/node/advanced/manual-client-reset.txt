.. note:: Manual Recovery is Manual

   Manual recovery requires significant amounts of code, schema concessions,
   and custom conflict resolution logic. If your application can accommodate
   losing unsynced data during a client reset, try the
   :ref:`discard unsynced changes <node-discard-unsynced-changes>`
   client reset strategy instead.

.. warning:: Avoid Making Destructive Schema Changes in Production

   Do not expect to recover all unsynced data after a destructive schema
   change. The best way to preserve user data is to never make a
   destructive schema change at all.

The **manually recover unsynced changes** client reset strategy gives
developers the opportunity to recover data already written to
the client realm file but not yet synced to the backend. The
following steps demonstrate the process at a high level:

1. **Client reset error**: Your application receives a client reset
   error code from the backend.

#. **Strategy implementation**: The SDK calls your strategy
   implementation.

#. **Close all instances of the realm**: Close *all open instances* of
   the realm experiencing the
   client reset. If your application architecture makes this difficult
   (for instance, if your app uses many realm instances simultaneously
   in listeners throughout the application), it may be easier to restart
   the application. You can do this programmatically or through a direct
   request to the user in a dialog.

#. TODO(DOCSP-20821): find JS equivalent...
   **Move the realm to a backup file**: Call the ``executeClientReset()``
   method of the provided :java-sdk:`ClientResetRequiredError
   <io/realm/mongodb/sync/ClientResetRequiredError.html#getBackupFile()>`.
   This method moves the current copy of the client realm file to a
   backup file.

#. **Open new instance of the realm**: Open a new instance of the realm
   using your typical sync configuration. If your application uses
   multiple realms, you can identify the realm experiencing a client
   reset from the backup file name.

#. TODO(DOCSP-20821): find JS equivalent...
   **Download all realm data from the backend**: Download the entire set
   of data in the realm before you proceed. If your sync configuration
   doesn't specify the :java-sdk:`waitForInitialRemoteData()
   <io/realm/mongodb/sync/SyncConfiguration.Builder.html#waitForInitialRemoteData(long,java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit)>`
   option, you can call :java-sdk:`SyncSession.downloadAllServerChanges()
   <io/realm/mongodb/sync/SyncSession.html#downloadAllServerChanges(long,java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit)>`
   after opening the realm.

#. TODO(DOCSP-20821): find JS equivalent...
   **Open the realm backup**: Use the :java-sdk:`getBackupRealmConfiguration()
   <io/realm/mongodb/sync/ClientResetRequiredError.html#getBackupRealmConfiguration()>`
   method of the provided ``ClientResetRequiredError`` to open an
   instance of the client realm file from the backup file. You must open
   this instance as a :java-sdk:`DynamicRealm <io/realm/DynamicRealm.html>`,
   a type of realm that uses text field lookups for all data access.

#. **Migrate unsynced changes**: Query the backup realm for data to
   recover. Insert, delete or update data in the new realm accordingly.

TODO(DOCSP-20821): find JS equivalent...
To handle client resets with the "manually recover unsynced changes"
strategy,  pass an instance of :java-sdk:`ManuallyRecoverUnsyncedChangesStrategy

the :java-sdk:`defaultSyncClientResetStrategy()
<io/realm/mongodb/AppConfiguration.Builder.html#defaultSyncClientResetStrategy(io.realm.mongodb.sync.DiscardUnsyncedChangesStrategy)>`
builder method when you instantiate your ``App``. Your
``ManuallyRecoverUnsyncedChangesStrategy`` instance must implement the
following methods:

- TODO(DOCSP-20821): find JS equivalent...
  ``onClientReset()``: called when the SDK receives a client reset error
  from the backend.

The following example implements this strategy:

TODO(DOCSP-20821): small JS example

.. note:: ``handleManualReset()`` Implementation

   This client reset example calls a separate method that handles the
   specific logic of the client reset. Continue reading the sections
   below for an :ref:`example implementation <node-manual-recovery-implementation>`.

The specifics of manual recovery depend heavily upon your application
and your schema. However, there are a few techniques that can help with
most manual recoveries. The following example implementation demonstrates
one method of recovering unsynced changes from a backup realm.

Example
-------

This example adds a "Last Updated Time" to each object model to track
when each object last changed. We'll watch the realm for the
"Last Synced Time" to determine when the realm last uploaded its state
to the backend. Then, we can find objects that were deleted, created,
or updated since the last sync with the backend, and copy that data from
the backup realm to the new realm.

.. _node-manual-recovery-implementation-track-updates:

Track Updates to Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ordinarily, there is no way to detect when a Realm object was last
modified. This makes it difficult to determine which changes were synced
to the backend. By adding a timestamp to your Realm object classes and
updating that timestamp to the current time whenever a change occurs,
you can keep track of when objects were changed:

TODO(DOCSP-20821): track updates to objects code snippet

.. _node-manual-recovery-implementation-track-successful-syncs:

Track Successful Syncs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just knowing when objects were changed isn't enough to recover data
during a client reset. You also need
to know when the realm last completed a sync successfully. This example
implementation uses a singleton object called ``LastSynced`` in the
realm, paired with an upload progress listener, to record whenever a
realm finishes syncing successfully.

TODO(DOCSP-20821): track updates to objects code snippet

TODO(DOCSP-20821): javascript-ify

You can use :java-sdk:`SyncSession.addUploadProgressListener()
<io/realm/mongodb/sync/SyncSession.html#addUploadProgressListener(io.realm.mongodb.sync.ProgressMode,io.realm.mongodb.sync.ProgressListener)>`
to listen for upload progress events in your ``App``. Implement
``onChange()`` to handle these events. Call
:java-sdk:`Progress.isTransferComplete()
<io/realm/mongodb/sync/Progress.html#isTransferComplete()>` to check if
the upload has completed. When ``isTransferComplete()`` returns true,
all clientside updates, inserts, and deletes in the realm have
successfully synced to the backend, and you can
update the ``LastSynced`` time to the current time. To prevent
``LastSynced`` from looping on updates to the ``LastSynced`` time,
don't update the ``LastSynced`` time if it's been less than, say,
10ms since you last updated the time.

Register your progress listener with :java-sdk:`ProgressMode.INDEFINITELY
<io/realm/mongodb/sync/ProgressMode.html#INDEFINITELY>` to subscribe
your listener to all future upload progress events, instead of just the
current upload's progress events.

TODO(DOCSP-20821): code example for keeping track of last sync time


.. _node-manual-recovery-implementation:

Manual Recovery with Last Updated Time and Last Synced Time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that you've recorded update times for all objects in your application
as well as the last time your application completed a sync, it's time to
implement the manual recovery process. This example handles two main
recovery operations:

- restoring unsynced inserts and updates from the backup realm
- deleting objects from the new realm that were previously deleted from
  the backup realm

You can follow along with the implementation of these operations in the
code samples below.

TODO(DOCSP-20821): code example for handling manual reset 

.. note:: This Example is Simplified

   This example keeps track of the last time each *object* was updated. As
   a result, the recovery operation overwrites the entire object in the
   new realm if any field was updated after the last successful sync
   of the backup realm. This could overwrite fields updated by other
   clients with old data from this client. If your realm objects contain
   multiple fields containing important data, consider keeping track of
   the last updated time of each *field* instead, and recovering each
   field individually.

Alternative Implementations
---------------------------

Other possible implementations include:

TODO(DOCSP-20821): see what the JS equivalent is of ``insertOrUpdate()``


- **Overwrite the entire backend with the backup state**:
  with no "last updated time" or "last synced time", ``insertOrUpdate()``
  all objects from the backup realm into the new realm. There is no way
  to recovered unsynced deletions with this approach. This approach
  overwrites all data written to the backend by other clients since the
  last sync. Recommended for applications where only one user writes
  to each realm.

- **Track changes by field**:
  Instead of tracking a "last updated time" for every *object*, track the
  "last updated time" for every *field*. Update fields individually using
  this logic to avoid overwriting field writes from other clients with
  old data. Recommended for applications with many fields per-object
  where conflicts must be resolved at the field level.

- **Track updates separately from objects**:
  Instead of tracking a "last updated time" in the schema of each object,
  create another model in your schema called ``Updates``. Every time any
  field in any object (besides ``Updates``) updates, record the primary
  key, field, and time of the update. During a client reset, "re-write"
  all of the ``Update`` events that occurred after the "last synced time"
  using the latest value of that field in the backup realm.
  This approach should replicate all unsynced local changes in the new
  realm without overwriting any fields with stale data. However, storing
  the collection of updates could become expensive if your application
  writes frequently. Recommended for applications where adding "lastUpdated"
  fields to object models is undesirable.

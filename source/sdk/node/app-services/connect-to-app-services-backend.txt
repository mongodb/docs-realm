The App client is the interface to the Atlas App Services
backend. It provides access to the :ref:`authentication functionality
<node-authenticate-users>`, :ref:`functions <node-call-a-function>`, and
:ref:`sync management <node-sync-changes-between-devices>`.

Before You Begin
----------------

#. :ref:`Create an App Services App <create-a-realm-app>`
#. :ref:`Install the Realm Node.js SDK <node-install>`

.. _node-access-the-app-client:

Access the App Client
---------------------

To connect to the App Services backend from your client, you need to create a 
:js-sdk:`configuration object <types/AppConfiguration.html>`. Then, pass
that configuration object to a ``Realm.App()`` instance.

You must include the ``id`` field and the :guilabel:`App ID` for your App Services App, which you can 
:ref:`find in the App Services UI <find-your-app-id>`.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/quickstart.snippet.initialize.ts
  :language: javascript

You can create multiple App client instances to connect to multiple
Apps. All App client instances that share the same App ID use the same 
underlying connection.

.. important:: Changing an App Config After Initializing the App

   .. versionchanged:: 12.6.0 
      ``baseUrl`` is not cached in the App configuration.

   When you initialize the App client, the configuration is cached internally. 
   Attempting to close and then re-open an App with a changed configuration
   within the same process has no effect. The client continues to use the 
   cached configuration. 

   Starting with Node.js SDK version 12.6.0, the ``baseUrl`` in the ``AppConfiguration``
   is *not* cached. This means that you can change the ``baseUrl``, and the App 
   client will use the updated configuration. In earlier SDK versions, changes 
   to the ``baseUrl`` in a cached App configuration have no effect.

.. _node-app-retrieve-client:

Retrieve an Instance of the App Client
--------------------------------------

To retrieve an instance of the App Client from anywhere in your application, 
call :js-sdk:`Realm.App.getApp() <classes/App.html#getApp>` and pass in your 
:guilabel:`App ID`. 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/authenticate.snippet.get-app-instance.ts
  :language: javascript

.. _node-app-client-configure-timeout:

Configure a Timeout for the App Client
--------------------------------------

You can configure an optional ``timeout`` for requests in your 
:js-sdk:`AppConfiguration <types/AppConfiguration.html>`. It accepts a number
of milliseconds before the request should timeout.

You can use this timeout interval with the optional Sync configuration 
``cancelWaitsOnNonFatalErrors`` boolean. When the timeout interval elapses, 
any outstanding work that is awaiting uploads and downloads cancels. When
this setting is false, awaiting uploads and downloads does not cancel 
because Realm treats these timeouts as non-fatal errors. 

For an example, refer to :ref:`node-cancel-async-after-timeout`.

   :language: javascript

.. _node-encrypt-app-metadata:

Encrypt App Metadata
--------------------

You can encrypt the metadata that App Services stores on client devices. Use the
values of the :js-sdk:`MetadataMode enum <enums/_internal_.MetadataMode.html>`
to determine encryption behavior.

To encrypt App metadata:

#. Import ``MetadataMode`` from ``Realm`` and import other dependencies:

   .. tabs-realm-languages::

      .. tab::
         :tabid: typescript

         .. include:: /examples/generated/node/v12/formatted/metadata.test.snippet.imports.ts.rst
      
      .. tab::
         :tabid: javascript

         .. include:: /examples/generated/node/v12/formatted/metadata.test.snippet.imports.js.rst

#. Create an App configuration object that contains the ``metadata`` property.
#. Set ``metadata.mode`` to ``MetadataMode.Encryption``.
#. Set ``metadata.encryptionKey`` to the key you want to use for encryption.
#. Pass the App configuration object to ``new Realm.App()``.

Connect to a Specific Server
----------------------------

By default, Atlas Device SDK connects to Atlas using the global ``baseURL``
of ``https://services.cloud.mongodb.com``. In some cases, you may want to
connect to a different server:

- Your App Services App uses :ref:`local deployment <local-deployment>`, and 
  you want to connect directly to a local ``baseURL`` in your region.
- You want to connect to an :ref:`Edge Server instance <edge-server-connect-from-client>`.

You can specify a ``baseURL`` in the 
:js-sdk:`AppConfiguration <types/Realm.AppConfiguration.html>`:

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: typescript

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/v12/formatted/app-services.test.snippet.custom-base-url.ts.rst
        :language: typescript

   .. tab::
      :tabid: javascript

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/node/v12/formatted/app-services.test.snippet.custom-base-url.js.rst
        :language: javascript

.. _node-change-server-during-runtime:

Connect to a Different Server During Runtime
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 12.8.0

In some cases, you might want to change the ``baseURL`` while the app is
running. For example, you might want to roam between Edge Servers, or
move from an App Services connection to an Edge Server connection. 

To change the ``baseURL`` during runtime, call the ``app.updateBaseUrl()``
method. Note that the string value can't end in a trailing slash.

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: typescript

      .. include:: /examples/generated/node/v12/formatted/app-services.test.snippet.change-base-url.ts.rst

   .. tab::
      :tabid: javascript

      .. include:: /examples/generated/node/v12/formatted/app-services.test.snippet.change-base-url.js.rst

This API is experimental, so you must use the experimental import in the file
where you want to use this API:

.. include:: /examples/generated/node/v12/formatted/app-services.test.snippet.import-experimental-baseurl.ts.rst

.. _node-change-server-typescript:

TypeScript Config for Experimental API
``````````````````````````````````````

The ``app.updateBaseUrl()`` method is in an experimental module that you must
import separately. To get the proper types from this module, you need to set the
following fields in your ``tsconfig.json`` file:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: true

   {
      "target": "es2022",
      "module": "node16",
      "moduleResolution": "node16",
      // ...
   }


Change Server with Logged-in User
`````````````````````````````````

If you want to change the ``baseURL`` after you have logged in a user and
have opened a synced database, the app must perform a 
:ref:`client reset <node-perform-a-client-reset>`. Perform these steps in your
code:

1. :ref:`Pause the Sync session <node-pause-or-resume-a-sync-session>`.
2. Update the ``baseURL`` by calling the ``app.updateBaseUrl()`` method.
3. Go through the authentication flow again to log in the user through the
   new ``baseURL``.
4. Open a synced database pulling data from the new server.

Both the server and the client must be online for the user to authenticate and
connect to the new server. If the server is not online or the client does not
have a network connection, the user cannot authenticate and open the database.

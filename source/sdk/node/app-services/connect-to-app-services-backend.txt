The App client is the interface to the Atlas App Services
backend. It provides access to the :ref:`authentication functionality
<node-authenticate-users>`, :ref:`functions <node-call-a-function>`, and
:ref:`sync management <node-sync-changes-between-devices>`.

Before You Begin
----------------

#. :ref:`Create an App Services App <create-a-realm-app>`
#. :ref:`Install the Realm Node.js SDK <node-install>`

.. _node-access-the-app-client:

Access the App Client
---------------------

To connect to the App Services backend from your client, you need to create a 
:js-sdk:`configuration object <Realm.App.html#~AppConfiguration>`. Then, pass
that configuration object to a ``Realm.App()`` instance.
 
You must include the ``id`` field and the :guilabel:`App ID` for your App Services App, which you can 
:ref:`find in the App Services UI <find-your-app-id>`.

.. _node-app-retrieve-client:

Retrieve an Instance of the App Client
--------------------------------------

To retrieve an instance of the App Client from anywhere in your application, 
call :js-sdk:`Realm.App.getApp() <Realm.App.html#getApp>` and pass in your 
:guilabel:`App ID`.

  :language: javascript

.. _node-app-client-configure-timeout:

Configure a Timeout for the App Client
--------------------------------------

You can configure an optional ``timeout`` for requests in your 
:js-sdk:`AppConfiguration <types/AppConfiguration.html>`. It accepts a number
of milliseconds before the request should timeout.

You can use this timeout interval with the optional Sync configuration 
``cancelWaitsOnNonFatalErrors`` boolean. When the timeout interval elapses, 
any outstanding work that is awaiting uploads and downloads cancels. When
this setting is false, awaiting uploads and downloads does not cancel 
because Realm treats these timeouts as non-fatal errors. 

For an example, refer to :ref:`node-cancel-async-after-timeout`.

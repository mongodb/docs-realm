Overview
--------

``UUID`` (Universal Unique Identifier) is a 16-byte :wikipedia:`unique value
<Universally_unique_identifier>`. You can use ``UUID`` as an identifier for
objects. ``UUID`` is :ref:`indexable <node-indexes>` and you can use it as a
:ref:`primary key <node-primary-keys>`.

.. note:: Using UUID Instead of ObjectId

   In general, you can use ``UUID`` for any fields that function as a unique
   identifier. Using ``UUID`` might be particularly useful if you are migrating
   data not stored in MongoDB since it is likely that your object's unique
   identifiers are already of a ``UUID`` type. Alternatively, using ``ObjectId``
   might be useful for a collection of data that already exists in MongoDB.

Usage
----- 
To define a property as a ``UUID``, set its type to the string ``"uuid"`` in
your :ref:`object model <node-object-schemas>`. Create a {+service-short+}
object within a write transaction. To set any unique identifier properties of
your object to a random value, call ``new UUID()``. Alternatively, pass a string
to ``new UUID()`` to set the unique identifier property to a specific value.

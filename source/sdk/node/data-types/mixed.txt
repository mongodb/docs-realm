Overview
--------
The mixed data type is a {+realm+} property type that can hold any valid Realm data type except a collection.
You can create collections (lists, sets, and dictionaries) of type ``mixed``, but a ``mixed`` itself 
cannot be a collection. Properties using the mixed data type can also hold null values.

.. note:: 

   The mixed data type is indexable, but you can't use it as a primary key.
   Because null is a permitted value, you can't declare a Mixed property as
   optional.

Realm Object Models
-------------------
To :ref:`set a property of your object model
<node-define-a-realm-object-schema>` as ``Mixed``, set the property's type to
"``mixed``".

Create an Object With a Mixed Value
-----------------------------------
Create an object with a mixed value by running the :js-sdk:`realm.create()
<Realm.html#create>` method within a write transaction.

Query for Objects with a Mixed Value
------------------------------------
Query for objects with a mixed value by running the
:js-sdk:`Collection.filtered() <Realm.Collection.html#filtered>` method and
passing in a :ref:`filter <node-filter-queries>` for a non-mixed field. You can
then print the value of the mixed property or the entire object itself.

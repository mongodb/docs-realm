A **realm** is a set of related objects that conform to a pre-defined
schema. Realms may contain more than one type of data as long as a 
schema exists for each type.

Every realm stores data in a separate realm file that 
contains a binary encoding of each object in the realm. You can
automatically :ref:`synchronize realm across multiple
devices <sync>` and set up :ref:`reactive
event handlers <java-realm-notifications>` that call a
function any time an object in a realm is created,
modified, or deleted.

.. _java-realm-types:

Types of Realm
--------------

When opening a realm, you can configure many properties of the realm.

.. _java-read-only-realms-fundamentals:

Read-Only Realms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's sometimes useful to ship a prepared realm file with your app
that contains shared data that does not frequently change. You can use
the :java-sdk:`readOnly() <io/realm/RealmConfiguration.Builder.html#readOnly-->`
method when configuring your realm to make it read-only. This can
prevent accidental writes to the realm and causes the realm to
throw an ``IllegalStateException`` if a write occurs.

.. warning:: Read-Only Realm Files are Writeable

   Read-only realms are only enforced as read-only in process.
   The realm file itself is still writeable.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`Usage Examples: Read-Only Realms <java-read-only-realms>`

.. _java-in-memory-realms-fundamentals:

In-Memory Realms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a realm that runs entirely in memory without being written
to a file, use the :java-sdk:`inMemory() <io/realm/RealmConfiguration.Builder.html#inMemory-->` method.

When memory runs low on an Android device, in-memory realms
may :wikipedia:`swap <Memory_paging#Terminology>` temporarily from main
memory to disk space. The SDK deletes all files created by an in-memory
realm when:

- the realm closes
- all references to that realm fall out of scope

.. seealso::

   :ref:`Usage Examples: In-Memory Realms <java-in-memory-realms>`

.. _java-dynamic-realms-fundamentals:

Dynamic Realms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Conventional realms define a schema using ``RealmObject`` subclasses
or the ``RealmModel`` interface. A
:java-sdk:`DynamicRealm <io/realm/DynamicRealm.html>` uses strings to
define a schema at runtime. Opening a dynamic realm uses the same
configuration as a conventional realm, but dynamic realms ignore
all configured schema, migration, and schema versions.

Dynamic realms offer flexibility at the expense of type safety and
performance. As a result, only use dynamic realms when that
flexibility is required, such as during migrations, manual client
resets, and when working with string-based data like CSV files or JSON.

.. _java-realm-lifecycle:

The Realm Lifecycle
-------------------

Every realm instance consumes a significant amount of resources.
Opening and closing a realm are both expensive operations, but
keeping a realm open also incurs significant resource overhead. To
maximize the performance of your application, you should minimize the
number of open realms at any given time and limit the number of
open and close operations used.

However, opening a realm is not always consistently expensive.
If the realm is already open within the same process or thread,
opening an additional instance requires fewer resources:

- If the realm is not open within the same process, opening the
  realm is expensive.

- If the realm is already open on a different thread within the
  same process, opening the realm is less expensive, but still
  nontrivial.

- If the realm is already open on the same thread within the same
  process, opening the realm requires minimal additional resources.

When you open a realm for the first time, Realm Database
performs the memory-mapping and schema validation required to read and
write data to the realm. Additional instances of that
realm on the same thread use the same underlying resources.
Instances of that realm on separate threads use some of the same
underlying resources.

When all connections to a realm are closed in
a thread, Realm Database frees the thread resources used to
connect to that realm. When all connections to a realm are
closed in a process, Realm Database frees all resources used to
connect to that realm.

As a best practice, we recommend tying the realm instance
lifecycle to the lifecycles of the views that observe the realm. For
instance, consider a ``RecyclerView`` that displays ``RealmResults``
data via a ``Fragment``. You could:

- Open a single realm that contains the data for that view
  in the ``Fragment.onCreateView()`` lifecycle method.
- Close that same realm in the ``Fragment.onDestroyView()``
  lifecycle method.

.. note::

   If your realm is especially large, fetching a realm instance
   in ``Fragment.onCreateView()`` may briefly block rendering. If
   opening your realm in ``onCreateView()`` causes performance
   issues, consider managing the realm from ``Fragment.onStart()``
   and ``Fragment.onStop()`` instead.

If multiple ``Fragment`` instances require access to the same dataset,
you could manage a single realm in the enclosing ``Activity``:

- Open the realm in the ``Activity.onCreate()`` lifecycle method.
- Close the realm in the ``Activity.onDestroy()`` lifecycle method.

Multi-process
-------------

You cannot access :ref:`encrypted <java-encrypt-a-realm>` or
:ref:`synced <java-sync-changes-between-devices>` realms
simultaneously from different processes. However, local realms
function normally across processes, so you can read, write, and
receive notifications from multiple APKs.

Comparison with Other Databases
-------------------------------

The Realm data model is similar to both relational and document
databases but has distinct differences from both. To underscore these
differences, it's helpful to highlight what a realm **is not**:

A realm is not a single, application-wide database.
    Unlike other applications, which store all of their data in a single
    database, Apps often split data across multiple realms to
    organize data more efficiently and to enforce access controls.

A realm is not a table.
    Tables typically only store one kind of information, such as street
    addresses or items in a store inventory, whereas a realm can contain
    any number of object types.

A realm is not a collection of schemaless documents.
    Application objects are similar to documents, but every object in a
    realm conforms to a defined schema for its object type. An object
    cannot contain a field that is not described by its schema.

.. _java-realm-schema:

Realm Schema
------------

A **Realm Schema** is a list of valid :ref:`object schemas
<java-realm-objects>` that each define an object type that an App
may persist. All objects in a realm must conform to the Realm Schema.

By default, the SDK automatically adds all classes in your project
that derive from :java-sdk:`RealmObject <io/realm/RealmObject.html>` to the
realm schema.

Client applications provide a Realm Schema when they open a
realm. If a realm already contains data, then Realm Database
validates each existing object to ensure that an object schema was
provided for its type and that it meets all of the constraints specified
in the schema.

.. example::
   
   A realm that contains basic data about books in libraries might use a
   schema like the following:
   
   .. code-block:: json
      
      [
        {
          "type": "Library",
          "properties": {
            "address": "string",
            "books": "Book[]"
          }
        },
        {
          "type": "Book",
          "primaryKey": "isbn",
          "properties": {
            "isbn": "string",
            "title": "string",
            "author": "string",
            "numberOwned": { "type": "int?", "default": 0 },
            "numberLoaned": { "type": "int?", "default": 0 }
          }
        }
      ]

.. _java-realm-path:

Synced Realms
-------------

When you use :ref:`Partition-Based Sync <partition-based-sync>`, synced 
realms represent partitions of Atlas data. Each realm corresponds to 
a subset of the data in your App's data source. You can customize the
:ref:`partitioning <sync-partitions>` of data using your application's
:ref:`partition key <partition-key>`. Unique values of the partition
key, known as :ref:`partition values <partition-value>`, correspond to
individual realms.

When you use :ref:`Flexible Sync <flexible-sync>`, you can customize the 
data your client application syncs by :ref:`subscribing to queries 
<java-sync-subscribe-to-queryable-fields>`. These queries search for 
data in your App backend, and the Flexible Sync realm syncs data that 
matches the queries. The client application can only sync data where the
user has the appropriate :ref:`read or read and write permissions 
<flexible-sync-rules-and-permissions>` to access the data.

You can customize permissions for the data that synced realms can read
and write from your App when you configure 
:ref:`Realm Rules <sync-rules>`.

.. _java-realm-file:

Find Your Realm File
--------------------

Realm Database stores a binary encoded version of every object
and type in a realm in a single ``.realm`` file.

.. include:: /includes/find-realm-file-java.rst

.. seealso:: Auxiliary Realm Files
   
   Realm Database creates additional files for each realm.
   To learn more about these files, see :ref:`Realm Database Internals
   <java-realm-database>`.

.. _java-realm-file-size:

Realm File Size
---------------

Realm Database usually takes up less space on disk than an
equivalent SQLite database. However, in order to give you a consistent
view of your data, Realm operates on multiple versions of a
realm. If many versions of a realm are opened simultaneously,
the realm file can require additional space on disk.

These versions take up an amount of space dependent on the amount of
changes in each transaction. Many small transactions have the same
overhead as a small number of large transactions.

Unexpected file size growth usually happens for one of three reasons:

1) *You open a realm on a background thread and forget to close it
   again.* As a result, Realm Database retains a reference to the
   older version of data on the background thread. Because
   Realm Database automatically updates realms to the most
   recent version on threads with loopers, the UI thread and other
   Looper threads do not have this problem.

2) *You hold references to too many versions of frozen objects.*
   Frozen objects preserve the version of a realm that existed when
   the object was first frozen. If you need to freeze a large number of
   objects, consider using :java-sdk:`Realm.copyFromRealm()
   <io/realm/Realm.html#copyFromRealm-E->` instead to only preserve the
   data you need.

3) *You read some data from a realm. Then, you block the thread with
   a long-running operation. Meanwhile, you write many times to the
   realm on other threads.* This causes Realm Database to
   create many intermediate versions. You can avoid this by:

   - batching the writes

   - avoiding leaving the realm open while otherwise blocking the
     background thread.

.. _java-limit-max-number-of-active-versions:

Limit the Maximum Number of Active Versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can set :java-sdk:`maxNumberOfActiveVersions()
<io/realm/RealmConfiguration.Builder.html#maxNumberOfActiveVersions-long->`
when building your ``RealmConfiguration`` to throw an
``IllegalStateException`` if your application opens more versions of
a realm than the permitted number. Versions are created when
executing a write transaction.

Realm Database automatically removes older versions of data once
they are no longer used by your application. However,
Realm Database does not free the space used by older versions of
data; instead, that space is used for new writes to the realm.

.. _java-compact-a-realm:

Compact a Realm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can remove unused space by **compacting** the realm file:

- Manually: call :java-sdk:`compactRealm()
  <io/realm/Realm.html#compactRealm-io.realm.RealmConfiguration->`

- Automatically: specify the :java-sdk:`compactOnLaunch()
  <io/realm/RealmConfiguration.Builder.html#compactOnLaunch-io.realm.CompactOnLaunchCallback->`
  builder option when opening the first connection to a realm in your
  Android application

.. important:: Compact All Production Applications

   Every production application should implement compacting to 
   periodically reduce realm file size.

.. _java-backup-and-restore-realms:

Backup and Restore Realms
-------------------------

Realm Database persists realms to disk using files on your
Android device. To back up a realm, :ref:`find your realm file
<java-realm-file>` and copy it to a safe location. You should close
all instances of the realm before copying it.

Alternatively, you can also use :java-sdk:`realm.writeCopyTo()
<io/realm/Realm.html#writeCopyTo-java.io.File->` to write a compacted
version of a realm to a destination file.

   Google Drive, see the following article series: (`Part 1

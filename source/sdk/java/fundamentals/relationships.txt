{+service+} allows you to define explicit relationships between the types of
objects in a {+app+}. A relationship is an object property that references
another {+service-short+} object rather than one of the primitive data types. You
define relationships by setting the type of an object property to
another object type in the :ref:`property schema <property-schema>`.

Relationships are direct references to other objects in a {+realm+}, which
means that you don't need bridge tables or explicit joins to define a
relationship like you would in a relational database. Instead you can
access related objects by reading and writing to the property that
defines the relationship. {+client-database+} executes read operations
lazily as they come in, so querying a relationship is just as performant
as reading a regular property.

There are three primary types of relationships between objects:

- :ref:`One-to-One Relationship <java-to-one-relationship>`
- :ref:`One-to-Many Relationship <java-to-many-relationship>`
- :ref:`Inverse Relationship <java-inverse-relationship>`

Key Concepts
------------

You can define relationships, collections, and embedded objects in your
object schema using the following types:

- ``RealmObject``
- ``RealmList <? extends RealmObject>``

Use annotations to indicate whether a given field represents a foreign
key relationship or an embedded object relationship. For more
information, see :ref:`Relationship Annotations <java-relationships>`.

.. _java-to-one-relationship:

To-One Relationship
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **to-one** relationship means that an object is related in a specific
way to no more than one other object. You define a to-one relationship
for an object type in its :ref:`object schema <java-object-schema>` by
specifying a property where the type is the related {+service-short+} object type.

Setting a relationship field to null removes the connection between
objects, but {+client-database+} does not delete the referenced object
unless that object is :ref:`embedded <java-field-relationships-embedded>`.

.. _java-to-many-relationship:

To-Many Relationship
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **to-many** relationship means that an object is related in a specific
way to multiple objects. You can create a relationship between one object
and any number of objects using a field of type ``RealmList<?>``
where ``T`` is a {+service-short+} object in your application:

   :ref:`Usage Example: To-Many Relationships <java-field-relationships-many-to-many>`

.. _java-inverse-relationship:

Inverse Relationship
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An **inverse relationship** links an object back to any other objects that refer
to it in a defined to-one or to-many relationship. Relationship definitions are
unidirectional, so you must explicitly define a property in the object's model
as an inverse relationship.

For example, the to-many relationship "User has many Tasks" does not
automatically create the inverse relationship "Task belongs to User". If you
don't specify the inverse relationship in the object model, you would need to
run a separate query to look up the user that is assigned to a given task.

To define an inverse relationship, define a ``LinkingObjects`` property in your
object model. The ``LinkingObjects`` definition specifies the object type and
property name of the relationship that it inverts.

{+client-database+} automatically updates implicit relationships whenever an
object is added or removed in the specified relationship. You cannot manually
set the value of an inverse relationship property.

Fields annotated with ``@LinkingObjects`` must be:

- marked ``final``
- of type ``RealmResults<T>`` where ``T`` is the type at the opposite
  end of the relationship

Since relationships are many-to-one or many-to-many, following inverse
relationships can result in zero, one, or many objects.

Like any other ``RealmResults`` set, you can
:ref:`query <java-client-query-engine>` an inverse relationship.

   :ref:`Usage Example: Inverse Relationships <java-field-relationships-inverse>`

Summary
-------

- A **relationship** is an object property that allows an object to
  reference other objects of the same or another object type.

- Relationships are direct references. You can access related objects
  directly through a relationship property without writing any type of join.

- {+client-database+} supports to-one, to-many, and inverse relationships.

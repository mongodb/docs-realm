Schema Version
--------------

A **schema version** identifies the state of a :ref:`{+backend-schema+}
<java-realm-schema>` at some point in time. {+client-database+} tracks the schema
version of each {+realm+} and uses it to map the objects in each {+realm+}
to the correct schema.

Schema versions are integers that you may include
in the {+realm+} configuration when you open a {+realm+}. If a client
application does not specify a version number when it opens a {+realm+} then
the {+realm+} defaults to version ``0``.

.. important:: Increment Versions Monotonically

   :ref:`Migrations <java-client-migrations>` must update a {+realm+} to a
   higher schema version. {+client-database+} will throw an error if a client
   application opens a {+realm+} with a schema version that is lower than
   the {+realm+}'s current version or if the specified schema version is the
   same as the {+realm+}'s current version but includes different
   :ref:`object schemas <java-object-schema>`.

.. _java-migrations:

Migrations
----------

A **local migration** is a migration for a {+realm+} that does
not automatically :doc:`{+sync-short+} </sync>` with
another {+realm+}. Local migrations have access to the existing
{+backend-schema+}, version, and objects and define logic that
incrementally updates the {+realm+} to its new schema version.
To perform a local migration you must specify a new schema
version that is higher than the current version and provide
a migration function when you open the out-of-date {+realm+}.

With the SDK, you can update underlying data to reflect schema changes
using manual migrations. During such a manual migration, you can
define new and deleted properties when they are added or removed from
your schema. The editable schema exposed via a
:java-sdk:`DynamicRealm <io/realm/DynamicRealm.html>` provides
convenience functions for renaming fields. This gives you full control
over the behavior of your data during complex schema migrations.

.. important:: Migrations During Application Development

   During development of an application, ``RealmObject`` classes can
   change frequently. You can use :java-sdk:`Realm.deleteRealm()
   <io/realm/Realm.html#deleteRealm-io.realm.RealmConfiguration->` to
   delete the database file and eliminate the need to write a full
   migration for testing data.

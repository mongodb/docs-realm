The {+service+} Flutter SDK enables client applications written in 
`Dart <https://dart.dev/>`__ for the `Flutter <https://flutter.dev/>`__ 
platform to access data stored in local {+realm+}s.

Supported Realm Features
------------------------

The alpha version of the SDK supports the following {+realm+} features:

- Create Realm objects
- Retrieve Realm objects
- Update Realm objects
- Query, sort, and filter Realm objects
- Implement change notifications

Alpha Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because this is an alpha version of the SDK, functionality is limited and there 
are specific configuration considerations:

- The alpha version of the SDK enables working with a local-only (on device) 
  Realm database; Realm Sync functionality is not yet implemented.

- The SDK doesn't have built-in functionality to interact with 
  :ref:`{+service+} application services<realm-cloud>`.

.. TODO(DOCSP-20152): Lubo said that the package README will have some additional limitations. 
.. either link to that in the pub.dev version  or copy/paste over content when it's ready

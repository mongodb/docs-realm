   API Reference <https://pub.dev/documentation/realm/latest/>
   Release Notes <https://github.com/realm/realm-dart/releases>


The Realm Flutter SDK enables client applications written in
`Dart <https://dart.dev/>`__ for the `Flutter <https://flutter.dev/>`__
platform to access data stored in realms, sync data with Atlas,
and use Atlas App Services.

Beta Limitations
----------------

Because this is a beta version of the SDK, functionality is limited and there
are specific configuration considerations:

- The beta version of the SDK does not yet have certain Realm database features.
- The SDK doesn't have built-in functionality to interact with all of
  App Services. Learn more about how to :ref:`use the SDK with currently supported App Services
  <flutter-application-services>`.

Develop Apps with Realm Flutter
-------------------------------


.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Use Realm Database Locally
      :tabid: local-realm

      .. container::

         Use Realm Database to persist data on your device.

         .. procedure::

            .. step:: Install the Realm Swift SDK

               Install the Realm Flutter SDK into your project with the
               `realm package on pub.dev <https://pub.dev/packages/realm>`__.

               Import Realm in your project files to get started.

               For more information, see :ref:`Install Realm for Flutter <flutter-install>`.

            .. step:: Define an Object Schema

               Use Dart to define a data schema for your realm database.

               For more information, see :ref:`Define a Realm Object Schema
               <flutter-define-realm-object-schema>`.

            .. step:: Open a Realm

               Open a realm before you begin using it. You can configure it to do things
               like populate initial data on load, be encrypted, and more.

               For more information, see :ref:`Open a Realm <flutter-open-realm>`.

            .. step:: Read and Write Data

               Create, read, update, and delete objects in the realm. You can also
               filter data in your queries using Realm Query Language.

               For more information, see :ref:`Read and Write Data <flutter-read-write-data>`.

            .. step:: React to Changes

               Realm's live objects mean that your data is always up-to-date.
               You can register a notification handler
               to watch for changes and perform logic like updating
               your UI.

               For more information, see :ref:`React to Changes <flutter-react-to-changes>`.

   .. tab:: Sync Data Across Devices
      :tabid: device-sync

      .. container::

         Use Atlas Device Sync to automatically sync data between your app
         and MongoDB Atlas.

         .. procedure::

            .. step:: Configure Atlas Device Sync

               Configure Device Sync in an Atlas App Services App.
               Define data access rules. Use Development Mode to infer your schema
               from your Dart data model.

               For more information, see :ref:`Device Sync Overview <sync-overview>`.

            .. step:: Connect to an Atlas App Services App

               Connect to the App with Device Sync from your
               client before you can sync data

               For more information, :ref:`Connect to App Services <flutter-connect-to-backend>`.

            .. step:: Authenticate a User

               Use one of the App Services authentication providers to authenticate a
               user. App Services includes custom JWT, Facebook, Google, Apple,
               anonymous, and built-in email/password authentication providers.

               For more information, see :ref:`Authenticate Users <flutter-authenticate>`.

            .. step:: Open a Synced Realm

               Configure and open a synced Realm.
               Then, subscribe to a query to determine what data the synced realm
               can read and write.

               For more information, see :ref:`Open a Synced Realm <flutter-open-synced-realm>`.

            .. step:: Read and Write Synced Data

               The APIs to read and write data from a realm are the same
               whether you're using a synced or local realm. Data that you
               read and write is automatically kept in sync with your Atlas
               cluster and other clients. Apps keep working offline and
               sync changes whenever a network connection is available.

      Learn how to add the Realm SDK to your Flutter project.

Dart Standalone Realm
---------------------

In addition to using Realm with Flutter, you can also use Realm with projects
that just use Dart, like a CLI application or web server.

The usage for Realm with Dart is the same as the Flutter SDK, except you must
install and set up a separate package.

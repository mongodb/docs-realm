The Realm Flutter SDK enables client applications written in
`Dart <https://dart.dev/>`__ for the `Flutter <https://flutter.dev/>`__
platform to access data stored in realms, sync data with Atlas,
and use Atlas App Services.

Beta Limitations
----------------

Because this is a beta version of the SDK, functionality is limited and there
are specific configuration considerations:

- The beta version of the SDK does not yet have certain Realm database features.
- The SDK doesn't have built-in functionality to interact with all of
  Atlas App Services. Learn more about how to :ref:`use the SDK with currently supported App Services
  <flutter-application-services>`.

Get Started
-----------

To start using the Atlas App Services Flutter SDK
in your Flutter application, see :ref:`Install Realm for Flutter
<flutter-install>` to add the Flutter SDK
dependency and then check out the :ref:`Quick Start
<flutter-quick-start-local>`.

Dart Standalone Realm
---------------------

In addition to using Realm with Flutter, you can also use Realm with projects
that just use Dart, like a CLI application or web server. 

The usage for Realm with Dart is the same as the Flutter SDK, except you must 
install and set up a separate package.

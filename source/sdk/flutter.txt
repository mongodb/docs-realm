Alpha Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because this is an alpha version of the SDK, functionality is limited and there 
are specific configuration considerations:

- The alpha version of the SDK enables working with a local-only (on device) 
  Realm database; Realm Sync functionality is not yet implemented.

- The SDK doesn't have built-in functionality to interact with 
  :ref:`{+service+} application services<realm-cloud>`.

- The SDK doesn't support Flutter on Linux desktop yet.

Get Started
-----------

To start using the {+service+} Flutter SDK
in your Flutter application, see :ref:`Install Realm for Flutter
<flutter-install>` to add the Flutter SDK
dependency and then check out the :ref:`Quick Start
<flutter-quick-start-local>`.

Dart-Only Realm
---------------

In addition to using Realm with Flutter, you can also use Realm only with Dart,
like a CLI application or web server. 

The usage for Realm with Dart is the same as the Flutter SDK, except you must 
install and set up a separate package. 

:ref:`Learn how to set up Realm in your Dart project. <dart-install-steps>`

The {+service+} Flutter SDK enables client applications written in 
`Dart <https://dart.dev/>`__ for the `Flutter <https://flutter.dev/>`__ 
platform to access data stored in local {+realm+}s.

- Create Realm objects
- Retrieve Realm objects
- Update Realm objects
- Query, sort, and filter Realm objects
- Implement change notifications

.. _flutter_limitations:

Alpha Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because this is an alpha version of the SDK, functionality is limited and there 
are specific configuration considerations:

- The alpha version of the SDK enables working with a local-only (on device) 
  Realm database; Realm Sync functionality is not yet implemented.

- The SDK doesn't have built-in functionality to interact with 
  :ref:`{+service+} application services<realm-cloud>`.

.. TODO(DOCSP-20174): find out if there are other limitations that need documenting
.. the below limitations were in the previous version. confirm w the SDK team if 
.. they're still relevant. 

.. - Flutter Hot Reload is available when running on the Android x86 Emulator and 
..   iOS Simulator.

.. - Running on a physical Android device always includes the libraries in 
..   ``release`` mode.

.. - New projects for iOS can not be created with ``flutter create``. As a workaround, 
..   use the `Realm Flutter and Dart Samples <https://github.com/realm/realm-dart-samples>`__ 
..   and modify the sample project ``provider_shopper``.

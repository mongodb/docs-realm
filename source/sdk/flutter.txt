The {+service+} Flutter SDK enables client applications written in 
`Dart <https://dart.dev/>`__ for the `Flutter <https://flutter.dev/>`__ 
platform to access data stored in local {+realm+}s.

Supported Realm Features
------------------------

The alpha version of the SDK supports the following Realm features:

- Create Realm objects
- Retrieve, query, sort, and filter Realm objects
- Update Realm objects
- Delete Realm objects
- Implement change notifications

Alpha Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because this is an alpha version of the SDK, functionality is limited and there 
are specific configuration considerations:

- The alpha version of the SDK enables working with a local-only (on device) 
  Realm database. Atlas Device Sync functionality is not yet implemented.

- The SDK doesn't have built-in functionality to interact with 
  :ref:`{+service+} application services<realm-cloud>`.

Get Started
-----------

To start using the {+service+} Flutter SDK
in your Flutter application, see :ref:`Install Realm for Flutter
<flutter-install>` to add the Flutter SDK
dependency and then check out the :ref:`Quick Start
<flutter-quick-start-local>`.

Dart Standalone Realm
---------------------

In addition to using Realm with Flutter, you can also use Realm with projects
that just use Dart, like a CLI application or web server. 


The usage for Realm with Dart is the same as the Flutter SDK, except you must 
install and set up a separate package.

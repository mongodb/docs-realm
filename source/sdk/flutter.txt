   Realm SDK for Dart APIs <https://pub.dev/documentation/realm_dart/latest/realm/realm-library.html>

.. versionadded:: 0.1.0+preview

The {+service+} Flutter SDK enables client applications written in 
`Dart <https://dart.dev/>`__ for the `Flutter <https://flutter.dev/>`__ 
platform to access data stored in local {+realms+}.

Supported Realm Features
------------------------
The preview version of the SDK supports the following {+realm+} features:

- creating Realm objects
- retrieving Realm objects
- updating Realm objects
- querying, sorting, and filtering Realm objects
- implementing change notifications

.. _flutter_limitations:

Preview Limitations
-------------------
Because this is a preview version of the SDK, functionality is limited and there 
are specific configuration considerations:

- The preview version of the SDK requires a custom engine based on Flutter 2.0. 
  For more information, and a diff of the changes, see the 
  `runtime diff <https://github.com/realm/realm-dart/tree/preview/runtime>`__
  readme page.

- You cannot use the ``realm_dart`` preview package with the Dart SDK 2.12 shipped 
  with Flutter 2.0. Flutter downloads a custom version of the Dart SDK,
  and this custom version has known problems loading native binaries. Instead, 
  use an official Dart SDK 2.12 installation and ensure it is in your PATH.

- The preview version of the SDK enables working with a local-only (on device) 
  Realm database; Realm Sync functionality is not yet implemented.

- Flutter Hot Reload is available when running on the Android x86 Emulator and 
  iOS Simulator.

- Running on a physical Android device always includes the libraries in 
  ``release`` mode.

- New projects for iOS can not be created with ``flutter create``. As a workaround, 
  use the `Realm Flutter and Dart Samples <https://github.com/realm/realm-dart-samples>`__ 
  and modify the sample project ``provider_shopper``.


.. note:: No Sync Support

   The preview SDK does not support {+sync+}.

Get Started

The `Getting Started <https://pub.dev/packages/realm#getting-started>`__ section 
of the Realm SDK package provides:

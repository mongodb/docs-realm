Flutter SDK (Alpha)

The {+service+} Flutter SDK enables client applications written in 
`Dart <https://dart.dev/>`__ for the `Flutter <https://flutter.dev/>`__ 
platform to access data stored in local {+realm+}s.

.. note:: Local {+client-database+} Only

   The Flutter SDK currently only supports local {+client-database+}.
   You cannot use the SDK to connect to {+service+} backend apps.

Supported Realm Features
------------------------
The alpha version of the SDK supports the following {+realm+} features:

- creating Realm objects
- retrieving Realm objects
- updating Realm objects
- querying, sorting, and filtering Realm objects
- implementing change notifications

.. _flutter_limitations:

Alpha Limitations
-----------------
Because this is an alpha version of the SDK, functionality is limited and there 
are specific configuration considerations:

- The alpha version of the SDK requires a custom engine based on Flutter 2.0. 
  For a :wikipedia:`diff <Diff>` of the changes and additional information, see the 
  `runtime diff <https://github.com/realm/realm-dart/tree/preview/runtime>`__
  readme page.

- You cannot use the ``realm_dart`` alpha package with the Dart SDK 2.12 shipped 
  with Flutter 2.0. Flutter downloads a custom version of the Dart SDK,
  and this custom version has known problems loading native binaries. Instead, 
  use an official Dart SDK 2.12 installation and ensure it is in your PATH.

- The alpha version of the SDK enables working with a local-only (on device) 
  Realm database; Realm Sync functionality is not yet implemented.

- Flutter Hot Reload is available when running on the Android x86 Emulator and 
  iOS Simulator.

- Running on a physical Android device always includes the libraries in 
  ``release`` mode.

- New projects for iOS can not be created with ``flutter create``. As a workaround, 
  use the `Realm Flutter and Dart Samples <https://github.com/realm/realm-dart-samples>`__ 
  and modify the sample project ``provider_shopper``.

Get Started
-----------
The `Getting Started <https://pub.dev/packages/realm#getting-started>`__ section 
of the Realm SDK package provides:

- The steps necessary to import Realm into a Flutter project 

- Code snippets for writing to and reading from the {+realm+}.

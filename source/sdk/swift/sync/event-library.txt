Overview
--------

The Event Library enables you to track a user's activity while using a 
Sync-enabled mobile application. The Event Library can record read and
write transactions. Developers can also configure custom events to record
button presses, the data displayed in the UI, or other important details.

When you use the Event Library, you can specify the events you want to 
record. This means opening two realms: 

- The user realm, where the user does the reading and writing in the 
  client application
- The event realm, where the Event Library records scoped and custom events

The data from both realms syncs to your App Services App. The client 
user never interacts directly with the event realm or its data; and 
the event realm Sync user can even be different from the user 
realm.

Because the Event Library generates a large amount of data:

- The client device must have enough capacity to store the data
- Expect Device Sync usage for the event realm to be higher than the reading
  and writing in the user realm
- The App's backing Atlas cluster must have enough storage 
  capacity to handle the data generated by the Event Library

Before You Begin
----------------

The Event Library stores data in an ``AuditEvent`` collection in your 
linked Atlas data source. Enable :ref:`Development Mode <enable-development-mode>`
in your App Services App to let Atlas create the collection and infer
the schema from the uploaded events.

Enable Event Recording
----------------------

To enable event recording, set the :swift-sdk:`Event.Configuration 
<Structs/Realm/Configuration.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V13ConfigurationV05eventC0AA05EventC0VSgvp>` 
property on the :swift-sdk:`Realm.Configuration <Structs/Realm/Configuration.html>`.

You can initialize the ``EventConfiguration`` in either of two ways:

- Use the default-initialized configuration when you don't need to specify details
- Pass additional parameters to customize the event configuration

Default Event Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you don't need to specify particular parameters, you can use the 
default-initialized ``EventConfiguration``:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/EventLibrary.snippet.default-event-configuration.swift
   :language: swift

Pass Parameters to Event Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can pass optional parameters to customize the ``EventConfiguration``:

- ``metadata``: String dictionary of metadata fields to append to each event
- ``syncUser``: The user to use for syncing event realm(s). If nil, defaults 
  to the user from the ``Realm.Configuration``.
- ``partitionPrefix``: String prefix to append to the event partition value
- ``logger``: Custom logger to use for events. If nil, defaults to the
  logger from the user realm.
- ``errorHandler``: Custom error handler to use when opening the event realm. 
  If nil, defaults to the error handler from the user realm.

.. _swift-event-library-record-events:

Record Events
-------------

Interact with the Event Realm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After you define your event configuration, you can invoke the event recording 
functionality with the new :swift-sdk:`events <Structs/Events.html>` property 
on a :swift-sdk:`realm <Structs/Realm.html>`. This returns an ``Event`` 
instance tied to that realm.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/EventLibrary.snippet.invoke-event-realm.swift
   :language: swift

Record Read or Write Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Event Library records read and write events within the context of 
a scope. The scope is the period during which the Event Library watches 
for and records realm activities. You can set different scopes to record
different types of events. For example, you might have scopes for specific
user flows such as "login", different scopes for different screens, or 
different scopes for specific compliance-related activities.

Use :swift-sdk:`beginScope(activity: "some activity") 
<Structs/Events.html#/s:10RealmSwift6EventsV10beginScope8activityySS_tF>` 
to begin recording a new event with the given activity name. This records 
activities that occur within the scope of the event as read or write events.

- Read events: run queries and instantiate objects. When the scope ends, 
  the event realm records these activities as read events.
- Write events: modify objects. When the scope ends, the event realm records
  the initial state of the object, as well as the new values of any 
  properties that change durign the scope of the event.

Using ``beginScope`` to record an event opens the event realm if it 
is not already open. The SDK opens event realms on the background 
thread and reports errors to the error callback.

Use :swift-sdk:`endScope() 
<Structs/Events.html#/s:10RealmSwift6EventsV8endScope7Combine6FutureCyyts5Error_pGyF>` 
to finish recording the event. When you end the recording, the Event Library 
saves the event to disk locally. Then, if the device has a network connection, 
the SDK asynchronously sends the data to the server.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/EventLibrary.snippet.record-read-and-write-events.swift
   :language: swift

You can pass an optional completion block to :swift-sdk:`endScope() 
<Structs/Events.html#/s:10RealmSwift6EventsV8endScope10completionyys5Error_pSgcSg_tF>` 
when you finish recording. The SDK calls this block when the event data 
has been successfully persisted - not when the event realm upload has completed.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/EventLibrary.snippet.scoped-event-with-completion.swift
   :language: swift

Record Custom Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Event Library lets you record button clicks or other events that do not
involve database reads and writes. Use :swift-sdk:`recordEvent 
<Structs/Events.html#/s:10RealmSwift6EventsV11recordEvent8activity9eventType4data10completionySS_SSSgAIys5Error_pSgcSgtF>`
to record a custom event. This function takes these parameters:

- ``activity``: the activity name. This is an arbitrary string, such as 
  "user registration."
- ``eventType``: the type of event. This is an arbitrary string, such as 
  "pressed Submit button."
- ``data``: an optional data payload for the event. 
- ``completion``: an optional completion handler. The Event Library calls 
  this completion block once the event has been saved to the event 
  realm, or if an error occurs. A nil error indicates success.

A custom event doesn't have a scope like read and write events. Instead,
recording a custom event is more analogous to firing a trigger.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/EventLibrary.snippet.record-custom-events.swift
   :language: swift

Event Object Serialization
--------------------------

JSON Object Serialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Event Library converts each event object to a JSON object. Most
:ref:`Realm Database types <ios-supported-property-types>` have an 
analogous JSON representation. For example, a Realm Database 
String property becomes a JSON String.

This is how the Event Library represents the types that do not have a direct 
JSON analog:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Date
     - Encoded to a string in :wikipedia:`ISO 8601-1:2019 format <ISO_8601>`.
   * - Data
     - Excluded entirely from the event.
   * - UUID
     - Encoded to a :rfc:`4122`-compliant string.
   * - ObjectID
     - Encoded to our :manual:`ObjectID <reference/method/ObjectId>` string representation.
   * - Decimal128
     - Encoded to a string, not a number. JSON numbers are officially infinite-
       precision, but are rarely actually implemented as such.
   * - List
     - Encoded as an array.
   * - Set
     - Encoded as an array.
   * - Dictionary
     - Encoded as an object.
   * - Embedded objects
     - Encoded as an object.

Non-embedded object links are encoded as the primary key of the target. In
read events, if the link is followed, this expands to the full object. If
the link is not followed, this remains a primary key.

Customize Event Serialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can customize JSON serialization for event objects. To customize
the event payload, use the :swift-sdk:`CustomEventRepresentable 
<Protocols/CustomEventRepresentable.html>` protocol.

When an object conforms to ``CustomEventRepresentable``, the Event Library 
serializes objects by:

- Constructing an accessor object
- Calling ``customEventRepresentation`` on that accessor object
- Serializing the result instead of the original object

To conform to ``CustomEventRepresentable``, your object must implement a
:swift-sdk:`customEventRepresentation 
<Protocols/CustomEventRepresentable.html#/c:@M@RealmSwift@objc(pl)RLMCustomEventRepresentable(im)customEventRepresentation>` 
function that defines your customized serialization.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/EventLibrary.snippet.custom-event-representable.swift
   :language: swift

Event Realm File Size
---------------------

The event realm can grow quite large if the device is offline for an 
extended time. 

To compensate for this, the Event Library automatically splits event data 
into multiple partitions as needed. When a partition reaches its maximum 
size, the Event Library closes the event realm and automatically begins 
writing to a new partition.

The Event Library checks whether the user has any unsynced partitions. If 
they do, the Event Library opens one, uploads the data, and then closes 
the file and deletes it. This repeats until the user has no unsynced 
partitions.

Event Library Reference
-----------------------

Events
~~~~~~

An event object contains:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 20 60

   * - Type of Event
     - ``event``
     - Optional string. ``read`` or ``write`` for scoped events, or
       an arbitrary string for custom events.

   * - Event Scope
     - ``scope``
     - Optional string. The scope name passed to ``beginScope()`` to begin
       recording the event, or an arbitrary string for custom events.

   * - Timestamp
     - ``timestamp``
     - Device local time when the event scope is ended and the 
       data is committed, *or* the time when the event hits the server.

   * - Data
     - ``data``
     - The event payload. This is a JSON blob for scoped events, or an 
       arbitrary string for custom events.

   * - Metadata
     - ``metadata key`` (string)
     - An optional metadata dictionary. When this dictionary contains keys 
       and values, the key becomes a field name in the event object, and
       the value is stored in that field for every event.

Event Payload
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each event contains a payload in the ``data`` property that captures
the current state of the objects being read or written to.

Payloads for custom events can be whatever the developer desires, including nil.

.. important::

   Because the payload captures the current state of the objects being read or
   written to, this produces a very large amount of data. However, this must 
   be done on the client rather than the server, as the exact data that the
   user views may never exist server-side. In practice, this means that the
   device must have the capacity to store a large amount of data if it goes
   offline. Additionally, Device Sync usage for the event realm may be much 
   higher than for the reading and writing the user does in the user
   realm.

.. example::

   In our :ref:`Record Events <swift-event-library-record-events>` examples
   above, these are the ``data`` payloads for the read and write events:

   .. code-block:: json
      :caption: Read Event Payload

      {
        "type":"Person",
        "value": [{
          "_id":"62b38b3c10846041166f5deb",
          "_partition":"",
          "employeeId":2,
          "name":"Anthony",
          "userId":null
        }]
      }

   .. code-block:: json
      :caption: Write Event Payload

      {
        "Person": {
          "modifications": [{
            "newValue": {
              "name":"Tony"
            },
            "oldValue":{
              "_id":"62b38b3c10846041166f5deb",
              "_partition":"",
              "employeeId":2,
              "name":"Anthony",
              "userId":null
            }
          }]
        }
      }

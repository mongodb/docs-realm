Key Concept: Synced Realms
--------------------------

You can configure a realm to automatically synchronize data between many devices
that each have their own local copy of the data. Synced realms use a different
configuration than local-only realms and require an Atlas App Services 
backend to handle the synchronization process. 

Applications can always create, modify, and delete synced realm objects locally,
even when offline. Whenever a network connection is available, the Realm SDK
opens a connection to an application server and syncs changes to and from other
clients. The :ref:`Atlas Device Sync protocol <sync-protocol>` and server-side
operational transforms guarantee that all fully synced instances of a realm see
exactly the same data, even if some changes occurred offline and/or were
received out of order.

.. tip:: Learn How to Configure and Use Sync
   
   For more information on Device Sync, including directions on how to
   set up sync in an App Services app, see :ref:`ios-realm-sync`.

Synced Realms vs. Non-Synced Realms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Synced {+realms+} differ from non-synced local {+client-database+} in a 
few ways:

- Synced {+realms+} attempt to sync changes with your backend Atlas App Services App,
  whereas non-synced {+realms+} do not.
- Synced {+realms+} can be accessed by authenticated users, while non-synced 
  {+realms+} have no concept of users or authentication.
- With synced {+realms+}, you can :ref:`specify the download behavior 
  <ios-specify-download-behavior>` to download updates before opening a 
  {+realm+}. However, requiring changes to download before opening the 
  realm requires the user to be online. Non-synced {+realms+} can always 
  be used offline.

You can copy data from a non-synced {+client-database+} to a synced {+realm+}, 
and vice versa, but you cannot sync a non-synced {+client-database+}.

.. _convert-realm-sync:

Convert Between Synced and Non-Synced Realms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Realm does not have a direct mechanism to add sync to a non-synced realm, 
or to permanently stop Sync for a synced realm. However, the Swift SDK does 
provide methods that enable you to copy a realm file for use with a different 
configuration. With these methods, you can easily duplicate a realm's data, 
which you can then open with a sync or non-sync configuration. This lets
you indirectly add Sync to a non-synced realm, or permanently stop a realm
from syncing. See:

- :ref:`<ios-open-non-synced-as-synced-realm>`
- :ref:`<ios-open-synced-realm-as-non-sync>`

.. _ios-login-and-open-realm:

Open a Synced Realm
-------------------

.. seealso::

   The examples on this page describe how to work with synced {+realms+} in
   Swift SDK versions newer than 10.15.0. For older SDK versions, or if 
   you're building apps for iOS targets prior to 15.0, with Swift 
   versions older than 5.5, see: :ref:`Legacy Sync Open Methods 
   <ios-realm-open-legacy>`. 

The typical flow for opening a synced {+realm+} involves:

1. :ref:`Authenticating the user <ios-authenticate-users>`.
#. Creating a sync configuration.
#. Opening the user's synced {+realm+} with the configuration.

At authentication, we cache user credentials in a ``sync_metadata.realm`` 
file on device.

When you open a synced {+realm+} after authenticating, you can bypass the 
login flow and go directly to opening the synced {+realm+}, using the same 
sync configuration you already created.

With cached credentials, you can:

- Open a synced {+realm+} immediately with the data that is on the device.
  You can use this method offline or online.
- Open a synced {+realm+} after downloading changes from your Atlas App Services {+app+}. 
  This requires the user to have an active internet connection.

.. _ios-partition-based-sync-open-realm:

Open a Synced Realm for Partition-Based Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Initialize a synced {+realm+} with a :swift-sdk:`sync configuration <Extensions/User.html#/s:So7RLMUserC10RealmSwiftE13configuration14partitionValueAC0B0V13ConfigurationVx_tAC4BSONRzlF>`.
This enables you to specify a partition value whose data should sync to the realm.

      .. seealso::
         
         The Realm Swift SDK supports async/await syntax for opening a realm. 
         For completion handler syntax, see:
         :ref:`ios-realm-open-legacy`. 

         .. include:: /includes/swift-async-await-support.rst

      Pass a logged-in user's :swift-sdk:`configuration <Structs/Realm/Configuration.html>` 
      object with the desired :ref:`partition value <partition-value>` to 
      :swift-sdk:`{+realm+} initializers 
      <Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V13configuration5queueA2C13ConfigurationV_So012OS_dispatch_D0CSgtKcfc>`.

      You can optionally :ref:`specify whether a {+realm+} should download 
      changes before opening <ios-specify-download-behavior>`. If you do not
      specify download behavior, this opens a {+realm+} with data that is on
      the device, and attempts to sync changes in the background.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Sync.snippet.open-synced-realm.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      The first time you log in and open a synced {+realm+}, you'll log in the
      user, and pass the user's :objc-sdk:`RLMSyncConfiguration 
      <Classes/RLMRealmConfiguration.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMRealmConfiguration(py)syncConfiguration>` 
      object with the desired :objc-sdk:`partitionValue 
      <Classes/RLMSyncConfiguration.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMSyncConfiguration(py)partitionValue>` 
      to :objc-sdk:`+[RLMRealm realmWithConfiguration:error:]
      <Classes/RLMRealm.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMRealm(cm)realmWithConfiguration:error:>`.

      This opens a synced {+realm+} on the device. The {+realm+} 
      attempts to sync with your {+app+} in the background to check for changes 
      on the server, or upload changes that the user has made.

.. _ios-flexible-sync-open-realm:

Open a Synced Realm for Flexible Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 10.22.0

When you use Flexible Sync, use the ``flexibleSyncConfiguration()``
to open a synced realm. 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/FlexibleSync.snippet.flex-sync-open-realm.swift
   :language: swift

.. important:: Flexible Sync Requires a Subscription

   You can't use a Flexible Sync realm until you add at least one subscription.
   To learn how to add subscriptions, see: :ref:`<ios-sync-add-subscription>`.
   
.. _ios-open-synced-realm-as-different-sync-user:

Open a Synced Realm as a Different Sync User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 10.23.0

If you want to open a synced realm as a different Sync user, you can use 
the :swift-sdk:`writeCopy(configuration: ) 
<Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V9writeCopy13configurationyAC13ConfigurationV_tKF>` 
method to make a copy of the synced realm for use with the new user's 
sync configuration. The example below creates a copy of the synced realm, 
with all of its existing data, that you can use with a different sync 
configuration.

After you copy the realm for the new Sync user's configuration, you can 
open the copy as a synced realm for that user. 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ConvertSyncLocalRealms.snippet.convert-sync-to-sync.swift
   :language: swift

.. _ios-open-non-synced-as-synced-realm:

Open Non-Synced Realm as a Synced Realm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 10.23.0

If you want a non-synced realm to start syncing with other devices and your 
Atlas App Services backend, you can use the :swift-sdk:`writeCopy(configuration: ) 
<Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V9writeCopy13configurationyAC13ConfigurationV_tKF>` 
method to make a copy of the non-synced realm for use with a sync configuration. 
The example below creates a copy of a non-synced realm file, with all of 
its existing data, that you can use with a sync configuration.

After you copy the realm for use with Sync, you can open the copy as a 
synced realm. Any changes you make to the synced realm will reflect 
in the synced realm file, and they will also propogate to other devices and
the Atlas App Services backend.

   :language: swift

.. _ios-open-synced-realm-as-non-sync:

Open a Synced Realm as a Non-Synced Realm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 10.23.0

.. tip::

   You may temporarily pause a Sync session if you do not want to permanently
   change a synced realm to a non-synced realm. See: :ref:`Suspend or Resume 
   a Sync Session <ios-suspend-or-resume-a-sync-session>`.

If you want to permanently stop a realm from syncing to your Atlas App Services backend,
you can use the :swift-sdk:`writeCopy(configuration: ) 
<Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V9writeCopy13configurationyAC13ConfigurationV_tKF>` 
method to make a copy of a synced realm for use with a non-sync configuration.
The example below creates a copy of the realm file, with all of its existing 
data, at a file URL you specify. 

This process removes the ``realm_id`` in the local realm. You must :ref:`increment 
the schema version as if you had deleted a property <ios-delete-a-property>`.

After you copy the realm for use without Sync, you can open the copy as a 
non-synced realm. Any changes you make to the non-synced realm reflect 
only in the local realm file. No changes propogate to other devices or
the Atlas App Services backend.

.. _ios-specify-download-behavior:

Download Changes Before Open
----------------------------

.. versionadded:: 10.15.0

When you open a synced {+realm+} with the Swift SDK, you can pass the 
``downloadBeforeOpen`` parameter to specify whether to download the 
changeset from your Atlas App Services {+app+} before opening the {+realm+}. 
This parameter accepts a case from the ``OpenBehavior`` enum:

- ``never``: Immediately open the {+realm+} on the device. Download changes 
  in the background when the user has internet, but don't block opening
  the {+realm+}.
- ``always``: Check for changes every time you open the {+realm+}.
  Requires the user to have an active internet connection.
- ``once``: Download data before opening a {+realm+} for the first time, but
  open it without downloading changes on subsequent opens. This lets you 
  populate a {+realm+} with initial data, but enables offline-first 
  functionality on subsequent opens.

.. include:: /examples/generated/code/start/Sync.snippet.specify-download-behavior.swift.rst

.. _ios-open-a-synced-realm-offline:

Open a Synced Realm Offline
---------------------------

.. include:: /includes/offline-login.rst

You can only open a synced realm offline if you do not require your client 
app to ``always`` :ref:`download changes before opening the realm 
<ios-specify-download-behavior>`.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Authenticate.snippet.offline-login.swift

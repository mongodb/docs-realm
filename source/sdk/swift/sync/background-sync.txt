Sync Changes in the Background
------------------------------

If you want your app to update data in the background (while the app is
minimized), iOS requires you to implement :apple:`Background App Refresh
<documentation/uikit/app_and_environment/scenes/preparing_your_ui_to_run_in_the_background/updating_your_app_with_background_app_refresh>`.
Enabling Background App Refresh minimizes the time it takes for the user
to see the most recent data; without Background App Refresh, {+service+}
updates the data when the user launches the app, potentially resulting
in noticeable lag.

To use the {+realm+} while the device is locked, you must adjust the
file protection settings. See
:ref:`use-realm-when-the-device-is-locked`.

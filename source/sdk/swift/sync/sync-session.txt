Opening a synced realm starts a :swift-sdk:`SyncSession <Extensions/SyncSession.html>`
for that realm. The Realm Swift SDK provides methods to manually pause 
and resume a sync session.

Sync Connection Behavior
------------------------

.. versionadded:: 10.41.0

In Realm Swift SDK version 10.41.0 and later, App Services defaults to 
sharing a single connection to the server for all opened synced realms. 
This is a change from earlier versions where opening more than one synced 
realm opened additional connections to the server. The connection to the 
server is independent of the ``SyncSession``, and is based on the App 
Services user.

You can change this behavior from the :ref:`App client configuration 
<ios-init-appclient>`.

Suspend or Resume a Sync Session
--------------------------------

You can suspend and resume the sync session on the realm.
Pausing a sync session only suspends that realm's sync session. If you have
more than one open realm, suspend does not affect the sync sessions for 
other realms.

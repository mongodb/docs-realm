Opening a synced realm starts a :swift-sdk:`SyncSession <Extensions/SyncSession.html>`
for that realm. The Realm Swift SDK provides methods to manually pause 
and resume a sync session.

Sync Connection Behavior
------------------------

.. versionadded:: 10.41.0

In Realm Swift SDK version 10.41.0 and later, App Services defaults to 
sharing a single connection to the server for all opened synced realms. 
This is a change from earlier versions where opening more than one synced 
realm opened additional connections to the server. The connection to the 
server is independent of the ``SyncSession``, and is based on the App 
Services user.

You can change this behavior from the :ref:`App client configuration 
<ios-init-appclient>`.

Suspend or Resume a Sync Session
--------------------------------

You can suspend and resume the sync session on the realm.
Pausing a sync session only suspends that realm's sync session. If you have
more than one open realm, suspend does not affect the sync sessions for 
other realms.

      :tabid: swift

      You can suspend or resume a sync session using the
      :swift-sdk:`SyncSession <Extensions/SyncSession.html>` instance of
      a synced realm.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Sync.snippet.pause-resume-sync-session.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      You can suspend or resume a sync session using the
      :objc-sdk:`RLMSyncSession <Classes/RLMSyncSession.html>` instance
      of a synced realm.

Check Upload & Download Progress for a Sync Session
---------------------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/flex-sync-unsupported-progress-notifications.rst

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      You can add a progress notification using the synced realm's
      SyncSession instance's
      :swift-sdk:`addProgressNotification(for:mode:block:)
      <Extensions/SyncSession.html#/s:So14RLMSyncSessionC10RealmSwiftE23addProgressNotification3for4mode5blockSo011RLMProgressG5TokenCSgAbCE0F9DirectionO_AbCE0F4ModeOyAbCE0F0VctF>`
      method.

      This method returns a token that you should retain until you wish
      to stop observing upload or download progress. Note that if you
      keep the token in a local variable, observation will stop when the
      local variable goes out of scope.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Sync.snippet.check-progress.swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      You can add a progress notification using the synced realm's
      RLMSyncSession instance's
      :objc-sdk:`[--addProgressNotificationForDirection:mode:block:]
      <Classes/RLMSyncSession.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMSyncSession(im)addProgressNotificationForDirection:mode:block:>`
      method.

      This method returns a token that you should retain until you wish
      to stop observing upload or download progress. Note that if you
      keep the token in a local variable, observation will stop when the

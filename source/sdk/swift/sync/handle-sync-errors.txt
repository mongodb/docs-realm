Handle Sync Errors
------------------

While developing an application that uses Device Sync, you should set an error
handler. This error handler will detect and respond to any failed sync-related
API calls. 

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      Set an error handler on the :swift-sdk:`SyncManager
      <Typealiases.html#/s:10RealmSwift11SyncManagera>` singleton. Set an error
      handler on the SyncManager singleton. When an error occurs, the Swift SDK
      calls the error handler with the error object and the :swift-sdk:`SyncSession
      <Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V11syncSessionSo07RLMSyncD0CSgvp>` that the
      error occurred on.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      Set an error handler on the :objc-sdk:`RLMSyncManager
      <objc/latest/Classes/RLMSyncManager.html>` singleton. When an error
      occurs, the Swift SDK calls the error handler with the error object and the
      :objc-sdk:`RLMSyncSession <objc/latest/Classes/RLMSyncSession.html>` that
      the error occurred on.

      .. note::
   
         Realm represents sync errors through :objc-sdk:`NSError <Categories/NSError%28RLMSync%29.html>` objects whose domain is
         :objc-sdk:`RLMSyncErrorDomain <Constants.html#/c:@RLMSyncErrorDomain>`. To learn more about the error codes, check out
         the definitions of :objc-sdk:`RLMSyncError <Enums/RLMSyncError.html>` and :objc-sdk:`RLMSyncAuthError <Enums/RLMSyncAuthError.html>`.

.. _ios-client-reset:

Client Reset
------------

When using :ref:`Device Sync <sync>`, a **client reset** is an
error recovery task that your client app must perform in the following
situation:

- The given synced realm on the server was restored from a backup.

- The client app made changes to that realm since the backup was made,
  but did not sync those changes back to the server before the server
  was restored.

In other words, the client app must carry out a client reset on a given
synced realm if the server is restored to a version older than the
version on the client.

For more information about what might cause a client reset to occur, see:
:ref:`client-resets`.

.. _ios-automatic-vs-manual-client-reset:

Automatic vs. Manual Client Reset
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Realm SDKs provide :ref:`client reset modes <ios-specify-client-reset-mode>` 
that automatically handle most client reset errors. Automatic client 
reset modes restore your local realm file to a syncable state without 
closing the realm or missing notifications. 

All the client reset modes except ``.manual`` perform an automatic client 
reset. The differences between the modes are based on how they handle 
changes on the device that have not yet synced to the backend.

Choose ``.recoverUnsyncedChanges`` to handle most client reset 
scenarios automatically. This attempts to recover unsynced changes when a 
client reset occurs.

In some cases, you may want or need to :ref:`set a manual client reset handler 
<ios-manual-client-reset-handler>`. You may want to do this if your app 
requires specific client reset logic that can't be handled automatically.

.. _ios-specify-client-reset-mode:

Specify a Client Reset Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 10.32.0. Client recovery added, discardLocal name changed

The Swift SDK provides the option to specify a client 
reset mode in your :swift-sdk:`SyncConfiguration 
<Structs/SyncConfiguration.html>`. This is the :swift-sdk:`.clientResetMode 
<Structs/SyncConfiguration.html#/s:10RealmSwift17SyncConfigurationV15clientResetModeAA06ClientfG0Ovp>`
property. 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ClientReset.snippet.specify-client-reset-mode.swift
   :language: swift

This property takes :swift-sdk:`an enum representing the different client 
reset modes <Enums/ClientResetMode.html>`: 

- ``.recoverUnsyncedChanges``
- ``.recoverOrDiscardUnsyncedChanges``
- ``.discardUnsyncedChanges`` 
- ``.manual``

If you do not specify ``.clientResetMode`` in your configuration, the client 
reset mode defaults to ``.recoverUnsyncedChanges``.

You can specify a ``before`` and ``after`` block to execute during the automatic client 
reset process. You might use this to perform recovery logic that is important 
to your application.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ClientReset.snippet.client-reset-with-blocks.swift
   :language: swift

If your app has specific client recovery needs, you 
can specify the ``.manual`` client reset mode and set a :ref:`manual client
reset handler <ios-manual-client-reset-handler>`. You might do this if 
you have specific custom logic your app must perform during a client reset,
or if the :ref:`client recovery rules <ios-client-recovery-rules>` do not 
work for your app.

.. note:: 
   
   If your app uses Swift SDK version 10.24.2 or earlier, ``.clientResetMode`` 
   is not an available property on the ``SyncConfiguration``.

.. _ios-handle-schema-changes:

Handle Schema Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Client Recovery <enable-or-disable-recovery-mode>` is a feature that is
enabled by default when you :ref:`configure Device Sync <enable-sync>`. When 
Client Recovery is enabled, Realm Database can automatically manage the 
client reset process in most cases. When you make schema changes:

- The client can :ref:`recover unsynced changes <ios-recover-unsynced-changes>` 
  when there are no schema changes, or non-breaking schema changes.
- When you make breaking schema changes, you must set a :ref:`manual client 
  reset handler <ios-manual-client-reset-handler>`. Automatic client recovery
  cannot occur when your app makes breaking schema changes.

For information on breaking vs. non-breaking schema changes, see: 
:ref:`breaking-change-quick-reference`.

.. _ios-recover-unsynced-changes:

Recover Unsynced Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 10.32.0

During a client reset, client applications can attempt to recover data 
in the local realm that has not yet synced to the backend. To recover 
unsynced changes, :ref:`Client Recovery <recover-unsynced-changes>` must 
be :ref:`enabled in your App Services App <enable-or-disable-recovery-mode>`, 
as it is by default.

If you want your app to recover changes that have not yet synced, set 
the :swift-sdk:`.clientResetMode 
<Structs/SyncConfiguration.html#/s:10RealmSwift17SyncConfigurationV15clientResetModeAA06ClientfG0Ovp>`
in the :swift-sdk:`SyncConfiguration <Structs/SyncConfiguration.html>` to 
one of:

- ``.recoverUnsyncedChanges``: When you choose this mode, the client attempts 
  to recover unsynced changes. If there are breaking schema changes, the 
  client cannot execute an automatic recovery and instead falls 
  through to ``.manual``. Choose this mode when you do not want to fall
  through to discard unsynced changes. 
- ``.recoverOrDiscardUnsyncedChanges``: The client first attempts to recover 
  changes that have not yet synced. If the client cannot recover unsynced 
  data, it falls through to :ref:`discard unsynced changes 
  <ios-discard-local-changes>` but continues to automatically perform the 
  client reset. If there are breaking schema changes, the client cannot 
  execute an automatic recovery and instead falls through to ``.manual``. 
  Choose this mode when you want to enable automatic client recovery to 
  fall back to discard unsynced changes. 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ClientReset.snippet.specify-client-reset-mode.swift
   :language: swift

If the client reset operation cannot complete in recover unsynced changes mode, 
as in when there are breaking schema changes, the client reset process falls 
through to ``.manual`` mode. You can set an error handler for this fall
through case via the :swift-sdk:`SyncManager 
<Typealiases.html#/s:10RealmSwift11SyncManagera>`:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ClientReset.snippet.manual-fallback-error-handler.swift
   :language: swift

.. _ios-client-recovery-rules:

Client Recovery Rules
`````````````````````

.. include:: /includes/client-recovery-rules.rst

.. _ios-discard-local-changes:

Discard Unsynced Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionchanged:: 10.32.0. .discardLocal changed to .discardUnsyncedChanges

The **discard unsynced changes** client reset mode permanently deletes all 
local unsynced changes made since the last successful sync. You might 
use this mode when your app requires client recovery logic that is not 
consistent with the Device Sync :ref:`Client Recovery Rules 
<ios-client-recovery-rules>`, or when you don't want to recover unsynced data.

Do not use discard unsynced changes mode if your application cannot lose local 
data that has not yet synced to the backend.

To perform an automatic client reset that discards unsynced changes, set 
the :swift-sdk:`.clientResetMode 
<Structs/SyncConfiguration.html#/s:10RealmSwift17SyncConfigurationV15clientResetModeAA06ClientfG0Ovp>`
in the :swift-sdk:`SyncConfiguration <Structs/SyncConfiguration.html>` to 
one of:

- ``.recoverOrDiscardUnsyncedChanges``: When you choose this mode, the 
  client attempts to recover unsynced changes. If the client cannot recover 
  unsynced data, it instead falls through to discard it. This enables your 
  app to complete the automatic client reset without any manual handling 
  except in the event of breaking schema changes. Choose this mode when 
  you want to first attempt to recover unsynced changes. 
- ``.discardUnsyncedChanges``: You might prefer to discard changes by default
  if the :ref:`Client Recovery Rules <ios-client-recovery-rules>` do not 
  work for your app's logic. Choose this mode when you do not want to 
  attempt to recover unsynced changes, but do want to automatically recover
  from a client reset error.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ClientReset.snippet.specify-discard.swift
   :language: swift

If the client reset operation cannot complete in discard unsynced changes mode, 
like when there are breaking schema changes, the client reset process falls
back to ``.manual`` mode. You can set an error handler for this fallback 
case via the :swift-sdk:`SyncManager 
<Typealiases.html#/s:10RealmSwift11SyncManagera>`:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ClientReset.snippet.manual-fallback-error-handler.swift
   :language: swift

.. _ios-manual-client-reset-handler:
.. _ios-manual-mode:

Manual Client Reset
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you specify ``.manual`` for ``.clientResetMode``, or if your app makes
breaking schema changes, you should implement a manual client reset handler.

In ``.manual`` mode, you define your own client reset handler. The handler 
can take an ``ErrorReportingBlock``. We recommend using the
:ref:`automatic client recovery modes <ios-automatic-vs-manual-client-reset>` 
when possible, and treating the manual handler as a tool for fatal error 
recovery situations where you advise users to update the app or perform 
some other action. 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ClientReset.snippet.specify-manual.swift
   :language: swift

.. tip::

   If you are using an older version of the SDK, and want to see an example of 
   how you might manually recover changes in a manual client reset, check out
   this :github:`example on GitHub
   <mongodb/realm-practice/blob/main/swift/RealmPractice/Classes/ViewController.swift#L286>`.

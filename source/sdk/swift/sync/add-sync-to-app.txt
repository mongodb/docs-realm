   This page contains information about how to add Device Sync to an app.
   If you are looking for information about what Device Sync is and how it 
   works, see: :ref:`Application Services: Sync Data <ios-realm-sync>`.

.. _ios-open-a-synced-realm:

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you can access a synced realm from the client, you must 
:ref:`Enable sync <enable-sync>` in the App Services UI.

Add Device Sync to a Client Application
---------------------------------------

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Connect to the App Services backend

      Pass the App ID for your App, which you can :ref:`find in the Realm UI
      <find-your-app-id>`.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/RealmApp.snippet.init-realm-app-client.swift
         :language: swift

   .. step:: Authenticate a user

      :ref:`Authenticate a user <ios-authenticate-users>` in your client 
      project. Here, we'll use :ref:`anonymous authentication 
      <ios-login-anonymous>`. 

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Authenticate.snippet.async-await.swift
         :language: swift

   .. step:: Open a Synced Realm

      Open the realm as a :ref:`synced realm <ios-login-and-open-realm>`.
      You can specify whether a synced realm should download data before 
      it opens. Here, we use a :ref:`Flexible Sync configuration 
      <ios-flexible-sync-open-realm>` and specify that the SDK
      should always download the most recent updates before opening the realm.
      We also :ref:`specify the object types 
      <ios-provide-a-subset-of-classes-to-a-realm>` that we want to 
      include in this realm.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/FlexibleSync.snippet.flex-sync-open-realm.swift
         :language: swift

      If you're using :ref:`Flexible Sync <sync-modes-flexible-sync>` 
      in your app, you'll also need to :ref:`add subscriptions 
      <swift-manage-flexible-sync-subscriptions>` before you can open the 
      realm. Here, we'll :ref:`check to see whether a subscription already 
      exists <ios-check-existing-subscriptions-before-adding>` before adding it:

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/FlexibleSync.snippet.check-before-adding-subscription.swift
         :language: swift

Use the Realm
-------------

The syntax to :ref:`read <ios-read-operations>`, :ref:`write
<ios-write-operations>`, and
:ref:`watch for changes <ios-react-to-changes>` on a
synced realm is identical to the syntax for non-synced realms. While 
you work with local data, a background thread efficiently integrates, 
uploads, and downloads changesets.

The following code creates a new ``Task`` object and writes it to the realm:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/CompleteQuickStart.snippet.create-task.swift
   :language: swift

.. important:: When Using Sync, Avoid Writes on the Main Thread

   The fact that Realm performs sync integrations on a background thread means
   that if you write to your realm on the main thread, there's a small chance your UI
   could appear to hang as it waits for the background sync thread to finish a write
   transaction. Therefore, it's a best practice :ref:`not to write on the main thread
   when using Device Sync <ios-threading-three-rules>`.

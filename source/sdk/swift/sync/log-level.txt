You can set or change your app's log level to develop or debug your 
application. You might want to change the log level to log different 
amounts of data depending on the app's environment.

Realm Swift SDK v 10.39.0 and Later
-----------------------------------

Initialize an instance of a :swift-sdk:`Logger <Typealiases.html#/s:10RealmSwift6Loggera>` 
and define the function to use for logging. The 
:objc-sdk:`RLMLogLevel <Enums/RLMLogLevel.html>` enum represents the different
levels of logging you can configure.

Set a Default Logger and Change Log Levels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can set a logger as the default logger for your app with ``Logger.shared``. 
After you set the default logger, you can change the log level during the app 
lifecycle as needed.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Sync.snippet.set-default-logger.swift
   :language: swift

.. tip:: Default log levels

   The default log level is ``.info``. To disable all log messages, set the 
   logger to ``Logger.shared.level = .off``. You can adjust logging as needed
   throughout the app lifecycle.

Realm Swift SDK v 10.38.3 and Earlier
-------------------------------------

These APIs and their associated types are deprecated in version 10.39.0.

      :tabid: swift

      You can set the Device Sync client log level on the
      :swift-sdk:`SyncManager
      <Typealiases.html#/s:10RealmSwift11SyncManagera>` instance on your
      :swift-sdk:`App <Extensions/App.html>`.

         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      You can set the Device Sync client log level on the
      :objc-sdk:`RLMSyncManager <Classes/RLMSyncManager.html>` instance
      on your :objc-sdk:`RLMApp <Classes/RLMApp.html>`.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Sync.snippet.set-log-level.m
         :language: objectivec

.. tip::

   See :objc-sdk:`RLMSyncLogLevel <Enums/RLMSyncLogLevel.html>` for a
   description of each available log level. Note that more logging can
   negatively affect performance.

.. include:: /includes/tip-sync-log-levels.rst

Set a Custom Logger
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can pipe Device Sync logs to a custom logger by setting the ``logger`` 
property on the ``SyncManager``. You must set this property before you 
open any synced realms.

If you do not specify this property, the Realm Swift SDK outputs log strings
to Apple System Logger.

Overview
--------

The examples on this page describe how to work with synced realms in
Swift SDK versions prior to 10.15.0. Alternately, if you're building apps 
for iOS targets prior to 15.0, with Swift versions older than 5.5, or with 
Objective-C, you can use these methods and code examples to work with 
realms asynchronously.

.. note::
  
   The ``OpenBehavior`` enum, and :ref:`the ability to specify whether to download
   data before opening a realm<ios-specify-download-behavior>`, do not 
   apply to the legacy examples on this page. If you want to require 
   downloading changes before opening a realm with this older syntax, 
   you must use ``asyncOpen``, which :ref:`always downloads changes before 
   opening a realm<ios-open-synced-realm-after-sync>`.

.. seealso::

   If you're using Swift 5.5 with Swift SDK 10.15.0 or newer, see the 
   :ref:`Sync Changes Between Devices page <ios-sync-changes-between-devices>`.

Open A Synced Realm Offline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can work with synced realms offline if the user credentials are
cached and you use the ``Realm()`` initializers to open the realms.
If you use ``asyncOpen`` instead of initializers to open the realm, 
the user always has the most up-to-date data, but must have a network 
connection.

Open a Synced Realm for the First Time
--------------------------------------

Authenticate a User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first time a user opens a realm, you must authenticate the user. 
Upon this initial login, Realm caches login credentials. On 
subsequent opens, check for a logged-in user, and then open new realms. 
You can skip the login flow while you have a logged-in user. 

Depending on your business logic, you may also require the user to download 
data from App Services before opening a synced realm on device.

Log In and Open a Synced Realm with Data on the Device
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs-realm-languages::
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      The first time you log in and open a synced realm, you log the
      user in, and pass the  user's :swift-sdk:`Configuration <Structs/Realm/Configuration.html>` 
      object with the desired :ref:`partition value <partition-value>` to
      :swift-sdk:`Realm.asyncOpen(configuration:)
      <Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V9asyncOpen13configuration13callbackQueue0F0AC05AsyncD4TaskVAC13ConfigurationV_So17OS_dispatch_queueCyACSg_s5Error_pSgtctFZ>`:

      This opens a synced realm on the device with data that is present
      on the device. The realm attempts to sync with your App in
      the background to check for changes on the server, or upload changes 
      that the user has made.

         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      The first time you log in and open a synced realm, log the
      user in, and pass the user's :objc-sdk:`RLMSyncConfiguration 
      <Classes/RLMRealmConfiguration.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMRealmConfiguration(py)syncConfiguration>` 
      object with the desired :objc-sdk:`partitionValue 
      <Classes/RLMSyncConfiguration.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMSyncConfiguration(py)partitionValue>` 
      to :objc-sdk:`+[RLMRealm realmWithConfiguration:error:]
      <Classes/RLMRealm.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMRealm(cm)realmWithConfiguration:error:>`.

      This opens a synced realm on the device with data that is present
      on the device. The realm attempts to sync with your App in
      the background to check for changes on the server, or upload changes 
      that the user has made.

Log In and Download Changes Before Opening a Realm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs-realm-languages::
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      If you want to download data from your backend App before the user 
      can work with the synced realm, log the user in, and pass the 
      user's :swift-sdk:`Configuration <Structs/Realm/Configuration.html>` 
      object with the desired :ref:`partition value <partition-value>` to
      :swift-sdk:`Realm.asyncOpen(configuration:)
      <Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V9asyncOpen13configuration13callbackQueue0F0AC05AsyncD4TaskVAC13ConfigurationV_So17OS_dispatch_queueCyACSg_s5Error_pSgtctFZ>`:

      When this is the first time opening the realm on the device, ``asyncOpen`` 
      downloads the entire remote realm before opening the file on device. 
      If the synced realm is already present on the device, ``asyncOpen`` 
      downloads only the latest changes since the realm last synced with 
      the App.

         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      To open a synced realm asynchronously, pass the logged-in user's
      :objc-sdk:`RLMRealmConfiguration
      <Classes/RLMRealmConfiguration.html>` object with the desired
      :ref:`partition value <partition-value>` to :objc-sdk:`+[RLMRealm
      asyncOpenWithConfiguration:callbackQueue:callback]
      <Classes/RLMRealm.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMRealm(cm)asyncOpenWithConfiguration:callbackQueue:callback:>`:

      If this is the first time opening the realm on the device, ``asyncOpen`` 
      downloads the entire remote realm before opening the file on device. 
      If a realm is already present on the device, ``asyncOpen`` downloads 
      only the latest changes since the realm last synced with the App.
      
      A common pattern is to use ``asyncOpen`` during a login 
      flow, but use ``init`` to open a realm on subsequent opens.

Open a Synced Realm with Cached Credentials
-------------------------------------------

After you have authenticated a user and created a sync configuration to 
open a realm, you can open the same realm again using the sync 
configuration with cached credentials. You can use two different methods to 
open the synced realm, depending on your needs:

- :ref:`Open a synced realm with data that is on the device 
  <ios-open-synced-realm-with-data-on-device>` immediately. This works regardless 
  of network status, and enables the user to start working with the realm 
  without waiting for changes to download from the server. However, data that 
  is on the device may be stale. Additionally, this may result in behavior that 
  seems unexpected or surprising to the user. Data may appear "suddenly" as 
  it syncs in the background after the user has already begun working with the 
  realm. You must account for this in your UI logic.
- :ref:`Open a synced realm after syncing changes <ios-open-synced-realm-after-sync>`. 
  This requires the user to have a network connection, so you should 
  :ref:`check the network connection <ios-check-network-connection>` before 
  attempting to open the realm from the server. This method of opening the 
  realm ensures that the user always has the most up-to-date data from the 
  server. The cost of using this method is an upfront pause while loading, and 
  being unable to open the realm offline.

.. _ios-open-synced-realm-with-data-on-device:

Open a Synced Realm with Data on the Device
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use initializers to open the realm immediately, using the data
that is on the device. If you want to open a synced realm offline, use 
this method. You must have a cached, logged-in user.

.. example::

   Consider the example of a note-taking app. You might decide it's most 
   important for your user to be able to quickly jot down a note. The user 
   shouldn't have to wait while downloading changes that a family member made 
   to a shared note. In this case, opening a realm with ``init`` gets the 
   user to the UI right away, or while the user is offline. When the user has
   a network connection, changes sync in the background.

   In contrast, you might want a store inventory app to always check the server 
   for changes before working with a realm. If you use stale data from the
   last time the realm was open on the device, the app data could reflect 
   incorrect counts, inaccurate pricing data, or other out-of-date data issues. 
   In that case, you'd want the app to download changes before letting the user
   work with the data.

.. note::

   A synced realm is not interchangeable with a local Realm Database.
   If you want to sync a local Realm Database, you must :ref:`copy the
   content from the local realm to a synced realm <copy-local-data-to-synced-realm>`. 
   A local realm lives only on the device and never attempts to sync with 
   the server. A synced realm contains additional Sync-related 
   metadata, and consistently and persistently attempts to connect and sync 
   data with the server.

      To open a synced realm with data on the device, pass the 
      logged-in user's :swift-sdk:`Configuration <Structs/Realm/Configuration.html>` 
      object with the desired :ref:`partition value <partition-value>` to
      :swift-sdk:`Realm() <Structs/Realm.html>` initializers. This opens 
      the realm immediately, before downloading changesets from the server.
      This works if the device is offline, but may lead to temporary data
      inconsistencies while your app downloads any new remote data. The 
      realm updates from the server in the background.

      You can open the realm synchronously with the
      :objc-sdk:`+[RLMRealm realmWithConfiguration:error:]
      <Classes/RLMRealm.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMRealm(cm)realmWithConfiguration:error:>`
      initializers. This opens the realm immediately, before downloading 
      changesets from the server. This works if the device is offline, but 
      may lead to temporary data inconsistencies while your app downloads 
      any new remote data. The realm updates from the server in the 
      background.

.. _ios-open-synced-realm-after-sync:

Open a Synced Realm After Downloading Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
In some apps, such as games, you might want the user to always have current data. 
Use ``asyncOpen`` to sync the realm with the App before opening it.

.. example::

   Say a user plays a game on both an iPad and an iPhone. The user progresses 
   three levels on the iPad. Later, the user opens the game on an iPhone. In this 
   case, ``asyncOpen`` is a better way to open the realm. Loading with stale 
   data would get the user into the game faster, but the user's data would be 
   three levels out of sync.

   In contrast, if you had an app that allowed the user to record and save their
   favorite recipes, you might want to give them the option to create a new 
   recipe without waiting to download updates, or even if they're offline. If 
   you opened a synced realm with data on the device, the user could enter a 
   new recipe, which would sync with the App when they next had a network 
   connection.

A common pattern is to open a realm with ``asyncOpen`` in the login flow, 
and then use ``init`` for subsequent opens. If you want users to only interact 
with the most up-to-date version of your data, you can exclusively use 
``asyncOpen``. This incurs the cost of additional loading time and prevents 
users from opening a realm while offline.

.. tabs-realm-languages::
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      To open a synced realm only after it has downloaded changes from your 
      App, verify that the user has :ref:`a network connection <ios-check-network-connection>`, 
      and then pass the logged-in user's :swift-sdk:`Configuration <Structs/Realm/Configuration.html>` 
      object with the desired :ref:`partition value <partition-value>` to
      :swift-sdk:`Realm.asyncOpen(configuration:)
      <Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V9asyncOpen13configuration13callbackQueue0F0AC05AsyncD4TaskVAC13ConfigurationV_So17OS_dispatch_queueCyACSg_s5Error_pSgtctFZ>`:

      If this is the first time opening the realm on the device, ``asyncOpen`` 
      downloads the entire remote realm before opening the file on device. 
      If a realm is already present on the device, ``asyncOpen`` downloads 
      only the latest changes since the realm last synced with the App.
      
      You might use ``asyncOpen`` exclusively to open realms when you need
      to ensure that the user always has the latest data from the server.
      However, if the user is currently offline, the user won't be able to
      work with the realm.

Check the Network Connection
----------------------------

.. tip:: 

   {+service+}'s *offline-first* design means that you generally don't
   need to check the current network connection state. That said, the
   ``connectionState`` property is available if your app calls for some
   indication of connection state.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      To check the connection state, you can read the synced {+realm+}'s
      SyncSession instance's :swift-sdk:`connectionState
      <Extensions/SyncSession.html#/s:So14RLMSyncSessionC10RealmSwiftE15ConnectionStatea>`
      property directly. 

      This property is :apple:`KVO-compliant
      <library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueObserving/KeyValueObserving.html>`,
      so you can observe changes using KVO or even Combine.

         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      To check the connection state, you can read the synced {+realm+}'s
      RLMSyncSession instance's :objc-sdk:`connectionState
      <Classes/RLMSyncSession.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMSyncSession(py)connectionState>`
      property directly.

      This property is :apple:`KVO-compliant
      <library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueObserving/KeyValueObserving.html>`,
      so you can observe changes using KVO. The following example
      demonstrates how to implement an observer class:

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Sync.snippet.check-network-connection-setup.m
         :language: objectivec

      You can then attach an observer instance to the RLMSyncSession
      object. Be sure to remove the observer when finished.

         :language: objectivec

Overview
--------

You query data stored in MongoDB directly from your client application code 
by using the Realm Swift SDK's :swift-sdk:`MongoClient
<Typealiases.html#/s:10RealmSwift11MongoClienta>` with the :manual:`Query API
</tutorial/query-documents>`. 
Atlas App Services provides data access :ref:`rules <mongodb-rules>` on 
collections to securely retrieve results based on the logged-in user or the 
content of each document.

.. seealso::

   This page covers querying a MongoDB data source directly. To filter data
   you retrieve from Realm Database, see: :ref:`Filter Data 
   <ios-client-query-engine>`. 

Use Cases
---------

There are a variety of reasons you might want to query a MongoDB data source. 
Working with data in your client via Atlas Device Sync is not always practical or 
possible. You might want to query MongoDB when:

- The data set is large or the client device has constraints against loading 
  the entire data set
- You are :ref:`creating or updating custom user data <ios-custom-user-data>`
- You are retrieving documents that are not modeled in Realm
- Your app needs to access collections that don't have strict schemas
- A non-Realm service generates collections that you want to access

While not exhaustive, these are some common use cases for querying MongoDB 
directly.

.. _ios-mongodb-set-up:

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you can remotely access MongoDB, you must:

- :ref:`link-a-data-source` 

.. _ios-mongodb-example-dataset:

Example Data
------------

These examples operate on a MongoDB collection that describes coffee drinks in 
a chain of coffee shops. The documents represent objects with these properties:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/MongoDBRemoteAccess.snippet.coffee-drink-model.swift
   :language: swift

The complete code for each example includes logging in and instantiating a 
MongoDB collection handle before completing each operation. For brevity, these 
examples omit the login and collection handle code. However, each complete 
example looks like this:

.. include:: /examples/generated/code/start/MongoDBRemoteAccess.snippet.insert-sample-data.swift.rst

.. _ios-mongodb-async-await-query:

Async/Await Query MongoDB
-------------------------

.. versionadded:: 10.16.0

The Realm Swift SDK provides :swift-sdk:`async/await versions of the 
MongoCollection methods<Extensions/MongoCollection.html>`.

All of the methods on this page are compatible with the async/await syntax.
This example illustrates that syntax for the ``collection.insertOne()`` method. 
You can see the completion handler version in :ref:`Insert a Single Document 
<ios-mongodb-insertOne>`.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/MongoDBRemoteAccess.snippet.async-await-insert.swift
   :language: swift

.. include:: /includes/swift-async-await-support.rst

.. _ios-mongodb-create-documents:

Create Documents
----------------

These code snippets demonstrate how to insert one or more documents into a 
MongoDB collection from a mobile application. These methods take one or more 
:swift-sdk:`documents <Typealiases.html#/s:10RealmSwift8Documenta>` and return
a result. Success returns the :swift-sdk:`objectId <Classes/ObjectId.html>` of
the inserted document, or an array of objectIds in order when inserting 
multiple documents.

.. _ios-mongodb-insertOne:

Insert a Single Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can insert a single document using :swift-sdk:`collection.insertOne() <Extensions/MongoCollection.html#/s:So18RLMMongoCollectionC10RealmSwiftE9insertOneyySDySSAC7AnyBSONOSgG_ys6ResultOyAFs5Error_pGctF>`.

This snippet inserts a single document describing a "Bean of the Day" coffee 
drink into a :ref:`collection of documents that describe coffee drinks for sale 
in a group of stores <ios-mongodb-example-dataset>`:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/MongoDBRemoteAccess.snippet.insert-one.swift
   :language: swift

Running this snippet produces this output:

.. code-block:: text

   Successfully inserted a document with id: objectId(6108...)

.. _ios-mongodb-insertMany:

Insert Multiple Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can insert multiple documents using :swift-sdk:`collection.insertMany() <Extensions/MongoCollection.html#/s:So18RLMMongoCollectionC10RealmSwiftE10insertManyyySaySDySSAC7AnyBSONOSgGG_ys6ResultOySayAFGs5Error_pGctF>`.

This snippet inserts three documents describing coffee drinks into a 
:ref:`collection of documents that describe coffee drinks for sale in a group 
of stores <ios-mongodb-example-dataset>`:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/MongoDBRemoteAccess.snippet.insert-many.swift
   :language: swift

Running this snippet produces this output:

.. code-block:: text

   Successfully inserted 3 new documents.

.. _ios-mongodb-read-documents:

Read Documents
--------------

These code snippets demonstrate how to read data stored in a MongoDB collection
from a mobile application. Read operations use a standard :manual:`query syntax
</core/document/#document-query-filter>` to specify which documents to return 
from the database. Read operations return a result that that resolves to
either a single matched document (in the case of ``findOneDocument()``), a 
``long`` numeric value (in the case of ``count()``) or an array of matched 
documents (in the case of ``find()``).

.. _ios-mongodb-findOne:

Find a Single Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can find a single document using :swift-sdk:`collection.findOneDocument() <Extensions/MongoCollection.html#/s:So18RLMMongoCollectionC10RealmSwiftE15findOneDocument6filter7options7Combine6FutureCySDySSAC7AnyBSONOSgGSgs5Error_pGAM_So14RLMFindOptionsCtF>`.

This snippet finds a single document from a :ref:`collection of documents 
that describe coffee drinks for sale in a group of stores 
<ios-mongodb-example-dataset>`, where the document's ``name`` field contains
the string value "Maple Latte":

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/MongoDBRemoteAccess.snippet.find-one.swift
   :language: swift

Running this snippet produces this output:

.. code-block:: text

   Found a matching document: Optional([
      "name": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("Maple Latte")), 
      "_id": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.objectId(60f5...)), 
      "creamer": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("true")), 
      "partition": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("Store 42")), 
      "beanRegion": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("Yirgacheffe, Ethiopia"))])

.. _ios-mongodb-findMany:

Find Multiple Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can find multiple documents using :swift-sdk:`collection.find() <Extensions/MongoCollection.html#/s:So18RLMMongoCollectionC10RealmSwiftE4find6filter7Combine6FutureCySaySDySSAC7AnyBSONOSgGGs5Error_pGAL_tF>`.

This snippet finds all documents in a :ref:`collection of documents that 
describe coffee drinks for sale in a group of stores <ios-mongodb-example-dataset>`, 
where the document's ``name`` field contains the value "Americano":

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/MongoDBRemoteAccess.snippet.find-many.swift
   :language: swift

Running this snippet produces this output:

.. code-block:: text

   Results: 
   Coffee drink: [
      "partition": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("Store 42")), 
      "creamer": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("false")), 
      "beanRegion": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("Timbio, Colombia")), 
      "_id": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.objectId(6102...)), 
      "name": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("Americano"))]
   Coffee drink: [
      "creamer": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("false")), 
      "name": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("Americano")), 
      "partition": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("Store 47")), 
      "_id": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.objectId(6102...)), 
      "beanRegion": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("San Marcos, Guatemala"))]

.. _ios-mongodb-count:

Count Documents in the Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can count documents in a collection using :swift-sdk:`collection.count() <Extensions/MongoCollection.html#/s:So18RLMMongoCollectionC10RealmSwiftE5count6filter7Combine6FutureCySis5Error_pGSDySSAC7AnyBSONOSgG_tF>`.
You can specify an optional query and limit to determine which
documents to count. If you don't specify a query, the action counts all 
documents in the collection.

This snippet counts the number of documents in a :ref:`collection of documents 
that describe coffee drinks for sale in a group of stores 
<ios-mongodb-example-dataset>`, where the document's ``name`` field contains 
the value "Bean of the Day":

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/MongoDBRemoteAccess.snippet.count.swift
   :language: swift

Running this snippet produces this output:

.. code-block:: text

   Found this many documents in the collection matching the filter: 24

.. _ios-mongodb-update-documents:

Update Documents
----------------

These code snippets demonstrate how to update data stored in a MongoDB 
collection from a mobile application. Update operations use queries to 
specify which documents to update, and :manual:`update operators
</reference/operator/update>` to desribe how to mutate documents that match 
the query. Update operations return a result that resolves to an 
:swift-sdk:`UpdateResult <Typealiases.html#/s:10RealmSwift12UpdateResulta>` 
or ``Error``.

.. _ios-mongodb-updateOne:

Update a Single Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can update a single document using :swift-sdk:`collection.updateOneDocument() 
<Extensions/MongoCollection.html#/s:So18RLMMongoCollectionC10RealmSwiftE17updateOneDocument6filter0E07Combine6FutureCySo15RLMUpdateResultCs5Error_pGSDySSAC7AnyBSONOSgG_AQtF>`.

This snippet updates a single document in a :ref:`collection of documents 
that describe coffee drinks for sale in a group of stores 
<ios-mongodb-example-dataset>`. This update operation queries for a document
whose ``name`` field contains the value "Bean of the Day", and sets the
``containsDairy`` field to "true":

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/MongoDBRemoteAccess.snippet.update-one.swift
   :language: swift

Running this snippet produces this output:

.. code-block:: text

   Successfully updated a matching document.

.. _ios-mongodb-updateMany:

Update Multiple Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can update multiple documents using :swift-sdk:`collection.updateManyDocuments() <Extensions/MongoCollection.html#/s:So18RLMMongoCollectionC10RealmSwiftE19updateManyDocuments6filter0E07Combine6FutureCySo15RLMUpdateResultCs5Error_pGSDySSAC7AnyBSONOSgG_AQtF>`.

This snippet updates multiple documents in a :ref:`collection of documents 
that describe coffee drinks for sale in a group of stores 
<ios-mongodb-example-dataset>`. This update operation queries for documents
where the ``name`` field contains the value "Bean of the Day", and changes the
``containsDairy`` field to "true":

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/MongoDBRemoteAccess.snippet.update-many.swift
   :language: swift

Running this snippet produces this output:

.. code-block:: text

   Successfully updated 24 documents.

.. _ios-mongodb-upsert:

Upsert Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If an update operation does not match any document in the collection,
you can automatically insert a single new document into the collection
that matches the update query by setting the ``upsert`` option to
``true``.

The following snippet updates a document in a :ref:`collection of documents 
that describe coffee drinks for sale in a group of stores 
<ios-mongodb-example-dataset>`. If no document matches the query, it 
inserts a new document if no document. This operation queries for documents 
where the ``name`` field has a value of "Bean of the Day", and 
the ``partition`` field has a value of "Store 55". 

Because this snippet sets the ``upsert`` option to ``true``, if no
document matches the query, MongoDB creates a new document that includes
both the query and specified updates:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/MongoDBRemoteAccess.snippet.upsert.swift
   :language: swift

Running this snippet produces this output:

.. code-block:: text

   Successfully upserted a document with id: Optional(6108...)

.. _ios-mongodb-delete-documents:

Delete Documents
----------------

These code snippets demonstrate how to delete documents that
are stored in a MongoDB collection from a mobile application.
Delete operations use a query to specify which documents to delete
and return results that resolve to an ``Int`` count of deleted documents 
or ``Error``.

.. _ios-mongodb-deleteOne:

Delete a Single Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can delete a single document from a collection using :swift-sdk:`collection.deleteOneDocument() <Extensions/MongoCollection.html#/s:So18RLMMongoCollectionC10RealmSwiftE17deleteOneDocument6filter7Combine6FutureCySis5Error_pGSDySSAC7AnyBSONOSgG_tF>`.

This snippet deletes one document in a :ref:`collection of documents 
that describe coffee drinks for sale in a group of stores 
<ios-mongodb-example-dataset>`. This operation queries for a document where
the ``name`` field has a value of "Mocha" and the ``partition`` field has
a value of "Store 17", and deletes it.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/MongoDBRemoteAccess.snippet.delete-one.swift
   :language: swift

Running this snippet produces this output:

.. code-block:: text

   Successfully deleted a document.

.. _ios-mongodb-deleteMany:

Delete Multiple Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can delete multiple items from a collection using :swift-sdk:`collection.deleteManyDocuments() <Extensions/MongoCollection.html#/s:So18RLMMongoCollectionC10RealmSwiftE19deleteManyDocuments6filter7Combine6FutureCySis5Error_pGSDySSAC7AnyBSONOSgG_tF>`.

This snippet deletes all documents in a :ref:`collection of documents 
that describe coffee drinks for sale in a group of stores 
<ios-mongodb-example-dataset>` that match the query for documents
whose ``name`` field contains the value "Caramel Latte":

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/MongoDBRemoteAccess.snippet.delete-many.swift
   :language: swift

Running this snippet produces this output:

.. code-block:: text

   Successfully deleted 3 documents.

.. _ios-mongodb-aggregation-pipelines:

Aggregate Documents
-------------------

Aggregation operations run all documents in a collection through a
series of data aggregation stages called an :manual:`aggregation
pipeline </core/aggregation-pipeline>`. Aggregation allows you to filter
and transform documents, collect summary data about groups of related
documents, and other complex data operations.

You can configure and run aggregation operations on a collection using 
:swift-sdk:`collection.aggregate() <Extensions/MongoCollection.html#/s:So18RLMMongoCollectionC10RealmSwiftE9aggregate8pipeline7Combine6FutureCySaySDySSAC7AnyBSONOSgGGs5Error_pGAM_tF>`.

An aggregation operation accepts a list of aggregation stages as input
and returns a result that resolves to a collection of documents processed
by the pipeline, or an ``Error``.

.. _ios-mongodb-aggregate-filter:

Filter Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the :manual:`$match
</reference/operator/aggregation/match/>` stage to filter
documents using standard MongoDB :manual:`query syntax
</tutorial/query-documents>`:

This ``$match`` stage filters documents to include only those where the 
``partition`` field has a value equal to "Store 42":

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/MongoDBRemoteAccessAggregate.snippet.aggregation-match.swift
   :language: swift

Running this snippet produces this output:

.. code-block:: text

   Successfully ran the aggregation: 
   Coffee drink: [
      "partition": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("Store 42")), 
      "creamer": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("false")), 
      "beanRegion": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("Timbio, Colombia")), 
      "_id": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.objectId(6102...)), 
      "name": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("Americano"))]
   Coffee drink: [
      "creamer": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("false")), 
      "name": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("Americano")), 
      "partition": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("Store 42")), 
      "_id": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.objectId(6102...)), 
      "beanRegion": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("San Marcos, Guatemala"))]
   (...more results...)

.. _ios-mongodb-aggregate-group:

Group Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the :manual:`$group
</reference/operator/aggregation/group/>` stage to aggregate summary
data for one or more documents. MongoDB groups documents based
on the expression defined in the ``_id`` field of the ``$group`` stage.
You can reference a specific document field by prefixing the field name
with a ``$``.

This ``$group`` stage arranges documents by the value of their
``partition`` field, which in this case is the store number. It then 
calculates the number of coffee drink documents that contain that store number
as the value of the ``partition`` field. In other words, we're calculating
the number of coffee drinks for each store number. 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/MongoDBRemoteAccessAggregate.snippet.aggregation-group.swift
   :language: swift

Running this snippet produces this output:

.. code-block:: text

   Successfully ran the aggregation.
   ["numItems": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.int64(6)), "_id": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("Store 43"))]
   ["numItems": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.int64(16)), "_id": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("Store 42"))]
   ["_id": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("Store 47")), "numItems": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.int64(7))]
   (...more results...)

.. _ios-mongodb-aggregate-project:

Project Document Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the :manual:`$project
</reference/operator/aggregation/project/>` stage to include or omit
specific fields from documents or to calculate new fields using
:manual:`aggregation operators </reference/operator/aggregation>`.
Projections work in two ways:

- Specify that you want to include fields by using a ``1``. This has the 
  side-effect of implicitly excluding all unspecified fields.

- Specify that you want to exclude fields by using a ``0``. This has the 
  side-effect of implicitly including all unspecified fields.

These two methods of projection are mutually exclusive. If you
specify fields to include, you cannot also specify fields to exclude, and
vice versa.

.. note::

   The ``_id`` field is a special case: it is always included in every
   query unless explicitly specified otherwise. For this reason, you
   *can* exclude the ``_id`` field with a ``0`` value while simultaneously
   including other fields, like ``_partition``, with a ``1``. Only the
   special case of exclusion of the ``_id`` field allows both exclusion
   and inclusion in one ``$project`` stage.

The following ``$project`` stage omits the ``_id`` field, includes
the ``name`` field, and creates a new field named ``storeNumber``.
The ``storeNumber`` is generated using two aggregation operators:

1. ``$split`` separates the ``partition`` value into two string
   segments surrounding the space character. For example, the value
   "Store 42" split in this way returns an array with two elements:
   "Store" and "42".

2. ``$arrayElemAt`` selects a specific element from an array based
   on the second argument. In this case, the value ``1`` selects the
   second element from the array generated by the ``$split`` operator
   since arrays index from ``0``. For example, the value ["Store", "42"]
   passed to this operation would return a value of "42".

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/MongoDBRemoteAccessAggregate.snippet.aggregation-project.swift
   :language: swift

Running this snippet produces this output:

.. code-block:: text

   Successfully ran the aggregation.
   ["name": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("Maple Latte")), "storeNumber": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("42"))]
   ["storeNumber": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("42")), "name": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("Americano"))]
   ["name": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("Americano")), "storeNumber": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("47"))]
   (...more results...)

.. _ios-mongodb-aggregate-add-fields:

Add Fields to Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the :manual:`$addFields
</reference/operator/aggregation/addFields/>` stage to add new fields
with calculated values using :manual:`aggregation operators
</reference/operator/aggregation>`.

.. note::

   ``$addFields`` is similar to :manual:`$project
   </reference/operator/aggregation/project/>` but does not allow you to
   include or omit fields.

The following ``$addFields`` stage creates a new field named
``storeNumber`` where the value is the output of two aggregate operators
that transform the value of the ``partition`` field.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/MongoDBRemoteAccessAggregate.snippet.aggregation-add-fields.swift
   :language: swift

Running this snippet produces this output:

.. code-block:: text

   Successfully ran the aggregation.
   ["storeNumber": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("42")), "creamer": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("true")), "_id": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.objectId(60f5f39f1eb0f39071acef87)), "name": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("Maple Latte")), "beanRegion": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("Yirgacheffe, Ethiopia")), "partition": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("Store 42"))]
   ["beanRegion": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("Yirgacheffe, Ethiopia")), "storeNumber": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("42")), "_id": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.objectId(6102b91aaa4f3fc37642119e)), "name": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("Maple Latte")), "creamer": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("true")), "partition": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("Store 42"))]
   ["creamer": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("false")), "_id": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.objectId(6102f577099eb9b818497908)), "beanRegion": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("Timbio, Colombia")), "storeNumber": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("42")), "partition": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("Store 42")), "name": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("Americano"))]
   (...more results...)

.. _ios-mongodb-aggregate-unwind:

Unwind Array Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the :manual:`$unwind
</reference/operator/aggregation/unwind/>` stage to transform a single
document containing an array into multiple documents containing individual
values from that array. When you unwind an array field,
MongoDB copies each document once for each element of the array field
but replaces the array value with the array element in each copy.

The following ``$unwind`` stage creates a new document for each
element of the ``items`` array in each document. It also adds a field
called ``itemIndex`` to each new document that specifies the
element's position index in the original array:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/MongoDBRemoteAccessAggregate.snippet.aggregation-unwind.swift
   :language: swift

Consider this document that includes a ``featuredInPromotions`` array:

.. code-block:: text

   _id: 610802b44386a9ed3144447d,
   name: "Maple Latte",
   containsDairy:"true",
   partition:"Store 42",
   beanRegion: "Yirgacheffe, Ethiopia",
   featuredInPromotions: [
      "Spring into Spring",
      "Tastes of Fall",
      "Winter Delights"
   ]

If we apply the example ``$unwind`` stage to this document, the stage outputs
the following three documents:

.. code-block:: text

   Successfully ran the aggregation.
   Coffee drink: [
      "featuredInPromotions": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("Spring into Spring")), 
      "itemIndex": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.int64(0)),
      "name": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("Maple Latte")), 
      "beanRegion": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("Yirgacheffe, Ethiopia")), 
      "containsDairy": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("true")),  
      "partition": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("Store 42")), 
      "_id": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.objectId(6108...))]
   Coffee drink: [
      "featuredInPromotions": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("Tastes of Fall")),
      "itemIndex": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.int64(1)),
      "name": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("Maple Latte")), 
      "containsDairy": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("true")), 
      "beanRegion": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("Yirgacheffe, Ethiopia")), 
      "partition": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("Store 42")), 
      "_id": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.objectId(6108...))]
   Coffee drink: [
      "featuredInPromotions": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("Winter Delights")),
      "itemIndex": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.int64(2)), 
      "partition": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("Store 42")), 
      "containsDairy": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("true")), 
      "beanRegion": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("Yirgacheffe, Ethiopia")),  
      "_id": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.objectId(6108...)), 
      "name": Optional(RealmSwift.AnyBSON.string("Maple Latte"))]

You could then ``$group`` by the value of ``featuredInPromotions`` and ``$sum`` 
the number of coffee drinks in each promotion as in the :ref:`group documents 
example <ios-mongodb-aggregate-group>`, or perform other calculations or 
transformations based on your data.

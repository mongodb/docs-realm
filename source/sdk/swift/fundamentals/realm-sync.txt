Overview
--------

:ref:`Realm Sync <sync-overview>` automatically synchronizes data between 
client applications and your backend. When a client device is online, 
{+sync-short+} asynchronously synchronizes data in a background thread 
between the device and your backend {+app+}. 

When you use Sync in your client application, your implementation must match 
the :ref:`Sync Mode <sync-modes>` you select in your backend {+app+} 
configuration.

.. _ios-partition-based-sync-fundamentals:

Partition-Based Sync
--------------------

When you select :ref:`Partition-Based Sync <partition-based-sync>` for your 
backend {+app+} configuration, your client implementation must include a 
partition value. This is the value of the :ref:`partition key 
<partition-key>` field you select when you configure Partition-Based Sync. 

The partition value determines which data the client application can access.

You pass in the partition value when you open a synced realm [ADD LINK].

.. _ios-flexible-sync-fundamentals:

Flexible Sync
-------------

When you select :ref:`Flexible Sync <flexible-sync>` for your backend {+app+} 
configuration, your client implementation must include subscriptions to 
queries on :ref:`queryable fields <queryable-fields>`. Flexible Sync works 
by synchronizing data that matches query subscriptions you maintain in the 
client application. 

A subscription contains a set of queries. Realm Flexible Sync returns 
documents matching those queries, where the user has the appropriate 
:ref:`permissions <flexible-sync-rules-and-permissions>` to read and/or 
read and write the documents. If there are documents that match the query, 
but the client does not have the permission to read or write them, they 
do not sync to the client application.

You can form queries using Realm Query Language [ADD LINK].

.. important::

   Flexible Sync does not support all the operators available in Realm 
   Query Language. See Realm Query Language: Flexible Sync Supported 
   Operators [ADD LINK] for details.

Subscription sets are based on a specific type of :ref:`realm object 
<ios-realm-objects>`. You might have multiple subscription sets if you 
have many types of realm objects.

To use Flexible Sync in your client application, open a synced realm 
with a flexible sync configuration [ADD LINK]. Then, manage subscriptions
to determine which documents to sync [ADD LINK].

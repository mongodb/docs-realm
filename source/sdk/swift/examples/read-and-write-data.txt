Find a Specific Object by Primary Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs-realm-languages::
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift
      
      If you know the :ref:`primary key <ios-specify-a-primary-key>` for a given
      object, you can look it up directly with
      :swift-sdk:`Realm.object(ofType:forPrimaryKey:)

      If you know the :ref:`primary key <ios-specify-a-primary-key>` for
      a given object, you can look it up directly with
      :objc-sdk:`+[RLMObject objectForPrimaryKey:]

Query All Objects of a Given Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs-realm-languages::
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      To query for objects of a given type in a realm, pass the metatype
      instance ``YourClassName.self`` to :swift-sdk:`Realm.objects(_:)
      <Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V7objectsyAA7ResultsVyxGxmSo0aB6ObjectCRbzlF>`.
      This returns a :swift-sdk:`Results <Structs/Results.html>` object
      representing all objects of the given type in the realm.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadWriteData.snippet.objects.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      To query for objects of a given type in a realm, pass the realm
      instance to :objc-sdk:`+[YourRealmObjectClass allObjectsInRealm:]
      <Classes/RLMObject.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMObject(cm)allObjectsInRealm:>`.
      Replace ``YourRealmObjectClass`` with your Realm object class
      name. This returns an :objc-sdk:`RLMResults
      <Classes/RLMResults.html>` object representing all objects of the
      given type in the realm.

.. _ios-filter-queries-based-on-object-properties:

Filter Queries Based on Object Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A filter selects a subset of results based on the value(s) of one or
more object properties. {+client-database+} provides a full-featured 
:ref:`query engine <ios-client-query-engine>` that you can use to define filters.

.. tabs::
   
   .. tab:: Realm Swift Query API
      :tabid: swift

      .. versionadded:: 10.19.0

      To use the :ref:`{+client-db-short+} Swift Query API <ios-realm-swift-query-api>`, 
      call :swift-sdk:`.where <Structs/Query.html>` with a closure that 
      contains a query expression as an argument.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadWriteData.snippet.where.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab:: Swift NSPredicate
      :tabid: swift-nspredicate

      To filter, call :swift-sdk:`Results.filter(_:)
      <Structs/Results.html#/s:10RealmSwift7ResultsV6filteryACyxGSo11NSPredicateCF>`
      with a query predicate.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadWriteData.snippet.filter.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab:: Objective C
      :tabid: objective-c

      To filter, call :objc-sdk:`-[RLMResults objectsWhere:]
      <Classes/RLMResults.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMResults(im)objectsWhere:>`
      with a query predicate.
      
      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadWriteData.snippet.filter.m
         :language: objectivec


.. tip:: Filter on Related and Embedded Object Properties

   To filter a query based on a property of an :ref:`embedded object
   <ios-define-an-embedded-object-property>` or a :ref:`related object
   <ios-declare-relationship-properties>`, use dot-notation as if it were
   in a regular, nested object.

.. seealso::
   
   :ref:`ios-filter-data`

.. _ios-filter-object-id:

Filter on Object ID Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The types in your predicate must match the types of the
properties. Avoid comparing
:swift-sdk:`ObjectId <Classes/ObjectId.html>` properties to strings, as
{+client-database+} does not automatically convert strings to ObjectIds.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Realm Swift Query API
      :tabid: swift

      .. versionadded:: 10.19.0

      The Realm Swift Query API's built-in type safety simplifies writing a
      query with an ObjectId:

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadWriteData.snippet.object-id-model.swift
         :language: swift

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadWriteData.snippet.tsq-object-id.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab:: Swift NSPredicate
      :tabid: swift-nspredicate

      The following example shows the correct and incorrect way to write a
      query with an ObjectId given the following {+client-db-short+} object:

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadWriteData.snippet.object-id-model.swift
         :language: swift

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadWriteData.snippet.query-object-id.swift
         :language: swift

.. _ios-sort-query-results:

Sort Query Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A sort operation allows you to configure the order in which Realm
Database returns queried objects. You can sort based on one or more
properties of the objects in the results collection. Realm Database only
guarantees a consistent order of results if you explicitly sort them.

.. tabs-realm-languages::
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      To sort, call :swift-sdk:`Results.sorted(byKeyPath:ascending:)
      <Structs/Results.html#/s:10RealmSwift7ResultsV6sorted9byKeyPath9ascendingACyxGSS_SbtF>`
      with the desired key path to sort by.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadWriteData.snippet.sort.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      To sort, call :objc-sdk:`-[RLMResults
      sortedResultsUsingKeyPath:ascending:]
      <Classes/RLMResults.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMResults(im)sortedResultsUsingKeyPath:ascending:>`
      with the desired key path to sort by.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadWriteData.snippet.sort.m
         :language: objectivec

.. tip:: Sort on Related and Embedded Object Properties

   To sort a query based on a property of an :ref:`embedded object
   <ios-define-an-embedded-object-property>` or a :ref:`related object
   <ios-declare-relationship-properties>`, use dot-notation as if it
   were in a regular, nested object.

.. _ios-query-a-relationship:

Query a Relationship
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can query through a relationship the same way you would access a
member of a regular Swift or Objective-C object.

.. _ios-query-an-inverse-relationship:

Query an Inverse Relationship
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can query through an inverse relationship the same way you would
access a member of a regular Swift or Objective-C object.

.. tabs-realm-languages::
   
   .. tab::

.. _ios-aggregate-data:

Aggregate Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use Realm's aggregation operators for sophisticated queries
against list properties.

.. _ios-chain-queries:

Chain Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because :ref:`results are lazily evaluated <ios-results-are-lazy>`, you
can chain several queries together. Unlike traditional databases, this
does not require a separate trip to the database for each successive
query.

.. example::

   To get a result set for tan dogs, and tan dogs whose names start with
   'B', chain two queries like this:

.. _ios-write-operations:

Write Operations
----------------

.. _ios-create-a-new-object:

Create a New Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs-realm-languages::
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      To add an object to a realm, instantiate it as you would any other
      object and then pass it to :swift-sdk:`Realm.add(_:update:)
      <Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V3add_6updateySo0aB6ObjectC_AC12UpdatePolicyOtF>`
      inside of a write transaction.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadWriteData.snippet.create.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      To add an object to a realm, instantiate it as you would any other
      object and then pass it to :objc-sdk:`-[RLMRealm addObject:]
      <Classes/RLMRealm.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMRealm(im)addObject:>` inside
      of a write transaction.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadWriteData.snippet.create.m
         :language: objectivec

.. _ios-initialize-an-object-with-a-value:

Initialize Objects with a Value
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can initialize an object by passing an initializer value to
:swift-sdk:`Object.init(value:)
<Extensions/Object.html#/s:So16RealmSwiftObjectC0aB0E5valueAByp_tcfc>`.
The initializer value can be a :apple:`key-value coding
<library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueCoding/>`
compliant object, a dictionary, or an array containing one element for
each managed property.

.. note::

   When using an array as an initializer value, you must include all
   properties in the same order as they are defined in the model.

You can even initialize :ref:`related <ios-client-relationships>` or
:ref:`embedded objects <ios-embedded-objects>` by nesting initializer
values:

.. tabs-realm-languages::
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadWriteData.snippet.nested-objects.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadWriteData.snippet.nested-objects.m
         :language: objectivec


.. _ios-create-an-object-with-json:

Create an Object with JSON
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Realm does not directly support JSON, but you can use
:apple:`JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with:options:)
<documentation/foundation/jsonserialization/1415493-jsonobject>` to
convert JSON into a value that you can pass to
:swift-sdk:`Realm.create(_:value:update:)
<Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V6create_5value6updatexxm_ypAC12UpdatePolicyOtSo0aB6ObjectCRbzlF>`.

.. tabs-realm-languages::
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadWriteData.snippet.json.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadWriteData.snippet.json.m
         :language: objectivec

Nested objects or arrays in the JSON map to :ref:`to-one
<ios-to-one-relationship>` or :ref:`to-many relationships
<ios-to-one-relationship>`. 

The JSON property names and types must match the destination
:ref:`object schema <ios-object-schemas>` exactly. For example:

- ``float`` properties must be initialized with float-backed ``NSNumbers``.
- ``Date`` and ``Data`` properties cannot be inferred from strings. Convert them to the appropriate type before passing to :swift-sdk:`Realm.create(_:value:update:) <Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V6create_5value6updatexxm_ypAC12UpdatePolicyOtSo0aB6ObjectCRbzlF>`.
- Required properties cannot be ``null`` or missing in the JSON.

{+service-short+} ignores any properties in the JSON not defined in the
object schema.

.. tip::

   If your JSON schema doesn't exactly align with your Realm objects,
   consider using a third-party framework to transform your JSON. There
   are many model mapping frameworks that work with {+service-short+}.
   See a :github:`partial list in the realm-swift repository
   <realm/realm-swift/issues/694#issuecomment-144785299>`.

.. _ios-copy-an-object-to-another-realm:

Copy an Object to Another Realm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs-realm-languages::
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      To copy an object from one {+realm+} to another, pass the original
      object to :swift-sdk:`Realm.create(_:value:update:):
      <Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V6create_5value6updatexxm_ypAC12UpdatePolicyOtSo0aB6ObjectCRbzlF>`:

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadWriteData.snippet.copy-to-another-realm.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      To copy an object from one {+realm+} to another, pass the original
      object to :objc-sdk:`+[RLMObject createInRealm:withValue:]
      <Classes/RLMObject.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMObject(cm)createInRealm:withValue:>`:

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadWriteData.snippet.copy-to-another-realm.m
         :language: objectivec


.. important::

   The ``create`` methods do not support handling cyclical object
   graphs. Do not pass in an object containing relationships involving
   objects that refer back to their parents, either directly or
   indirectly.

.. _ios-async-write:

Perform a Background Write
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 10.26.0

You can add, modify, or delete objects in the background using 
:swift-sdk:`writeAsync <Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V10writeAsync_10onCompletes6UInt32Vyyc_ys5Error_pSgcSgtF>`. 

With async write, you don't need to pass a :ref:`thread-safe reference 
<ios-thread-safe-reference>` or :ref:`frozen objects <ios-frozen-objects>` 
across threads. Instead, call ``realm.writeAsync``. You can provide 
a completion block for the method to execute on the source thread after 
the write completes or fails.

Things to consider when performing background writes:

- Async writes block closing or invalidating the realm
- You can explicitly commit or cancel transactions

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadWriteData.snippet.async-transaction.swift
   :language: swift

Wait for Async Writes to Complete
`````````````````````````````````

The SDK provides a ``Bool`` to signal whether the {+realm+} is currently 
performing an async write. The
:swift-sdk:`isPerformingAsynchronousWriteOperations 
<Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V39isPerformingAsynchronousWriteOperationsSbvp>` 
variable becomes ``true`` after a call to one of:

- ``writeAsync``
- ``beginAsyncWrite``
- ``commitAsyncWrite``

It remains true until all scheduled async write operations have completed.
While this is true, this blocks closing or :swift-sdk:`invalidating 
<Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V10invalidateyyF>` the {+realm+}.

Commit or Cancel an Async Write
```````````````````````````````

To complete an async write, you or the SDK must call either:

- :swift-sdk:`commitAsyncWrite <Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V16commitAsyncWrite13allowGrouping_s6UInt32VSb_ys5Error_pSgcSgtF>` 
- :swift-sdk:`cancelAsyncWrite <Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V16cancelAsyncWriteyys6UInt32VKF>`

When you use the ``writeAsync`` method, the SDK handles committing or 
canceling the transaction. This provides the convenience of the async write 
without the need to manually keep state tied to the scope of the object. 
However, while in the writeAsync block, you *can* explicitly call 
``commitAsyncWrite`` or ``cancelAsyncWrite``. If you return without 
calling one of these methods, ``writeAsync`` either:

- Commits the write after executing the instructions in the write block
- Returns an error

In either case, this completes the ``writeAsync`` operation.

For more control over when to commit or cancel the async write transaction, 
use the ``beginAsyncWrite`` method. When you use this method, you must 
explicitly commit the transactions. Returning without committing an async 
write cancels the transaction. ``beginAsyncWrite`` returns an ID that you 
can pass to ``cancelAsyncWrite``.

``commitAsyncWrite`` asynchronously commits a write transaction. This is
the step that persists the data to the {+realm+}. ``commitAsyncWrite`` can
take an ``onComplete`` block. . This block executes on the source thread 
once the commit completes or fails with an error. 

Calling ``commitAsyncWrite`` immediately returns. This allows the caller 
to proceed while the SDK performs the I/O on a background thread. This method 
returns an ID that you can pass to ``cancelAsyncWrite``. This cancels the 
pending invocation of the completion block. It does not cancel the commit 
itself.

You can group sequential calls to ``commitAsyncWrite``. Batching these calls 
improves write performance; particularly when the batched transactions are 
small. To permit grouping transactions, set the ``isGroupingAllowed`` 
parameter to ``true``.

You can call ``cancelAsyncWrite`` on either ``beginAsyncWrite`` or 
``commitAsyncWrite``. When you call it on ``beginAsyncWrite``, this cancels
the entire write transaction. When you call it on ``commitAsyncWrite``, this 
cancels only an ``onComplete`` block you may have passed to 
``commitAsyncWrite``. It does not cancel the commit itself. You need the ID
of the ``beginAsyncWrite`` or the ``commitAsyncWrite`` you want to cancel.

.. _ios-modify-an-object:

Modify an Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can modify properties of a Realm object inside of a write
transaction in the same way that you would update any other Swift or
Objective-C object.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadWriteData.snippet.update.m
         :language: objectivec


.. tip:: Update Related and Embedded Objects

   To update a property of an :ref:`embedded object
   <ios-define-an-embedded-object-property>` or a :ref:`related object
   <ios-declare-relationship-properties>`, modify the property with
   dot-notation or bracket-notation as if it were in a regular, nested
   object.

.. _ios-update-with-key-value-coding:

Update Properties with Key-value Coding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``Object``, ``Result``, and ``List`` all conform to 
:apple:`key-value coding <library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueCoding/>`. 
This can be useful when you need to determine which property to update 
at runtime.

Applying KVC to a collection is a great way to update objects in bulk. 
Avoid the overhead of iterating over a collection while creating 
accessors for every item.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadWriteData.snippet.key-value-coding.swift
   :language: swift

.. tip::

   You can also add values for embedded objects or relationships this
   way. See :ref:`ios-initialize-an-object-with-a-value`.

.. _ios-upsert-an-object:

Upsert an Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An **upsert** either inserts or updates an object depending on whether
the object already exists. Upserts require the data model to have a
:ref:`primary key <ios-specify-a-primary-key>`.

.. tabs-realm-languages::
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      To upsert an object, call :swift-sdk:`Realm.add(_:update:)
      <Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V3add_6updateySo0aB6ObjectC_AC12UpdatePolicyOtF>`
      with the second parameter, update policy, set to ``.modified``.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadWriteData.snippet.upsert.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      To upsert an object, call :objc-sdk:`-[RLMRealm
      addOrUpdateObject:]
      <Classes/RLMRealm.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMRealm(im)addOrUpdateObject:>`.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadWriteData.snippet.upsert.m
         :language: objectivec

You can also partially update an object by passing the primary key and a
subset of the values to update:

.. _ios-delete-an-object:

Delete an Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs-realm-languages::
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      To delete an object from a realm, pass the object to
      :swift-sdk:`Realm.delete(_:)
      <Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V6deleteyySo13RLMObjectBaseCF>`
      inside of a write transaction.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadWriteData.snippet.delete.swift

      inside of a write transaction.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadWriteData.snippet.delete.m
         :language: objectivec

.. important:: Do not use objects after delete

   You cannot access or modify an object after you have deleted it from

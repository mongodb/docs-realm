.. _ios-open-a-synced-realm:

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you can access a synced {+realm+} from the client, you must:

1. :ref:`Enable sync <enable-sync>` in the {+ui+}.

#. :ref:`Initialize the app <ios-quick-start-init-app>`

#. :ref:`Authenticate a user <ios-quick-start-authenticate>` in
   your client project.

#. :ref:`Open a Synced Realm <ios-login-and-open-realm>`

Sync Data
---------

The syntax to :ref:`read <ios-read-operations>`, :ref:`write
<ios-write-operations>`, and
:ref:`watch for changes <ios-react-to-changes>` on a
synced {+realm+} is identical to the syntax for non-synced {+realms+}. While 
you work with local data, a background thread efficiently integrates, 
uploads, and downloads changesets.

.. important:: When Using Sync, Avoid Writes on the Main Thread

   The fact that {+service-short+} performs sync integrations on a background thread means
   that if you write to your {+realm+} on the main thread, there's a small chance your UI
   could appear to hang as it waits for the background sync thread to finish a write
   transaction. Therefore, it's a best practice :ref:`not to write on the main thread
   when using {+sync+} <ios-threading-three-rules>`.

The following code creates a new ``Task`` object and writes it to the {+realm+}:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/CompleteQuickStart.snippet.create-task.swift
   :language: swift

.. seealso::

   :ref:`Threading <ios-client-threading>`

.. _ios-sync-changes-in-the-background:

Sync Changes in the Background
------------------------------

If you want your app to update data in the background (while the app is
minimized), iOS requires you to implement :apple:`Background App Refresh
<documentation/uikit/app_and_environment/scenes/preparing_your_ui_to_run_in_the_background/updating_your_app_with_background_app_refresh>`.
Enabling Background App Refresh minimizes the time it takes for the user
to see the most recent data; without Background App Refresh, {+service+}
updates the data when the user launches the app, potentially resulting
in noticeable lag.

To use the {+realm+} while the device is locked, you must adjust the
file protection settings. See
:ref:`use-realm-when-the-device-is-locked`.

.. _ios-suspend-or-resume-a-sync-session:

Suspend or Resume a Sync Session
--------------------------------

Opening a synced {+realm+} starts a :swift-sdk:`SyncSession <Extensions/SyncSession.html>`
for that {+realm+}. You can suspend and resume the sync session on the {+realm+}.
Pausing a sync session only suspends that {+realm+}'s sync session. If you have
more than one open {+realm+}, suspend does not affect the sync sessions for 
other {+realms+}.

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      You can suspend or resume a sync session using the
      :swift-sdk:`SyncSession <Extensions/SyncSession.html>` instance of
      a synced {+realm+}.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Sync.snippet.pause-resume-sync-session.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      You can suspend or resume a sync session using the
      :objc-sdk:`RLMSyncSession <Classes/RLMSyncSession.html>` instance
      of a synced {+realm+}.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Sync.snippet.pause-resume-sync-session.m

.. _ios-check-sync-progress:

Check Upload & Download Progress for a Sync Session
---------------------------------------------------

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      You can add a progress notification using the synced {+realm+}'s
      SyncSession instance's
      :swift-sdk:`addProgressNotification(for:mode:block:)
      <Extensions/SyncSession.html#/s:So14RLMSyncSessionC10RealmSwiftE23addProgressNotification3for4mode5blockSo011RLMProgressG5TokenCSgAbCE0F9DirectionO_AbCE0F4ModeOyAbCE0F0VctF>`
      method.

      This method returns a token that you should retain until you wish
      to stop observing upload or download progress. Note that if you
      keep the token in a local variable, observation will stop when the
      local variable goes out of scope.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Sync.snippet.check-progress.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      You can add a progress notification using the synced {+realm+}'s
      RLMSyncSession instance's
      :objc-sdk:`[--addProgressNotificationForDirection:mode:block:]
      <Classes/RLMSyncSession.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMSyncSession(im)addProgressNotificationForDirection:mode:block:>`
      method.

      This method returns a token that you should retain until you wish
      to stop observing upload or download progress. Note that if you
      keep the token in a local variable, observation will stop when the
      local variable goes out of scope.

.. _ios-check-network-connection:

Check the Network Connection
----------------------------

.. tip:: 

   {+service+}'s *offline-first* design means that you generally don't
   need to check the current network connection state. That said, the
   ``connectionState`` property is available if your app calls for some
   indication of connection state.

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      To check the connection state, you can read the synced {+realm+}'s
      SyncSession instance's :swift-sdk:`connectionState
      <Extensions/SyncSession.html#/s:So14RLMSyncSessionC10RealmSwiftE15ConnectionStatea>`
      property directly. 

      This property is :apple:`KVO-compliant
      <library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueObserving/KeyValueObserving.html>`,
      so you can observe changes using KVO or even Combine.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Sync.snippet.check-network-connection.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      To check the connection state, you can read the synced {+realm+}'s
      RLMSyncSession instance's :objc-sdk:`connectionState
      <Classes/RLMSyncSession.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMSyncSession(py)connectionState>`
      property directly.

      This property is :apple:`KVO-compliant
      <library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueObserving/KeyValueObserving.html>`,
      so you can observe changes using KVO. The following example
      demonstrates how to implement an observer class:

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Sync.snippet.check-network-connection-setup.m
         :language: objectivec

      You can then attach an observer instance to the RLMSyncSession
      object. Be sure to remove the observer when finished.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Sync.snippet.check-network-connection.m
         :language: objectivec

.. _ios-handle-sync-errors:

Handle Sync Errors
------------------

While developing an application that uses {+sync+}, you should set an error
handler. This error handler will detect and respond to any failed sync-related
API calls. 

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      Set an error handler on the :swift-sdk:`SyncManager
      <Typealiases.html#/s:10RealmSwift11SyncManagera>` singleton. Set an error
      handler on the SyncManager singleton. When an error occurs, the Swift SDK
      calls the error handler with the error object and the :swift-sdk:`SyncSession
      <Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V11syncSessionSo07RLMSyncD0CSgvp>` that the
      error occurred on.
      
      .. note::
   
         Realm's :swift-sdk:`SyncError <Structs/Realm/Configuration.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V13ConfigurationV07defaultC0AEvpZ>` conforms to :apple:`Swift's Error protocol <documentation/swift/error>`

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/Errors.snippet.create-error-handler.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      Set an error handler on the :objc-sdk:`RLMSyncManager
      <objc/latest/Classes/RLMSyncManager.html>` singleton. When an error
      occurs, the Swift SDK calls the error handler with the error object and the
      :objc-sdk:`RLMSyncSession <objc/latest/Classes/RLMSyncSession.html>` that
      the error occurred on.

      .. note::
   
         Realm represents sync errors through :objc-sdk:`NSError <Categories/NSError%28RLMSync%29.html>` objects whose domain is
         :objc-sdk:`RLMSyncErrorDomain <Constants.html#/c:@RLMSyncErrorDomain>`. To learn more about the error codes, check out
         the definitions of :objc-sdk:`RLMSyncError <Enums/RLMSyncError.html>` and :objc-sdk:`RLMSyncAuthError <Enums/RLMSyncAuthError.html>`.

.. _ios-delete-a-client-realm-file:

Delete a Client Realm File
--------------------------

In some cases, you may want to completely delete a realm file from disk.

Realm avoids copying data into memory except when absolutely required.
As a result, all objects managed by a realm have references to the file
on disk. Before you can safely delete the file, you must ensure the
deallocation of these objects:

- All objects read from or added to the realm
- All List and Results objects
- All ThreadSafeReference objects
- The realm itself

In practice, there are two safe times to delete the realm file:

1. On application startup before ever opening the realm.
#. After only having opened the realm within an explicit ``autorelease`` pool, which ensures deallocation of all of objects within it.

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      You can delete the ``.realm``, ``.note`` and ``.management`` files
      for a given configuration with the
      :swift-sdk:`Realm.deleteFiles(for:)
      <Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V11deleteFiles3forSbAC13ConfigurationV_tKFZ>`
      class method.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Sync.snippet.reset-client-realm-file.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      You can delete the ``.realm``, ``.note`` and ``.management`` files
      for a given configuration with the :objc-sdk:`+[RLMRealm
      deleteFilesForConfiguration:error:]
      <Classes/RLMRealm.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMRealm(cm)deleteFilesForConfiguration:error:>`
      class method.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Sync.snippet.reset-client-realm-file.m
         :language: objectivec

.. tip::

   To perform a **client reset**, see :ref:`ios-client-resets`.

.. _ios-set-the-client-log-level:

Set the Client Log Level
------------------------

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      You can set the {+sync+} client log level on the
      :swift-sdk:`SyncManager
      <Typealiases.html#/s:10RealmSwift11SyncManagera>` instance on your
      :swift-sdk:`App <Extensions/App.html>`.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Sync.snippet.set-log-level.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      You can set the {+sync+} client log level on the
      :objc-sdk:`RLMSyncManager <Classes/RLMSyncManager.html>` instance
      on your :objc-sdk:`RLMApp <Classes/RLMApp.html>`.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Sync.snippet.set-log-level.m
         :language: objectivec

.. tip::

   See :objc-sdk:`RLMSyncLogLevel <Enums/RLMSyncLogLevel.html>` for a
   description of each available log level. Note that more logging can
   negatively affect performance.

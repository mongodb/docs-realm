.. _ios-read-user-metadata:

Read a Userâ€™s Metadata
----------------------

You can read the :ref:`user metadata <user-metadata>` of a
currently logged-in user through that user's ``User`` object. You cannot
edit user metadata through a ``User`` object. 

To read the data, access the ``profile`` property on the ``User`` object 
of a logged-in user:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Authenticate.codeblock.read-user-metadata.swift
   :language: swift

User metadata options vary depending on which provider you're using and
:ref:`which metadata fields you enable <configure-user-metadata-on-the-backend>`. 

.. warning:: User Metadata May Be Stale
   
   {+backend+} fetches the most recent version of user metadata when a user
   logs in. If the user changes their email address or profile photo with a 
   login provider, for example, those changes do not update in user metadata 
   until the user logs in again. Because we cache credentials and enable you 
   to bypass the login flow, user metadata may become stale unless you 
   force the user to log in again.

.. _ios-configure-user-metadata:

Configure User Metadata
-----------------------

You can only read user metadata from the client app that you have configured
on the {+backend+} application.

You can configure the :ref:`user metadata <user-metadata>` you request from 
an authentication provider. You do this directly on the authentication 
provider's configuration. For more details on which metadata fields you 
can use, see the provider details:

- OAuth 2.0 (:doc:`Facebook </authentication/facebook>` & :doc:`Google </authentication/google>`)
- :doc:`Custom JWT </authentication/custom-jwt>`

You can change which metadata fields you have configured by :ref:`editing the 
provider's configuration <configure-user-metadata-on-the-backend>`.

.. _ios-update-user-metadata:

Update User Metadata
--------------------

User metadata that you access through the authentication provider is read-only
data. You cannot update or edit user metadata that comes from this source.

If you would like to give a user the option the update their metadata from 
within your client {+app+}, use :ref:`custom user data <custom-user-data>`, 
instead.

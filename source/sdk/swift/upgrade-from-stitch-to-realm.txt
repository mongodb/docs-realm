Overview
--------
If you have an existing app built with the Stitch SDK, you should migrate your
app to use the new Realm SDK.  While much of the application logic and flow of
information hasn't changed, there are a few changes to how the SDK connects to the
{+realm+} backend.

New Features
------------

- The {+service-short+} Swift SDK supports iOS applications written in Objective-C.

- The {+service-short+} Swift SDK now includes {+client-database+}, which includes
  local object storage and :ref:`{+sync+}
  <ios-sync-changes-between-devices>`.

   * - What's Changed?
     - Solution
   
   * - The backend app connections previously accessed via `StitchAppClient <http://stitch-sdks.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/stitch-sdks/swift/6/Protocols/StitchAppClient.html>`__ are now available through :swift-sdk:`App <Extensions/App.html>`. Use ``App`` to access authentication functionality such as logging in and getting the current user. 

     - Migrate all occurrences of ``StitchAppClient`` to ``App``.

   * - `StitchUser <http://stitch-sdks.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/stitch-sdks/swift/6/Protocols/StitchUser.html>`__ was previously the interface to access application users, but now it is :swift-sdk:`User <Extensions/User.html>`.
     - Migrate all occurrences of ``StitchUser`` to ``User``.

   * - The login API has changed from `client.auth.login() <http://stitch-sdks.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/stitch-sdks/swift/6/Protocols/StitchAuth.html#/s:10StitchCore0A4AuthP5login14withCredential_y0aB3SDK0aF0_p_yAA0A6ResultOyAA0A4User_pGctF>`__ to :swift-sdk:`App.login() <Extensions/App.html#/s:So6RLMAppC10RealmSwiftE5login11credentials7Combine6FutureCySo7RLMUserCs5Error_pGSo14RLMCredentialsC_tF>`
     - Rewrite all authentication logic to use the :ref:`new login API <ios-authenticate-users>`.

   * - The API to log users out has changed from `StitchAppClient.auth.logout() <http://stitch-sdks.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/stitch-sdks/swift/6/Protocols/StitchAuth.html#/s:10StitchCore0A4AuthP6logoutyyyAA0A6ResultOyytGcF>`__ to :swift-sdk:`User.logOut() <Extensions/User.html#/s:So7RLMUserC10RealmSwiftE6logOut7Combine6FutureCyyts5Error_pGyF>`.
     - Rewrite the application logic to log out using the ``User`` object's ``logOut()`` method.

   * - The Stitch SDK defined credentials through functions named after the credential type, i.e., ``AnonymousCredential()`` for an `anonymous credential <http://stitch-sdks.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/stitch-sdks/swift/6/Structs/AnonymousCredential.html>`__. The Realm SDK has a class, :swift-sdk:`Credentials <Typealiases.html#/s:10RealmSwift11Credentialsa>`, with methods or enums for each credential type, i.e., ``Credentials.emailPassword()``.
     - Use the Realm SDK's ``Credentials`` class to create authentication credentials.
 
   * - The API to call a {+service-short+} function has changed from `stitchAppClient.callFunction() <http://stitch-sdks.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/stitch-sdks/swift/6/Protocols/StitchAppClient.html#/s:10StitchCore0A9AppClientP12callFunction8withName0G4Args_ySS_Say10MongoSwift9BSONValue_pGyAA0A6ResultOyqd__GctSeRd__lF>`__ to :swift-sdk:`app.currentUser?.functions.{myFunction}() <Extensions/User.html#/s:So7RLMUserC10RealmSwiftE9functionsAC9FunctionsVvp>`, where ``{myFunction}`` is the name of the function.
     - Replace {+service-short+} function calls with the new API method, ``app.currentUser?.functions.{myFunction}()`` 

   * - The interface to the MongoDB Data Access API, containing objects like :swift-sdk:`MongoDatabase <Typealiases.html#/s:10RealmSwift13MongoDatabasea>`, and :swift-sdk:`MongoCollection <Extensions/MongoCollection.html>`, has changed. Through Stitch, passing the `remoteMongoClientFactory <http://stitch-sdks.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/stitch-sdks/swift/6/Remote%20MongoDB%20Service.html#/s:26StitchRemoteMongoDBService06remoteC13ClientFactory0A4Core023AnyNamedThrowingServicefG0VyAA0bcF0CGvp>`__ and the string "mongodb-atlas" to `StitchAppClient.serviceClient() <http://stitch-sdks.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/stitch-sdks/swift/6/Protocols/StitchAppClient.html#/s:10StitchCore0A9AppClientP07serviceD015withServiceNameAA0agD0_pSS_tF>`__ creates a remote Mongodb client. The Realm Swift SDK creates a remote MongoDB client through the :swift-sdk:`mongoClient <Typealiases.html#/s:10RealmSwift11MongoClienta>` method on the logged-in user object.
     - Replace all ``mongoClient`` instantiations with ``app.currentUser!.mongoClient()``.
   
   * - The  {+service-short+} SDKs do not provide an interface for calling Services (like the :ref:`Twilio <twilio-service>` and :ref:`AWS <aws-service>` services).
     -  Convert uses of Third Party Services in your Stitch Application to Realm functions in your Realm application using the AWS and/or Twilio npm packages. For more information, see :ref:`Add External Dependencies <add-external-dependencies>`.

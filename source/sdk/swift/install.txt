Overview
--------

Realm's Swift SDK enables your iOS, macOS, tvOS,
and watchOS applications to interact with Realm using either
the Swift or Objective-C programming languages. This page
details how to install Realm in your project and get
started.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before getting started, ensure your development environment
meets the following prerequisites:

- `Xcode <https://developer.apple.com/xcode/>`__ version 13.1 or higher.
- When using Xcode 13, a target of iOS 9.0 or higher, macOS 10.9 or higher, tvOS 9.0 or higher, or watchOS 2.0 or higher.
- If using Swift Package Manager with Xcode 13, target of iOS 11+ or macOS 10.10+ is required.
- When using Xcode 14, a target of iOS 11.0 or higher, macOS 10.13 or higher, tvOS 11.0 or higher, or watchOS 4.0 or higher.

.. important::

   There are special considerations when using Realm Database with
   tvOS. See :ref:`ios-tvos` for more information.

Installation
------------

You can use ``SwiftPM``, ``CocoaPods``, or ``Carthage`` to add the
Realm Swift SDK to your project.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: SwiftPM
      :tabid: swiftpm

      .. include:: /includes/steps/install-swiftpm.rst

   .. tab:: CocoaPods
      :tabid: cocoapods

      If you are installing with `CocoaPods <https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html>`__, you need CocoaPods 1.10.1 or later.

      .. include:: /includes/steps/install-cocoapods.rst

   .. tab:: Carthage
      :tabid: carthage

      If you are installing with `Carthage <https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#installing-carthage>`__, you need Carthage 0.33 or later.

      .. include:: /includes/steps/install-carthage.rst

   .. tab:: Static Framework
      :tabid: static-framework

      Installing the Realm Swift SDK as a static framework is only available
      for iOS targets.

      .. include:: /includes/steps/install-swift-static-framework.rst
       
      .. tip::
      
         If using the Realm Objective-C API within a Swift project, we 
         recommend you include both Realm Swift and Realm Objective-C in your 
         project. Within your Swift files, you can access the Swift API and 
         all required wrappers. Using the RealmSwift API in mixed 
         Swift/Objective-C projects is possible because the vast majority of 
         RealmSwift types are directly aliased from their Objective-C 
         counterparts.

Import Realm
------------

Add the following line at the top of your source files
to use Realm:

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/MyRealmApp.snippet.import-realm.m
         :language: objectivec

   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/RealmApp.snippet.import-realm.swift
         :language: swift

.. _ios-app-download-file-size:

App Download File Size
----------------------

Realm Database should only add around 5 to 8 MB to your app's download 
size. The releases we distribute are significantly larger because they 
include support for the iOS, watchOS and tvOS simulators, some debug symbols, 
and bitcode, all of which are stripped by the App Store automatically when 
apps are downloaded.

Troubleshooting
---------------

If you have build issues after using one of these methods to install 
Realm, see :ref:`our troubleshooting guidelines <ios-resolve-build-issues>` 
for information about resolving those issues realm.

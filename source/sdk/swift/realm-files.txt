A **realm** is the core data structure used to organize data in
Realm Database. A realm is a collection of the objects that you use 
in your application, called Realm objects, as well as additional metadata 
that describe the objects. To learn how to define a Realm object, see
:ref:`Define an Object Model <ios-define-a-realm-object-schema>`.

.. _ios-realm-file:

Realm Files
-----------

Realm Database stores a binary encoded version of every object and type in a
realm in a single ``.realm`` file. The file is located at :ref:`a specific 
path <ios-default-and-file-url-realm>` that you can define when you open the 
realm. You can open, view, and edit the contents of these files with 
:ref:`realm-studio`.

.. see:: Auxiliary Realm Files
   
   Realm Database creates additional files for each realm.
   To learn more about these files, see :ref:`Realm Database Internals
   <ios-realm-database>`. Deleting these files has important implications.
   For more information about deleting ``.realm`` or auxiliary files, see: 
   :ref:`Delete a Realm <swift-delete-a-realm>`

.. _ios-in-memory-realm:

In-Memory Realms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also open a realm entirely in memory, which does not create a ``.realm``
file or its associated auxiliary files. Instead the SDK stores objects in memory
while the realm is open and discards them immediately when all instances are
closed.

.. see:: Open an In-Memory Realm

   To open an in-memory realm, refer to :ref:`ios-open-an-in-memory-realm`.

.. _ios-default-realm:

Default Realm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Calling :swift-sdk:`Realm()<Structs/Realm.html>` or 
:objc-sdk:`RLMRealm<Classes/RLMRealm.html>` opens the default realm. 
This method returns a realm object that maps to a file named 
``default.realm``. You can find this file:

- iOS: in the Documents folder of your app
- macOS: in the Application Support folder of your app

.. see:: Open a Default Realm

   To open a default realm, refer to :ref:`ios-default-and-file-url-realm`.

Find a Realm File Path
----------------------

The realm file is located at a specific path that you can optionally define 
when you open the realm.

.. include:: /includes/find-realm-file-swift.rst

.. see:: Open a Realm at a Path

   To open a realm at a specific path, refer to :ref:`ios-default-and-file-url-realm`.

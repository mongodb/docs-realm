.. _ios-create-user:

Create a User
-------------

For most :ref:`authentication methods <authentication-providers>`, Atlas App Services 
automatically creates a :ref:`user object <user-objects>` the first time 
a user authenticates. The only exception is email/password authentication. 
When you use email/password authentication, you must :ref:`register 
<ios-register-a-new-user-account>` and :ref:`confirm 
<ios-confirm-a-new-users-email-address>` a user before the user can 
authenticate to an Atlas App Services application.

.. _ios-delete-user:

Delete a User
-------------

.. versionadded:: 10.23.0

You can call the :swift-sdk:`delete 
<Extensions/User.html#/s:So7RLMUserC10RealmSwiftE6delete7Combine6FutureCyyts5Error_pGyF>` 
method on a user object to delete the user object from your App. 
This deletes the object from the server in addition to clearing local data.

.. important::

   Deleting a user only deletes the user object, which may contain associated 
   :ref:`metadata <ios-user-metadata>`. This does not delete :ref:`custom 
   user data <ios-custom-user-data>` or user-entered data from your 
   application. Apple :apple:`requires that you disclose data retention 
   and deletion policies <app-store/review/guidelines/#5.1.1>` to your 
   application customers and give them a way to request user data deletion.
   If you collect additional user data, you must implement your own methods 
   or processes to delete that data.

Delete Users with Async/Await
-----------------------------

If your application uses :apple:`Apple's async/await syntax
<documentation/swift/swift_standard_library/concurrency/updating_an_app_to_use_swift_concurrency>`:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/DeleteUsers.snippet.async-await-delete-user.swift
   :language: swift

.. include:: /includes/swift-async-await-support.rst

Delete Users with Completion Handlers
-------------------------------------

If your application does not use async/await:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/DeleteUsers.snippet.closure-delete-user.swift
   :language: swift

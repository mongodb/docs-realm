Overview
--------

When you update your object schema, you must increment the schema version 
and perform a migration. 

For information on how to actually perform the migration, see:
:ref:`Change an Object Model <ios-modify-an-object-schema>`.

This page focuses on how to use migrated data in SwiftUI Views.

Use Migrated Data with SwiftUI
------------------------------

To perform a migration:

- Update your schema and write a migration block, if required
- Specify a :swift-sdk:`Realm.Configuration <Structs/Realm/Configuration.html>`
  that uses this migration logic and/or updated schema version when you 
  initialize your realm.

From here, you have two options to pass the configuration object. You can either:

- Use environment injection to provide this configuration to the first view 
  in your hierarchy that uses Realm
- Explicitly provide the configuration to a Realm property wrapper that takes
  a configuration object, such as ``@ObservedResults`` or ``@AsyncOpen``.

.. example:: 

   For example, you might want to add a property to an existing object. We
   could add a ``favoriteTreat`` property to the ``Dog`` object in DoggoDB:

   .. code-block:: swift
      :copyable: false

      @Persisted var favoriteTreat = ""

   After you add your new property to the schema, you must increment the 
   schema version. Your ``Realm.Configuration`` might look like this:

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/swiftui/SyncOrLocalRealm.snippet.update-schema-version.swift
      :language: swift
      :copyable: false

   Declare this configuration somewhere that is accessible to the first view 
   in the hierarchy that needs it. Declaring this above your ``@main`` app 
   entrypoint makes it available everywhere, but you could also put it in 
   the file where you first open a realm.

Pass the Configuration Object as an Environment Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have declared the configuration, you can inject it as an environment 
object to the first view in your hierarchy that opens a realm. If you are 
using the ``@ObservedResults`` or ``@ObservedRealmObject`` property wrappers, 
these views implicitly open a realm, so they also need access to this 
configuration.

.. code-block:: swift
   :copyable: false

   .environment(\.realmConfiguration, config)

If your app uses either a local or a Synced realm, the first view in the 
hiearchy that opens a realm varies depending on whether you're using the 
app with or without Sync.

Without sync, you can pass the realm configuration environment object directly
to the ``LocalOnlyContentView``: 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/swiftui/SyncOrLocalRealm.snippet.pass-config-environment-object.swift
   :language: swift

Which opens a realm implicitly with:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/swiftui/PassObjectsToView.snippet.local-only-view.swift
   :language: swift

However, when your app uses Sync, you the Realm explicitly using the 
``@AsyncOpen`` or ``@AutoOpen`` property wrapper:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/swiftui/OpenRealm.snippet.open-realm-view-flex-sync.swift
   :language: swift

So you must pass the environment object to the view that explicitly 
opens the realm. In this case, the ``OpenFlexibleSyncRealmView``.

The important thing to remember is to make sure to pass the 
``Realm.Configuration`` that encompasses your migration logic to any view 
hierarchy that implicitly or explicitly opens a realm.

Explicitly Pass the Updated Configuration to a Realm SwiftUI Property Wrapper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can explicitly pass the configuration object to a Realm SwiftUI
property wrapper that takes a configuration object, such as ``@ObservedResults``
or ``@AutoOpen``. In this case, you might pass it directly to ``@ObservedResults``
in our ``DogsView``.

.. code-block:: swift

   @ObservedResults(Dog.self, configuration: config) var dogs

Perform a Quick Write
---------------------

In addition to performing writes inside a transaction block, the Realm Swift 
SDK offers a convenience feature to enable quick writes without explicitly 
performing a write transaction.

When you use the ``@ObservedRealmObject`` or ``@ObservedResults`` property 
wrappers, you can implicitly open a write transaction. Use the ``$`` operator
to create a two-way binding to the state object. Then, when you make changes 
to the bound object or collection, you initiate an implicit write.

Update an Object's Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this example, we create a two-way binding with one of the state object's
properties. ``$dog.favoriteToy`` creates a binding to the model Dog 
object's ``favoriteToy`` property

When the app user updates that field in this example, Realm Database
opens an implicit write transaction and saves the new value to the database.

Update an ObservedResults Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this example, we create a two-way binding with an 
:swift-sdk:`ObservedResults <Structs/ObservedResults.html>` collection.
The ``$dogs.remove`` in the ``onDelete`` and the ``$dogs.append`` in the 
``addDogButton`` write directly to the ``@ObservedResults`` collection.
While a regular :ref:`Realm Results collection <ios-results-collections>`
is immutable, ObservedResults is a mutable collection that allows you to 
perform writes using the two-way binding. When you update the 
bound collection, Realm Database opens an implicit write transaction and 
saves the changes to the collection.

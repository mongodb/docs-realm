Realm vs Other Databases
------------------------

The Realm data model is similar to both relational and
document databases but has distinct differences from both. To underscore
these differences, it's helpful to highlight what a realm **is
not**:

A realm is not a single, application-wide database.
    Applications based on other database systems generally store all of their
    data in a single database. Apps often split data across multiple
    realms to organize data more efficiently and to enforce access controls.

A realm is not a relational table.
    Normalized tables in relational databases only store one type of
    information, such as street addresses or items in a store inventory. A
    realm can contain any number of object types that are relevant to a
    given domain.

A realm is not a collection of schemaless documents.
    Document databases don't necessarily enforce a strict schema for the data in
    each collection. While similar to documents in form, every Realm object
    conforms to a schema for a specific object type in the realm. An object
    cannot contain a property that is not described by its schema.

Live Queries
------------

You can read back the data that you have :ref:`stored
<ios-write-transactions>` in Realm Database by finding,
filtering, and sorting objects.

To get the best performance from Realm as your app grows and your
queries become more complex, design your app's data access patterns
around a solid understanding of Realm Database :ref:`read
characteristics <ios-realm-read-characteristics>`.

.. _ios-live-object:

Live Object
~~~~~~~~~~~

All Realm objects are **live objects**, which means they
automatically update whenever they're modified. Realm emits a
:ref:`notification event <ios-react-to-changes>` whenever any property
changes.

You can use live objects to work with object-oriented data natively
without an :wikipedia:`ORM <Object-relational_mapping>` tool. Live
objects are direct proxies to the underlying stored data, which means
that a live object doesn't directly contain data. Instead, a live object
always references the most up-to-date data on disk and :wikipedia:`lazy
loads <Lazy_loading>` property values when you access them from a
:ref:`collection <ios-client-collections>`. This means that a realm
can contain many objects but only pay the performance cost for data that
the application is actually using.

Valid write operations on a live object automatically persist to the
realm and propagate to any other synced clients. You do not need to
call an update method, modify the realm, or otherwise "push"
updates.

Realm Swift SDK Examples
------------------------

Each of the pages in the Swift SDK documentation contain example code showing
a specific task. The Quick Starts folder contains several example applications
you can run to experiment with different ways of using Realm Database.

Beyond the examples in this documentation, the Realm community 
has created many applications that demonstrate the usage of the 
Realm Swift SDK.

.. note:: 

   These community examples are not part of the documentation, and may not
   be actively maintained or show the most up-to-date way of working with Realm. 

Examples by the Realm Engineering Team
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The :github:`realm-swift example applications
<realm/realm-swift/tree/master/examples>` provide examples for both iOS and
macOS that demonstrate how to use Realm features such as migrations
and encryption. The examples also demonstrate how to combine Realm
with common iOS concepts like ``UITableViewController``.

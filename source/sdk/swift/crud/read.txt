.. _ios-read-from-realm:

Key Concept: Read from Realm Database
-------------------------------------

A read from a realm generally consists of the following
steps:

- Get all :ref:`objects <ios-realm-objects>` of a certain type from the realm.
- Optionally, :ref:`filter <ios-filter-data>` the results.
- Optionally, :ref:`sort <ios-sort-query-results>` the results.

All query, filter, and sort operations return a
:ref:`results collection <ios-results-collections>`. The results
collections are live, meaning they always contain the latest
results of the associated query.

.. _ios-realm-read-characteristics:

Read Characteristics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you design your app's data access patterns around the
following three key characteristics of reads in Realm Database,
you can be confident you are reading data as
efficiently as possible.

.. _ios-results-are-not-copies:

Results Are Not Copies
``````````````````````

Results to a query are not copies of your data: modifying
the results of a query will modify the data on disk
directly. This memory mapping also means that results are
**live**: that is, they always reflect the current state on
disk.

See also: :ref:`Collections are Live <ios-live-collections>`.

.. _ios-results-are-lazy:
.. _ios-lazy-evaluated-results:

Results Are Lazy
````````````````

Realm Database only runs a query when you actually request the
results of that query. This lazy evaluation enables you to write
elegant, highly performant code for handling large data sets and complex
queries. You can :ref:`chain several filter and sort operations
<ios-chain-queries>` without requiring extra work to process the
intermediate state.

.. _ios-references-retained:

References Are Retained
```````````````````````

One benefit of Realm Database's object model is that
Realm Database automatically retains all of an object's
:ref:`relationships <ios-client-relationships>` as direct
references, so you can traverse your graph of relationships
directly through the results of a query.

A **direct reference**, or pointer, allows you to access a
related object's properties directly through the reference.

Other databases typically copy objects from database storage
into application memory when you need to work with them
directly. Because application objects contain direct
references, you are left with a choice: copy the object
referred to by each direct reference out of the database in
case it's needed, or just copy the foreign key for each
object and query for the object with that key if it's
accessed. If you choose to copy referenced objects into
application memory, you can use up a lot of resources for
objects that are never accessed, but if you choose to only
copy the foreign key, referenced object lookups can cause
your application to slow down.

Realm Database bypasses all of this using zero-copy
live objects. Realm object accessors point
directly into database storage using memory mapping, so there is no
distinction between the objects in Realm Database and the results
of your query in application memory. Because of this, you can traverse
direct references across an entire realm from any query result.

.. _ios-limiting-results:

Limiting Query Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As a result of lazy evaluation, you do not need any special mechanism to
limit query results with Realm Database. For example, if your query
matches thousands of objects, but you only want to load the first ten,
simply access only the first ten elements of the results collection.

.. _ios-pagination:

Pagination
~~~~~~~~~~

Thanks to lazy evaluation, the common task of pagination becomes quite
simple. For example, suppose you have a results collection associated
with a query that matches thousands of objects in your realm. You
display one hundred objects per page. To advance to any page, simply
access the elements of the results collection starting at the index that
corresponds to the target page.

      If you know the :ref:`primary key <ios-specify-a-primary-key>` for
      a given object, you can look it up directly with
      :objc-sdk:`+[RLMObject objectForPrimaryKey:]
      <Classes/RLMObject.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMObject(cm)objectForPrimaryKey:>`.

.. _ios-query-all-objects-of-a-given-type:

Query All Objects of a Given Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs-realm-languages::
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      To query for objects of a given type in a realm, pass the metatype
      instance ``YourClassName.self`` to :swift-sdk:`Realm.objects(_:)
      <Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V7objectsyAA7ResultsVyxGxmSo0aB6ObjectCRbzlF>`.
      This returns a :swift-sdk:`Results <Structs/Results.html>` object
      representing all objects of the given type in the realm.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadRealmObjects.snippet.objects.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      To query for objects of a given type in a realm, pass the realm
      instance to :objc-sdk:`+[YourRealmObjectClass allObjectsInRealm:]
      <Classes/RLMObject.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMObject(cm)allObjectsInRealm:>`.
      Replace ``YourRealmObjectClass`` with your Realm object class
      name. This returns an :objc-sdk:`RLMResults
      <Classes/RLMResults.html>` object representing all objects of the
      given type in the realm.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadWriteData.snippet.objects.m
         :language: objectivec


.. _ios-filter-queries-based-on-object-properties:

Filter Queries Based on Object Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A filter selects a subset of results based on the value(s) of one or
more object properties. Realm Database provides a full-featured 
:ref:`query engine <ios-client-query-engine>` that you can use to define filters.

.. tabs::
   
   .. tab:: Realm Swift Query API
      :tabid: swift

      .. versionadded:: 10.19.0

      To use the :ref:`Realm Database Swift Query API <ios-realm-swift-query-api>`, 
      call :swift-sdk:`.where <Structs/Query.html>` with a closure that 
      contains a query expression as an argument.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadRealmObjects.snippet.where.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab:: Swift NSPredicate
      :tabid: swift-nspredicate

      To filter, call :swift-sdk:`Results.filter(_:)
      <Structs/Results.html#/s:10RealmSwift7ResultsV6filteryACyxGSo11NSPredicateCF>`
      with a query predicate.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadRealmObjects.snippet.filter.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab:: Objective C
      :tabid: objective-c

      To filter, call :objc-sdk:`-[RLMResults objectsWhere:]
      <Classes/RLMResults.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMResults(im)objectsWhere:>`
      with a query predicate.
      
      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadWriteData.snippet.filter.m
         :language: objectivec


.. tip:: Filter on Related and Embedded Object Properties

   To filter a query based on a property of an :ref:`embedded object
   <ios-define-an-embedded-object-property>` or a :ref:`related object
   <ios-declare-relationship-properties>`, use dot-notation as if it were
   in a regular, nested object.

.. _ios-filter-object-id:

Filter on Object ID Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The types in your predicate must match the types of the
properties. Avoid comparing
:swift-sdk:`ObjectId <Classes/ObjectId.html>` properties to strings, as
Realm Database does not automatically convert strings to ObjectIds.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Realm Swift Query API
      :tabid: swift

      .. versionadded:: 10.19.0

      The Realm Swift Query API's built-in type safety simplifies writing a
      query with an ObjectId:

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadRealmObjects.snippet.tsq-object-id.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab:: Swift NSPredicate
      :tabid: swift-nspredicate

      The following example shows the correct and incorrect way to write a
      query with an ObjectId given the following Realm Database object:

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadRealmObjects.snippet.query-object-id.swift
         :language: swift

.. _ios-query-a-relationship:

Query a Relationship
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can query through a relationship the same way you would access a
member of a regular Swift or Objective-C object.

.. tabs-realm-languages::
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift
      
      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadRealmObjects.snippet.query-a-relationship.swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c
      
      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadWriteData.snippet.query-a-relationship.m
         :language: objectivec


.. _ios-query-an-inverse-relationship:

Query an Inverse Relationship
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can query through an inverse relationship the same way you would
access a member of a regular Swift or Objective-C object.

.. tabs-realm-languages::
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift
      
      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadRealmObjects.snippet.query-an-inverse-relationship.swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c
      
      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadWriteData.snippet.query-an-inverse-relationship.m
         :language: objectivec

Query a Collection on Embedded Object Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use dot notation to filter or sort a :ref:`collection
<ios-client-collections>` of objects based on an embedded object
property value:

.. include:: /includes/directly-query-embedded-objects-note.rst

.. tabs::
   

   .. tab:: Realm Swift Query API

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/EmbeddedObjects/QueryEmbeddedObjects.m
         :language: objectivec

.. _swift-query-and-iterate-map:

Query a Map Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can iterate and check the values of a realm :swift-sdk:`map <Classes/Map.html>` 
as you would a standard :apple:`Dictionary <documentation/swift/dictionary>`:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadRealmObjects.snippet.map.swift
   :language: swift

.. _swift-query-mutableset-property:

Query a MutableSet Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can query a :swift-sdk:`MutableSet <Classes/MutableSet.html>` to check if
it contains an element. If you are working with multiple sets, you can 
check for the intersection of two sets, or check whether one set is a subset
of the other set.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadRealmObjects.snippet.set-collections.swift
   :language: swift

.. _swift-read-anyrealmvalue-property:

Read and Query AnyRealmValue Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you read an AnyRealmValue property, check the value's type before doing
anything with it. The Realm Swift SDK provides an :swift-sdk:`AnyRealmValue 
enum <Enums/AnyRealmValue.html>` that iterates through all of the types the 
AnyRealmValue can store.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadRealmObjects.snippet.mixed-data-type.swift
   :language: swift

You can :ref:`compare <ios-filter-data-operators>` these mixed value types:

- Numeric: int, bool, float, double, decimal
- Byte-based: string, binary
- Time-based: timestamp, objectId

When using the ``AnyRealmValue`` mixed data type, keep these things in mind:

- ``equals`` queries match on value and type
- ``not equals`` queries match objects with either different values or 
  different types
- realm converts comparable numeric properties where possible. For example,
  in a mixed type field, 1 matches all of 1.0, 1, and true.
- String properties do not match numeric queries. For example, in a mixed
  type field, 1 does not match "1". "1" does not match 1, 1.0, or true.

.. _swift-query-type-projection:

Query a Custom Persistable Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you use :ref:`type projection <ios-type-projection>` to map unsupported 
types to supported types, accessing those properties is often based on the 
persisted type. 

Queries on Realm Objects
````````````````````````

When working with projected types, queries operate on the persisted type. 
However, you can use the mapped types interchangeably with the persisted 
types in arguments in most cases. The exception is queries on embedded 
objects.

.. tip::

   Projected types support :ref:`sorting and aggregates <ios-filter-data>` where 
   the persisted type supports them.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/TypeProjection.snippet.query-objects-with-type-projection.swift
   :language: swift

Queries on Embedded Objects
```````````````````````````

You can query embedded types on the supported property types within the 
object using memberwise equality. 

Object link properties support equality comparisons, but do not support 
memberwise comparisons. You can query embedded objects for memberwise
equality on all primitive types. You cannot perform memberwise comparison 
on objects and collections.

Dynamic APIs
````````````

Because the schema has no concept of custom type mappings, reading data via
any of the dynamic APIs gives the underlying persisted type. Realm does 
support writing mapped types via a dynamic API, and converts the projected
type to the persisted type.

The most common use of the dynamic APIs is migration. You can write projected
types during migration, and Realm converts the projected type to the persisted
type. However, reading data during a migration gives the underlying persisted
type.

.. _ios-sort-query-results:

Sort Query Results
------------------

A sort operation allows you to configure the order in which Realm
Database returns queried objects. You can sort based on one or more
properties of the objects in the results collection. Realm Database only
guarantees a consistent order of results if you explicitly sort them.

.. tabs-realm-languages::
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      To sort, call :swift-sdk:`Results.sorted(byKeyPath:ascending:)
      <Structs/Results.html#/s:10RealmSwift7ResultsV6sorted9byKeyPath9ascendingACyxGSS_SbtF>`
      with the desired key path to sort by.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadRealmObjects.snippet.sort.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      To sort, call :objc-sdk:`-[RLMResults
      sortedResultsUsingKeyPath:ascending:]
      <Classes/RLMResults.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMResults(im)sortedResultsUsingKeyPath:ascending:>`
      with the desired key path to sort by.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadWriteData.snippet.sort.m
         :language: objectivec

.. tip:: Sort on Related and Embedded Object Properties

   To sort a query based on a property of an :ref:`embedded object
   <ios-define-an-embedded-object-property>` or a :ref:`related object
   <ios-declare-relationship-properties>`, use dot-notation as if it
   were in a regular, nested object.

.. include:: /includes/string-sort-and-query-limitations-note.rst

.. _ios-aggregate-data:

Aggregate Data
--------------

You can use Realm's aggregation operators for sophisticated queries
against list properties.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadWriteData.snippet.aggregate.m
         :language: objectivec

.. _ios-chain-queries:

Chain Queries
-------------

Because :ref:`results are lazily evaluated <ios-results-are-lazy>`, you
can chain several queries together. Unlike traditional databases, this
does not require a separate trip to the database for each successive
query.

.. example::

   To get a result set for tan dogs, and tan dogs whose names start with
   'B', chain two queries like this:

         .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadWriteData.snippet.chain-query.m
            :language: objectivec

Query Class Projections
-----------------------

To query for :ref:`class projections <ios-define-a-class-projection>` in a 
realm, pass the metatype instance ``YourProjectionName.self`` to 
:swift-sdk:`Realm.objects(_:)
<Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V7objectsyAA7ResultsVyxGxmSo0aB6ObjectCRbzlF>`.
This returns a :swift-sdk:`Results <Structs/Results.html>` object
representing all of the class projection objects in the realm.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ClassProjection.snippet.retrieve-data-through-class-projection.swift
   :language: swift

.. tip::

   Don't do derived queries on top of class projection results. Instead, run a 
   query against the Realm object directly and then project the result. If you 
   try to do a derived query on top of class projection results, querying a 
   field with the same name and type as the original object works, but querying 
   a field with a name or type that isn't in the original object fails.

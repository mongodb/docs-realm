Delete Realm Objects
--------------------

Deleting Realm Objects must occur within write transactions. For
more information about write trasactions, see: :ref:`Key Concept: 
Transactions <ios-write-transactions>`.

If you want to delete the Realm file itself, see: :ref:`Delete a Realm 
<swift-delete-a-realm>`.

.. important:: Do not use objects after delete

   You cannot access or modify an object after you have deleted it from
   a realm. If you try to use a deleted object, Realm Database throws an
   error.

Delete All Objects of a Specific Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs-realm-languages::
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      To delete all objects of a given object type from a realm, pass
      the result of :swift-sdk:`Realm.objects(_:)
      <Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V7objectsyAA7ResultsVyxGxmSo0aB6ObjectCRbzlF>`
      for the type you wish to delete to :swift-sdk:`Realm.delete(_:)
      <Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V6deleteyyxSTRzSo13RLMObjectBaseC7ElementRczlF>`
      inside of a write transaction.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/DeleteRealmObjects.snippet.delete-all-of-class.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      To delete all objects of a given object type from a realm, pass
      the result of :objc-sdk:`+[YourRealmObjectClass
      allObjectsInRealm:]
      <Classes/RLMObject.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMObject(cm)allObjectsInRealm:>`
      to :objc-sdk:`-[Realm deleteObjects:]
      <Classes/RLMRealm.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMRealm(im)deleteObjects:>`
      inside of a write transaction. Replace ``YourRealmObjectClass``
      with your Realm object class name.

Delete All Objects in a Realm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs-realm-languages::
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      To delete all objects from the realm, call
      :swift-sdk:`Realm.deleteAll()
      <Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V9deleteAllyyF>` inside of a
      write transaction. This clears the realm of all object instances
      but does not affect the realm's schema.

         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      deleteAllObjects]
      <Classes/RLMRealm.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMRealm(im)deleteAllObjects>`
      inside of a write transaction. This clears the realm of all object
      instances but does not affect the realm's schema.

.. _swift-delete-map:

Delete Map Keys/Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can delete :swift-sdk:`map <Classes/Map.html>` entries in a few ways:

- Use ``removeObject(for:)`` to remove the key and the value
- If the dictionary's value is optional, you can set the value of the key to 
  ``nil`` to keep the key.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/DeleteRealmObjects.snippet.map.swift
   :language: swift

.. _swift-delete-mutableset-elements:

Delete MutableSet Elements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can delete specific elements from a :swift-sdk:`MutableSet 
<Classes/MutableSet.html>`, or clear all of the elements from the set.
If you are working with multiple sets, you can also remove elements in one
set from the other set; see: :ref:`swift-update-mutableset-property`.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/DeleteRealmObjects.snippet.set-collections.swift

Key Concept: Transactions
-------------------------

Write Transactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Realm Database uses a highly efficient storage engine
to persist objects. You can **create** objects in a realm,
**update** objects in a realm, and eventually **delete**
objects from a realm. Because these operations modify the
state of the realm, we call them writes.

Realm handles writes in terms of **transactions**. A
transaction is a list of read and write operations that
Realm treats as a single indivisible operation. In other
words, a transaction is *all or nothing*: either all of the
operations in the transaction succeed or none of the
operations in the transaction take effect. 

All writes must happen in a transaction.

A realm allows only one open transaction at a time. Realm
blocks other writes on other threads until the open
transaction is complete. Consequently, there is no race
condition when reading values from the realm within a
transaction.

When you are done with your transaction, Realm either
**commits** it or **cancels** it:

- When Realm **commits** a transaction, Realm writes
  all changes to disk. For synced realms, the SDK queues the change
  for synchronization with App Services.
- When Realm **cancels** a write transaction or an operation in
  the transaction causes an error, all changes are discarded
  (or "rolled back").

.. _ios-open-a-transaction:

Run a Transaction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Swift SDK represents each transaction as a callback function
that contains zero or more read and write operations. To run
a transaction, define a transaction callback and pass it to
the realm's ``write`` method. Within this callback, you are
free to create, read, update, and delete on the realm. If
the code in the callback throws an exception when Realm runs
it, Realm cancels the transaction. Otherwise, Realm commits
the transaction immediately after the callback.

.. important:: Concurrency Concerns

   Since transactions block each other, it is best to avoid
   opening transactions on both the UI thread and a
   background thread. If you are using :ref:`Sync
   <sync>`, avoid opening transactions on the
   UI thread altogether, as Realm processes synchronizations
   on a background thread. If a background transaction
   blocks your UI thread's transaction, your app may appear
   unresponsive.

.. example::

   The following code shows how to run a transaction with
   the realm's write method. If the code in the callback
   throws an exception, Realm cancels the transaction.
   Otherwise, Realm commits the transaction.

.. _ios-interface-driven-writes:
.. _ios-silent-writes:

Key Concept: Interface-Driven Writes
------------------------------------

Realm always delivers notifications asynchronously, so they
never block the UI thread. However, there are situations when the UI
must reflect changes instantly. If you update the UI directly at the
same time as the write, the eventual notification could double that
update. This could lead to your app crashing due to inconsistent state
between the UI and the backing data store. To avoid this, you can write
without sending a notification to a specific handler. We call this type
of transaction an **interface-driven write**.

.. example::

   Say we decide to manage a table view's data source manually, because
   our app design requires an instantaneous response to UI-driven table
   updates. As soon as a user adds an item to the table view, we insert
   it to our data source, which writes to the realm but also
   immediately kicks off the animation. However, when Realm
   delivers the change notification for this insertion a little later,
   it indicates that an object has been added. But we already updated
   the table view for it! Rather than writing complicated code to handle
   this case, we can use interface-driven writes to prevent a specific
   notification handler from firing for that specific write.

Interface-driven writes, also known as silent writes, are especially
useful when using fine-grained collection notifications with a
:ref:`synchronized realm <sync>` realm. While you use
interface-driven writes for the current user's updates and update the UI
immediately, the sync process can use standard notifications to update
the UI.

.. _ios-create-a-new-object:

Create an Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs-realm-languages::
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      To add an object to a realm, instantiate it as you would any other
      object and then pass it to :swift-sdk:`Realm.add(_:update:)
      <Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V3add_6updateySo0aB6ObjectC_AC12UpdatePolicyOtF>`
      inside of a write transaction.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/CreateRealmObjects.snippet.create.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      To add an object to a realm, instantiate it as you would any other
      object and then pass it to :objc-sdk:`-[RLMRealm addObject:]
      <Classes/RLMRealm.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMRealm(im)addObject:>` inside
      of a write transaction.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadWriteData.snippet.create.m
         :language: objectivec

.. _ios-initialize-an-object-with-a-value:

Initialize Objects with a Value
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can initialize an object by passing an initializer value to
:swift-sdk:`Object.init(value:)
<Extensions/Object.html#/s:So16RealmSwiftObjectC0aB0E5valueAByp_tcfc>`.
The initializer value can be a :apple:`key-value coding
<library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueCoding/>`
compliant object, a dictionary, or an array containing one element for
each managed property.

.. note::

   When using an array as an initializer value, you must include all
   properties in the same order as they are defined in the model.

You can even initialize :ref:`related <ios-client-relationships>` or
:ref:`embedded objects <ios-embedded-objects>` by nesting initializer
values:

Some Property Types are Only Mutable in a Write Transaction
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Some property types are only mutable in a write transaction. For example, 
you can instantiate an object with a :ref:`MutableSet <ios-mutableset-data-type>` 
property, but you can only set that property's value in a write transaction. 
You cannot initialize the object with a value for that property unless 
you do so inside a write transaction.

.. _ios-create-an-object-with-json:

Create an Object with JSON
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Realm does not directly support JSON, but you can use
:apple:`JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with:options:)
<documentation/foundation/jsonserialization/1415493-jsonobject>` to
convert JSON into a value that you can pass to
:swift-sdk:`Realm.create(_:value:update:)
<Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V6create_5value6updatexxm_ypAC12UpdatePolicyOtSo0aB6ObjectCRbzlF>`.

.. tabs-realm-languages::
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/CreateRealmObjects.snippet.json.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadWriteData.snippet.json.m
         :language: objectivec

Nested objects or arrays in the JSON map to :ref:`to-one
<ios-to-one-relationship>` or :ref:`to-many relationships
<ios-to-one-relationship>`. 

The JSON property names and types must match the destination
:ref:`object schema <ios-object-schemas>` exactly. For example:

- ``float`` properties must be initialized with float-backed ``NSNumbers``.
- ``Date`` and ``Data`` properties cannot be inferred from strings. Convert them to the appropriate type before passing to :swift-sdk:`Realm.create(_:value:update:) <Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V6create_5value6updatexxm_ypAC12UpdatePolicyOtSo0aB6ObjectCRbzlF>`.
- Required properties cannot be ``null`` or missing in the JSON.

Realm ignores any properties in the JSON not defined in the
object schema.

.. tip::

   If your JSON schema doesn't exactly align with your Realm objects,
   consider using a third-party framework to transform your JSON. There
   are many model mapping frameworks that work with Realm.
   See a :github:`partial list in the realm-swift repository
   <realm/realm-swift/issues/694#issuecomment-144785299>`.

.. _swift-create-embedded-object:

Create an Embedded Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create an embedded object, assign an instance of the embedded object
to a parent object's property:

.. tabs-realm-languages::
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/CreateRealmObjects.snippet.create-an-embedded-object.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/EmbeddedObjects/CreateEmbeddedObject.m
         :language: objectivec

.. _swift-create-object-map-property:

Create an Object with a Map Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you create an object that has a :swift-sdk:`map property 
<Classes/Map.html>`, you can set the values for keys in a few ways: 

- Set keys and values on the object and then add the object to the realm
- Set the object's keys and values directly inside a write transaction
- Use key-value coding to set or update keys and values inside a write transaction

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/CreateRealmObjects.snippet.map.swift
   :language: swift

.. _swift-create-object-mutableset-property:

Create an Object with a MutableSet Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can create objects that contain :swift-sdk:`MutableSet 
<Classes/MutableSet.html>` properties as you would any Realm object, but you
can only mutate a MutableSet within a write transaction. This means you can
only set the value(s) of a mutable set property within a write transaction.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/CreateRealmObjects.snippet.set-collections.swift
   :language: swift

.. _swift-create-object-anyrealvalue-property:

Create an Object with an AnyRealmValue Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you create an object with an :ref:`AnyRealmValue property 
<ios-mixed-data-type>`, you must specify the type of the value you store in 
the property. The Realm Swift SDK provides an :swift-sdk:`AnyRealmValue enum 
<Enums/AnyRealmValue.html>` that iterates through all of the types the 
AnyRealmValue can store.

Later, when you :ref:`read an AnyRealmValue <swift-read-anyrealmvalue-property>`, 
you must check the type before you do anything with the value.

.. _ios-copy-an-object-to-another-realm:

Copy an Object to Another Realm
-------------------------------

.. tabs-realm-languages::
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      To copy an object from one realm to another, pass the original
      object to :swift-sdk:`Realm.create(_:value:update:):
      <Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V6create_5value6updatexxm_ypAC12UpdatePolicyOtSo0aB6ObjectCRbzlF>`:

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/CreateRealmObjects.snippet.copy-to-another-realm.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      To copy an object from one realm to another, pass the original
      object to :objc-sdk:`+[RLMObject createInRealm:withValue:]
      <Classes/RLMObject.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMObject(cm)createInRealm:withValue:>`:

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ReadWriteData.snippet.copy-to-another-realm.m
         :language: objectivec

.. important::

   The ``create`` methods do not support handling cyclical object
   graphs. Do not pass in an object containing relationships involving
   objects that refer back to their parents, either directly or
   indirectly.

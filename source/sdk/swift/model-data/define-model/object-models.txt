Key Concept: Object Types & Schemas
-----------------------------------

Realm Database applications model data as objects composed of
field-value pairs that each contain one or more :ref:`supported
<ios-supported-property-types>` data types.

Realm objects are regular Swift or Objective-C classes, but
they also bring a few additional features like :ref:`live queries
<ios-live-queries>`. The Swift SDK memory maps Realm objects directly to
native Swift or Objective-C objects, which means there's no need to use
a special data access library, such as an :wikipedia:`ORM
<Object-relational_mapping>`. Instead, you can work with Realm objects
as you would any other class instance.

Every Realm object conforms to a specific **object type**, which is
essentially a class that defines the :ref:`properties <ios-client-properties>` 
and :ref:`relationships <ios-client-relationships>` for objects of that type. 
Realm guarantees that all objects in a realm conform to 
the schema for their object type and validates objects whenever they're 
created, modified, or deleted.

.. example::
   
   The following schema defines a ``Dog`` object type with a string name,
   optional string breed, date of birth, and primary key ID.

            :language: objectivec

.. _ios-realm-schema:

Realm Schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **realm schema** is a list of valid :ref:`object schemas
<ios-object-schemas>` that a realm may contain. Every Realm object must
conform to an object type that's included in its realm's schema.

By default, the Swift SDK automatically adds all classes in your project
that derive from :objc-sdk:`RLMObject <Classes/RLMObject.html>` or
:objc-sdk:`RLMEmbeddedObject <Classes/RLMEmbeddedObject.html>` to the
realm schema.

.. tip:: Configure Your Realm Schema
   
   To control which classes Realm adds to a realm schema, see
   :ref:`ios-provide-a-subset-of-classes-to-a-realm`.

If a realm already contains data when you open it,
Realm Database validates each object to ensure that an object
schema was provided for its type and that it meets all of the
constraints specified in the schema.

.. tip:: Learn How to Work With a Realm
   
   For code examples that show how to configure and open a realm in the
   Swift SDK, see :ref:`ios-configure-and-open-a-realm`.

.. _ios-inheritance:

Model Inheritance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can subclass Realm Database models to share behavior between
classes, but there are limitations. In particular, Realm
does not allow you to:

- Cast between polymorphic classes: subclass to subclass, subclass to parent, parent to subclass
- Query on multiple classes simultaneously: for example, "get all instances of parent class and subclass"
- Multi-class containers: ``List`` and ``Results`` with a mixture of parent and subclass

.. tip::

   Check out the :github:`code samples
   <realm/realm-swift/issues/1109#issuecomment-143834756>` for working
   around these limitations.

.. versionadded:: 10.10.0
   While you can't mix ``@Persisted`` and ``@objc dynamic`` property declarations
   within a class, you can mix the notation styles across base and subclasses. 
   For example, a base class could have a ``@Persisted var foo: Int`` property, 
   and a subclass could have an ``@objc dynamic var bar = 0`` property, with 
   both persisted. However, the ``@objc dynamic`` property would be ignored if
   the ``@Persisted`` property were within the same base or subclass.

.. _ios-structs:

Swift Structs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Realm Database does not support Swift structs as models for a variety of 
reasons. Realm's design focuses on “live” objects. 
This concept is not compatible with value type structs. By design, 
Realm provides features that are incompatible with these 
semantics, such as:
 
- :ref:`Live data <ios-live-object>`
- :ref:`Reactive APIs <ios-react-to-changes>`
- Low memory footprint of data
- Good operation performance
- :ref:`Lazy and cheap access to partial data <ios-live-queries>`
- Lack of data serialization/deserialization
- :ref:`Keeping potentially complex object graphs synchronized <ios-sync-changes-between-devices>`

That said, it is sometimes useful to detach objects from their backing 
realm. This typically isn't an ideal design decision. Instead, 
developers use this as a workaround for temporary limitations in our 
library.

You can use key-value coding to initialize an unmanaged object as a copy of 
a managed object. Then, you can work with that unmanaged object
like any other :apple:`NSObject <documentation/objectivec/nsobject>`.

.. code-block:: swift

   let standaloneModelObject = MyModel(value: persistedModelObject)

.. _ios-client-properties:

Key Concept: Properties
-----------------------

Your Realm object model is a collection of properties. On the most basic level,
when you create your model, your declarations give Realm information about
each property:

- The data type and whether the property is optional or required
- Whether Realm should store or ignore the property
- Whether the property is a primary key or should be indexed

Properties are also the mechanism for establishing :ref:`relationships 
<swift-client-relationships>` between Realm object types.

.. _ios-build-view-models-with-realm:

Key Concept: View Models with Realm
-----------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 10.21.0

You can work with a subset of your Realm Database object's properties 
by creating a class projection. A class projection is a class that passes 
through or transforms some or all of your Realm Database object's 
properties. Class projection enables you to build view models that use an 
abstraction of your object model. This simplifies using and :ref:`testing 
<ios-simplify-testing-with-class-projections>` Realm Database objects 
in your application.

With class projection, you can use a subset of your object's properties 
directly in the UI or transform them. When you use a class projection for 
this, you get all the benefits of Realm Database's live objects:

- The class-projected object live updates
- You can observe it for changes
- You can apply changes directly to the properties in write transactions

.. _ios-define-a-new-object-type:

Define a New Object Type
------------------------

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      You can define a Realm object by deriving from the
      :swift-sdk:`Object <Extensions/Object.html>` or
      :swift-sdk:`EmbeddedObject <Extensions/EmbeddedObject.html>`
      class. The name of the class becomes the table name in the realm,
      and properties of the class persist in the database. This makes it
      as easy to work with persisted objects as it is to work with
      regular Swift objects.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ObjectModels.snippet.define-a-model.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      You can define a Realm object by deriving from the
      :objc-sdk:`RLMObject <Classes/RLMObject.html>` or
      :objc-sdk:`RLMEmbeddedObject
      <Classes/RLMEmbeddedObject.html>` class. The name of the
      class becomes the table name in the realm, and properties of the
      class persist in the database. This makes it as easy to work with
      persisted objects as it is to work with regular Objective-C
      objects.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ObjectModels.snippet.define-a-model.m
         :language: objectivec

.. note::

   Class names are limited to a maximum of 57 UTF-8 characters.

.. _ios-declare-a-property:

Declare Properties
------------------

When you declare the property attributes of a class, you can specify whether
or not those properties should be managed by the realm. **Managed properties** 
are stored or updated in the database. **Ignored properties** are not
stored to the database. You can mix managed and ignored properties 
within a class. 

The syntax to mark properties as managed or ignored varies depending on which
version of the SDK you use.

.. _persisted-property-attributes:

Persisted Property Attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 10.10.0
   The ``@Persisted`` declaration style replaces the ``@objc dynamic``, 
   ``RealmOptional``, and ``RealmProperty`` declaration notations from older 
   versions of the SDK. For an older version of the SDK, see: 
   :ref:`Objective-C Dynamic Property Attributes <objc-dynamic-property-attributes>`.

Declare model properties that you want to store to the database as 
``@Persisted``. This enables them to access the underlying database data.

When you declare any properties as ``@Persisted`` within a class, the other 
properties within that class are automatically ignored.

If you mix ``@Persisted`` and ``@objc dynamic`` property declarations within
a class definition, any property attributes marked as ``@objc dynamic`` will 
be ignored.

.. seealso::

   Our :ref:`Supported Property Types <ios-supported-property-types>` 
   page contains a property declaration cheatsheet.

.. _objc-dynamic-property-attributes:

Objective-C Dynamic Property Attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. versionchanged:: 10.10.0
   This property declaration information is for versions of the SDK before 
   10.10.0. 

Declare dynamic Realm model properties in the Objective-C runtime. This
enables them to access the underlying database data. 

You can either:

- Use ``@objc dynamic var`` to declare individual properties
- Use ``@objcMembers`` to declare a class. Then, declare individual 
  properties with ``dynamic var``. 

Use ``let`` to declare ``LinkingObjects``, ``List``, ``RealmOptional`` and 
``RealmProperty``. The Objective-C runtime cannot represent these 
generic properties.

.. versionchanged:: 10.8.0
   ``RealmProperty`` replaces ``RealmOptional``

.. seealso::

   Our :ref:`Supported Property Types <ios-supported-property-types>` 
   page contains a property declaration cheatsheet.

.. tip::

   For reference on which types Realm Database supports for use as
   properties, see :ref:`ios-supported-property-types`.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Swift
      :tabid: swift

      When declaring non-generic properties, use the ``@Persisted`` annotation. 
      The ``@Persisted`` attribute turns Realm model properties into accessors 
      for the underlying database data.

   .. tab:: Objective C
      :tabid: objective-c

      Declare properties on your object type as you would on a normal
      Objective-C interface.
      
      In order to use your interface in a Realm array, pass your
      interface name to the ``RLM_COLLECTION_TYPE()`` macro. You can put this
      at the bottom of your interface's header file. The
      ``RLM_COLLECTION_TYPE()`` macro creates a protocol that allows you to
      tag :objc-sdk:`RLMArray <Classes/RLMArray.html>` with your type:

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ObjectModels.snippet.array-declaration.m
         :language: objectivec
   
   .. tab:: Swift pre-10.10.0
      :tabid: swift-pre-10.10.0

      When declaring non-generic properties, use the ``@objc dynamic
      var`` annotation. The ``@objc dynamic var`` attribute turns Realm
      model properties into accessors for the underlying database data.
      If the class is declared as ``@objcMembers`` (Swift 4 or later),
      you can declare properties as ``dynamic var`` without ``@objc``.

      To declare properties of generic types ``LinkingObjects``,
      ``List``, and ``RealmProperty``, use ``let``. Generic properties
      cannot be represented in the Objective‑C runtime, which
      Realm Database uses for dynamic dispatch of dynamic
      properties.

.. note::

   Property names are limited to a maximum of 63 UTF-8 characters.

.. _ios-specify-an-optional-required-property:

Specify an Optional/Required Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Swift
      :tabid: swift

      You can declare properties as optional or required (non-optional) using 
      standard Swift syntax.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ObjectModels.snippet.optional-required-properties.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab:: Objective C
      :tabid: objective-c

      To declare a given property as required, implement the
      :objc-sdk:`requiredProperties
      <Classes/RLMObject.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMObject(cm)requiredProperties>`
      method and return an array of required property names.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ObjectModels.snippet.optional-required-properties.m
         :language: objectivec
   
   .. tab:: Swift pre-10.10.0
      :tabid: swift-pre-10.10.0

      .. versionchanged:: 10.8.0
         ``RealmProperty`` replaces ``RealmOptional``

      You can declare ``String``, ``Date``, ``Data``, and
      :swift-sdk:`ObjectId <Classes/ObjectId.html>` properties as
      optional or required (non-optional) using standard Swift syntax.
      Declare optional numeric types using the :swift-sdk:`RealmProperty
      <Classes/RealmProperty.html>` 
      type.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ObjectModels.snippet.optional-required-properties-objc-dynamic.swift
         :language: swift

      RealmProperty supports ``Int``, ``Float``, ``Double``, ``Bool``,
      and all of the sized versions of ``Int`` (``Int8``, ``Int16``,
      ``Int32``, ``Int64``).

.. _ios-specify-a-primary-key:
.. _ios-primary-keys:
.. _swift-primary-keys:

Specify a Primary Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can designate a property as the **primary key** of your class.

Primary keys allow you to efficiently :ref:`find
<ios-find-a-specific-object-by-primary-key>`, update, and :ref:`upsert
<ios-upsert-an-object>` objects.

Primary keys are subject to the following limitations:

- You can define only one primary key per object model.

- Primary key values must be unique across all instances of an object
  in a realm. Realm Database throws an error if you try to
  insert a duplicate primary key value.

- Primary key values are immutable. To change the primary key value of
  an object, you must delete the original object and insert a new object
  with a different primary key value.

- :ref:`Embedded objects <ios-embedded-objects>` cannot define a
  primary key.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Swift
      :tabid: swift

      Declare the property with :swift-sdk:`primaryKey: true
      <Structs/Persisted.html#/s:10RealmSwift9PersistedVA2A11_PrimaryKey01_A5ValueRpzrlE07primaryE0ACyxGSb_tcfc>`
      on the ``@Persisted`` notation to set the model's primary key.

      Override :objc-sdk:`+[RLMObject primaryKey]
      <Classes/RLMObject.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMObject(cm)primaryKey>` to
      set the model's primary key.

         :language: swift

.. _ios-index-a-property:
.. _swift-index-a-property:

Index a Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can create an index on a given property of your model. Indexes speed
up queries using equality and IN operators. They make insert and update
operation speed slightly slower. Indexes take up more space in the realm
file. It's best to only add indexes when optimizing the read performance
for specific situations.

Realm supports indexing for string, integer, boolean, ``Date``, ``UUID``,
``ObjectId``, and ``AnyRealmValue`` properties.

.. versionadded:: 10.8.0
   ``UUID`` and ``AnyRealmValue`` types

      on the ``@Persisted`` notation.

.. _ios-ignore-a-property:

Ignore a Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ignored properties behave exactly like normal properties. They can't be
used in queries and won't trigger Realm notifications. You can still
observe them using :apple:`KVO

-------------------------

.. _ios-class-projection-object-model:

About These Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this section use a simple data set. The two Realm object 
types are ``Person`` and an embedded object ``Address``. A ``Person`` has 
a first and last name, an optional ``Address``, and a list of friends 
consisting of other ``Person`` objects. An ``Address`` has a city and country.

See the schema for these two classes, ``Person`` and ``Address``, below:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ClassProjection.snippet.models.swift
   :language: swift

.. _ios-define-a-class-projection:

How to Define a Class Projection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 10.21.0

Define a class projection by creating a class of type :swift-sdk:`Projection 
<Classes/Projection.html>`. Specify the :swift-sdk:`Object <Extensions/Object.html>` 
or :swift-sdk:`EmbeddedObject <Extensions/EmbeddedObject.html>` base whose
properties you want to use in the class projection. Use the ``@Projected`` 
property wrapper to declare a property that you want to project from a 
``@Persisted`` property on the base object.

.. note::

   When you use a :ref:`List <ios-list-collections>` or a :ref:`MutableSet 
   <ios-mutableset-data-type>` in a class projection, the type in the 
   class projection should be :swift-sdk:`ProjectedCollection <>`.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ClassProjection.snippet.declare-class-projection.swift
   :language: swift

When you define a class projection, you can transform the original ``@Persisted``
property in several ways:

- Passthrough: the property is the same name and type as the original object
- Rename: the property has the same type as the original object, but a 
  different name
- Keypath resolution: use keypath resolution to access properties of the
  original object, including embedded object properties 
- Collection mapping: Project :ref:`lists <ios-list-collections>` or 
  :ref:`mutable sets <ios-mutableset-data-type>` of ``Object`` s or 
  ``EmbeddedObject`` s as a collection of primitive values
- Exclusion: when you use a class projection, the underlying object's 
  properties that are not ``@Projected`` through the class projection are 
  excluded. This enables you to watch for changes to a class projection 
  and not see changes for properties that are not part of the class 
  projection.

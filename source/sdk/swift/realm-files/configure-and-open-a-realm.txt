A **{+realm+}** is the core data structure used to organize data in
{+client-database+}. A realm is a collection of the objects that you use 
in your application, called Realm objects, as well as additional metadata 
that describe the objects. To learn how to define a Realm object, see
:ref:`Define an Object Model <ios-define-a-realm-object-schema>`.

When you open a realm, you can pass a :swift-sdk:`Realm.Configuration 
<Structs/Realm/Configuration.html>` that specifies additional details 
about how to configure the realm file. This includes things like:

- Pass a fileURL or in-memory identifier to customize how the realm is stored on device
- Provide a logged-in user and Sync details to use Sync with the realm
- Specify the realm use only a subset of your app's classes
- Whether and when to compact a realm to reduce its file size
- Pass an encryption key to encrypt a realm
- Provide a schema version or migration block when making schema changes

.. _ios-realm-file:

Key Concept: Realm Files
------------------------

{+client-database+} stores a binary encoded version of every object and type in a
realm in a single ``.realm`` file. The file is located at :ref:`a specific 
path <find-the-default-realm-path>` that you can define when you open the realm.
You can open, view, and edit the contents of these files with 
:ref:`realm-studio`.

.. see:: Auxiliary Realm Files
   
   Realm Database creates additional files for each {+realm+}.
   To learn more about these files, see :ref:`Realm Database Internals
   <ios-realm-database>`. Deleting these files has important implications.
   For more information about deleting ``.realm`` or auxiliary files, see: 
   :ref:`Delete a Realm <swift-delete-a-realm>`

.. _ios-in-memory-realm:

In-Memory Realms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also open a realm entirely in memory, which does not create a ``.realm``
file or its associated auxiliary files. Instead the SDK stores objects in memory
while the {+realm+} is open and discards them immediately when all instances are
closed.

.. see:: Open an In-Memory Realm

   To open an in-memory realm, see :ref:`ios-open-an-in-memory-realm`.

.. _ios-default-realm:

Default Realm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Calling :swift-sdk:`Realm()<Structs/Realm.html>` or 
:objc-sdk:`RLMRealm<Classes/RLMRealm.html>` opens the default {+realm+}. 
This method returns a {+realm+} object that maps to a file named 
``default.realm``. You can find this file:

- iOS: in the Documents folder of your app
- macOS: in the Application Support folder of your app

.. see:: Open a Default Realm

   To open a default realm, see :ref:`ios-default-and-file-url-realm`.

.. _ios-synced-realm:

Synced Realms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure a realm to automatically synchronize data between many devices
that each have their own local copy of the data. Synced realms use a different
configuration than local-only realms and require an Atlas App Services 
backend to handle the synchronization process. 

Applications can always create, modify, and delete synced realm objects locally,
even when offline. Whenever a network connection is available, the Realm SDK
opens a connection to an application server and syncs changes to and from other
clients. The :ref:`Atlas Device Sync protocol <sync-protocol>` and server-side
operational transforms guarantee that all fully synced instances of a realm see
exactly the same data, even if some changes occurred offline and/or were
received out of order.

.. tip:: Learn How to Configure and Use Sync
   
   For more information on Device Sync, including directions on how to
   set up sync in an App Services app, see :ref:`ios-realm-sync`.
   
   For code examples that show details of working with synced realms
   in the client, see :ref:`ios-sync-changes-between-devices`.

Synced Realms vs. Non-Synced Realms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Synced {+realms+} differ from non-synced local {+client-database+} in a 
few ways:

- Synced {+realms+} attempt to sync changes with your backend Atlas App Services App,
  whereas non-synced {+realms+} do not.
- Synced {+realms+} can be accessed by authenticated users, while non-synced 
  {+realms+} have no concept of users or authentication.
- With synced {+realms+}, you can :ref:`specify the download behavior 
  <ios-specify-download-behavior>` to download updates before opening a 
  {+realm+}. However, requiring changes to download before opening the 
  realm requires the user to be online. Non-synced {+realms+} can always 
  be used offline.

You can copy data from a non-synced {+client-database+} to a synced {+realm+}, 
and vice versa, but you cannot sync a non-synced {+client-database+}.

.. _convert-realm-sync:

Convert Between Synced and Non-Synced Realms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Realm does not have a direct mechanism to add sync to a non-synced realm, 
or to permanently stop Sync for a synced realm. However, the Swift SDK does 
provide methods that enable you to copy a realm file for use with a different 
configuration. With these methods, you can easily duplicate a realm's data, 
which you can then open with a sync or non-sync configuration. This lets
you indirectly add Sync to a non-synced realm, or permanently stop a realm
from syncing. See:

- :ref:`<ios-open-non-synced-as-synced-realm>`
- :ref:`<ios-open-synced-realm-as-non-sync>`

.. _ios-open-a-local-realm:

Open a Realm Without Sync
-------------------------

You can open a non-synced local realm with several different configuration 
options:

- No configuration - i.e. default configuration
- Specify a file URL for the realm
- Open the realm only in memory, without saving a file to the file system
- Copy a synced realm to use without Sync

.. _ios-default-and-file-url-realm:

Open a Default Realm or Realm at a File URL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tabs-realm-languages::
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      You can open a realm with the :swift-sdk:`Realm() initializer
      <Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V13configuration5queueA2C13ConfigurationV_So012OS_dispatch_D0CSgtKcfc>`.
      If you omit the :swift-sdk:`Realm.Configuration
      <Structs/Realm/Configuration.html>` parameter, you will open the
      default realm.

      You can set the default realm configuration by assigning a new
      Realm.Configuration instance to the
      :swift-sdk:`Realm.Configuration.defaultConfiguration
      <Structs/Realm/Configuration.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V13ConfigurationV07defaultC0AEvpZ>`
      class property.

         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      You can open the default realm with :objc-sdk:`+[RLMRealm
      defaultRealm]
      <Classes/RLMRealm.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMRealm(cm)defaultRealm>`.
      
      You can also pass a :objc-sdk:`RLMRealmConfiguration
      <Classes/RLMRealmConfiguration.html>` object to
      :objc-sdk:`+[RLMRealm realmWithConfiguration:error:]
      <Classes/RLMRealm.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMRealm(cm)realmWithConfiguration:error:>`
      to open a realm at a specific file URL, in memory, or with
      :ref:`{+sync+} <sync>`.

      You can set the default realm configuration by passing a
      RLMRealmConfiguration instance to 
      :objc-sdk:`+[RLMRealmConfiguration setDefaultConfiguration:]
      <Classes/RLMRealmConfiguration.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMRealmConfiguration(cm)setDefaultConfiguration:>`.

         :language: objectivec

.. _ios-open-an-in-memory-realm:

Open an In-Memory Realm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can open a realm entirely in memory, which will not create a
``.realm`` file or its associated :ref:`auxiliary files
<ios-realm-file>`. Instead the SDK stores objects in memory while the
{+realm+} is open and discards them immediately when all instances are
closed.

.. tabs-realm-languages::
   
   .. tab::

      Set the :swift-sdk:`inMemoryIdentifier
      <Structs/Realm/Configuration.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V13ConfigurationV18inMemoryIdentifierSSSgvp>`
      property of the realm configuration. Note that this property
      cannot be combined with ``fileURL`` or ``syncConfiguration``.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/OpenCloseRealm.snippet.open-in-memory-realm.swift

      property of the realm configuration. Note that this property
      cannot be combined with ``fileURL`` or ``syncConfiguration``.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/OpenCloseRealm.snippet.open-in-memory-realm.m
         :language: objectivec

.. important::

   When all *in-memory* {+realm+} instances with a particular identifier
   go out of scope, {+client-database+} deletes **all data** in that
   {+realm+}. To avoid this, hold onto a strong reference to any
   in-memory {+realms+} during your app's lifetime. 

.. _ios-open-synced-realm-as-non-sync:

Open a Synced Realm as a Non-Synced Realm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 10.23.0

.. tip::

   You may temporarily pause a Sync session if you do not want to permanently
   change a synced realm to a non-synced realm. See: :ref:`Suspend or Resume 
   a Sync Session <ios-suspend-or-resume-a-sync-session>`.

If you want to permanently stop a realm from syncing to your Atlas App Services backend,
you can use the :swift-sdk:`writeCopy(configuration: ) 
<Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V9writeCopy13configurationyAC13ConfigurationV_tKF>` 
method to make a copy of a synced realm for use with a non-sync configuration.
The example below creates a copy of the realm file, with all of its existing 
data, at a file URL you specify. 

This process removes the ``realm_id`` in the local realm. You must :ref:`increment 
the schema version as if you had deleted a property <ios-delete-a-property>`.

After you copy the realm for use without Sync, you can open the copy as a 
non-synced realm. Any changes you make to the non-synced realm reflect 
only in the local realm file. No changes propogate to other devices or
the Atlas App Services backend.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ConvertSyncLocalRealms.snippet.convert-sync-to-local.swift
   :language: swift

.. _ios-login-and-open-realm:

Open a Synced Realm
-------------------

The typical flow for opening a synced {+realm+} involves:

1. :ref:`Authenticating the user <ios-authenticate-users>`.
#. Creating a sync configuration.
#. Opening the user's synced {+realm+} with the configuration.

At authentication, we cache user credentials in a ``sync_metadata.realm`` 
file on device.

When you open a synced {+realm+} after authenticating, you can bypass the 
login flow and go directly to opening the synced {+realm+}, using the same 
sync configuration you already created.

With cached credentials, you can:

- Open a synced {+realm+} immediately with the data that is on the device.
  You can use this method offline or online.
- Open a synced {+realm+} after downloading changes from your Atlas App Services {+app+}. 
  This requires the user to have an active internet connection.

.. _ios-partition-based-sync-open-realm:

Open a Synced Realm for Partition-Based Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Initialize a synced {+realm+} with a :swift-sdk:`sync configuration <Extensions/User.html#/s:So7RLMUserC10RealmSwiftE13configuration14partitionValueAC0B0V13ConfigurationVx_tAC4BSONRzlF>`.
This enables you to specify a partition value whose data should sync to the realm.

      :tabid: swift

      .. versionchanged:: 10.15.0

      .. seealso::
         
         The Realm Swift SDK supports async/await syntax for opening a realm. 
         For completion handler syntax, see:
         :ref:`ios-realm-open-legacy`. 

         .. include:: /includes/swift-async-await-support.rst

      Pass a logged-in user's :swift-sdk:`configuration <Structs/Realm/Configuration.html>` 
      object with the desired :ref:`partition value <partition-value>` to 
      :swift-sdk:`{+realm+} initializers 
      <Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V13configuration5queueA2C13ConfigurationV_So012OS_dispatch_D0CSgtKcfc>`.

      You can optionally :ref:`specify whether a {+realm+} should download 
      changes before opening <ios-specify-download-behavior>`. If you do not
      specify download behavior, this opens a {+realm+} with data that is on
      the device, and attempts to sync changes in the background.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Sync.snippet.open-synced-realm.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      The first time you log in and open a synced {+realm+}, you'll log in the
      user, and pass the user's :objc-sdk:`RLMSyncConfiguration 
      <Classes/RLMRealmConfiguration.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMRealmConfiguration(py)syncConfiguration>` 
      object with the desired :objc-sdk:`partitionValue 
      <Classes/RLMSyncConfiguration.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMSyncConfiguration(py)partitionValue>` 
      to :objc-sdk:`+[RLMRealm realmWithConfiguration:error:]
      <Classes/RLMRealm.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMRealm(cm)realmWithConfiguration:error:>`.

      This opens a synced {+realm+} on the device. The {+realm+} 
      attempts to sync with your {+app+} in the background to check for changes 
      on the server, or upload changes that the user has made.

.. _ios-flexible-sync-open-realm:

Open a Synced Realm for Flexible Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 10.22.0

When you use Flexible Sync, use the ``flexibleSyncConfiguration()``
to open a synced realm. 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/FlexibleSync.snippet.flex-sync-open-realm.swift
   :language: swift

.. important:: Flexible Sync Requires a Subscription

   You can't use a Flexible Sync realm until you add at least one subscription.
   To learn how to add subscriptions, see: :ref:`<ios-sync-add-subscription>`.
   
.. _ios-open-synced-realm-as-different-sync-user:

Open a Synced Realm as a Different Sync User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 10.23.0

If you want to open a synced realm as a different Sync user, you can use 
the :swift-sdk:`writeCopy(configuration: ) 
<Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V9writeCopy13configurationyAC13ConfigurationV_tKF>` 
method to make a copy of the synced realm for use with the new user's 
sync configuration. The example below creates a copy of the synced realm, 
with all of its existing data, that you can use with a different sync 
configuration.

After you copy the realm for the new Sync user's configuration, you can 
open the copy as a synced realm for that user. 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ConvertSyncLocalRealms.snippet.convert-sync-to-sync.swift
   :language: swift

.. _ios-open-non-synced-as-synced-realm:

Open Non-Synced Realm as a Synced Realm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 10.23.0

If you want a non-synced realm to start syncing with other devices and your 
Atlas App Services backend, you can use the :swift-sdk:`writeCopy(configuration: ) 
<Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V9writeCopy13configurationyAC13ConfigurationV_tKF>` 
method to make a copy of the non-synced realm for use with a sync configuration. 
The example below creates a copy of a non-synced realm file, with all of 
its existing data, that you can use with a sync configuration.

After you copy the realm for use with Sync, you can open the copy as a 
synced realm. Any changes you make to the synced realm will reflect 
in the synced realm file, and they will also propogate to other devices and
the Atlas App Services backend.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/ConvertSyncLocalRealms.snippet.convert-local-to-sync.swift
   :language: swift

.. _ios-specify-download-behavior:

Download Changes Before Open
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 10.15.0

When you open a synced {+realm+} with the Swift SDK, you can pass the 
``downloadBeforeOpen`` parameter to specify whether to download the 
changeset from your Atlas App Services {+app+} before opening the {+realm+}. 
This parameter accepts a case from the ``OpenBehavior`` enum:

- ``never``: Immediately open the {+realm+} on the device. Download changes 
  in the background when the user has internet, but don't block opening
  the {+realm+}.
- ``always``: Check for changes every time you open the {+realm+}.
  Requires the user to have an active internet connection.
- ``once``: Download data before opening a {+realm+} for the first time, but
  open it without downloading changes on subsequent opens. This lets you 
  populate a {+realm+} with initial data, but enables offline-first 
  functionality on subsequent opens.

.. include:: /examples/generated/code/start/Sync.snippet.specify-download-behavior.swift.rst

.. _ios-open-a-synced-realm-offline:

Open a Synced Realm Offline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/offline-login.rst

You can only open a synced realm offline if you do not require your client 
app to ``always`` :ref:`download changes before opening the realm 
<ios-specify-download-behavior>`.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Authenticate.snippet.offline-login.swift
   :language: swift

.. _ios-close-a-realm:

Close a Realm
-------------

There is no need to manually close a {+realm+} in Swift or Objective-C.
When a {+realm+} goes out of scope and is removed from memory due to
`ARC
<https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/AutomaticReferenceCounting.html>`__,
the {+realm+} is closed.

.. _ios-handle-errors:

Handle Errors When Accessing a Realm
------------------------------------

.. tabs-realm-languages::
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      To handle errors when accessing a {+realm+}, use Swift's built-in
      error handling mechanism:

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/OpenCloseRealm.snippet.handle-error.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      To handle errors when accessing a {+realm+}, provide an
      ``NSError`` pointer to the ``error`` parameter:

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/OpenCloseRealm.snippet.handle-error.m
         :language: objectivec

.. _ios-provide-a-subset-of-classes-to-a-realm:

Provide a Subset of Classes to a Realm
--------------------------------------

.. tip:: Operating with Low Memory Constraints
   
   Some applications, such as watchOS apps and iOS app extensions, have
   tight constraints on their memory footprints. To optimize your data
   model for low-memory environments, open the {+realm+} with a subset
   of classes.

.. tabs-realm-languages::
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      By default, the Swift SDK automatically adds all
      :swift-sdk:`Object<Extensions/Object.html>`- and
      :swift-sdk:`EmbeddedObject<Extensions/EmbeddedObject.html>`-derived
      classes in your executable to the realm schema. You can control
      which objects get added by setting the :swift-sdk:`objectTypes
      <Structs/Realm/Configuration.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V13ConfigurationV11objectTypesSaySo13RLMObjectBaseCmGSgvp>`
      property of the :swift-sdk:`Realm.Configuration
      <Structs/Realm/Configuration.html>` object.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/OpenCloseRealm.snippet.configure-object-types.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      By default, the Swift SDK automatically adds all
      :objc-sdk:`RLMObject<Classes/RLMObject.html>`- and
      :objc-sdk:`RLMEmbeddedObject<Classes/RLMEmbeddedObject.html>`-derived
      classes in your executable to the realm schema. You can control
      which objects get added by setting the :objc-sdk:`objectClasses
      <Classes/RLMRealmConfiguration.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMRealmConfiguration(py)objectClasses>`
      property of the :objc-sdk:`RLMRealmConfiguration
      <Classes/RLMRealmConfiguration.html>` object.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/OpenCloseRealm.snippet.configure-object-types.m
         :language: objectivec


.. _ios-realm-api-properties:

Initialize Properties Using Realm APIs
--------------------------------------

You might define properties whose values are initialized using
{+client-database+} APIs. For example:

.. code-block:: swift

   class SomeSwiftType {
       let persons = try! Realm().objects(Person.self)
       // ...
   }

If this initialization code runs before you set up your Realm
configurations, you might get unexpected behavior. For example, if you
set a :ref:`migration <ios-migrations>` block for the default {+realm+}
configuration in ``applicationDidFinishLaunching()``, but you create an
instance of ``SomeSwiftType`` before
``applicationDidFinishLaunching()``, you might be accessing your
{+realm+} before it has been correctly configured.

To avoid such issues, consider doing one of the following:

- Defer instantiation of any type that eagerly initializes properties using {+client-database+} APIs until after your app has completed setting up its {+realm+} configurations. 
- Define your properties using Swift's ``lazy`` keyword. This allows you to safely instantiate such types at any time during your application's lifecycle, as long as you do not attempt to access your ``lazy`` properties until after your app has set up its {+realm+} configurations.
- Only initialize your properties using Realm APIs that explicitly take in user-defined configurations. You can be sure that the configuration values you are using have been set up properly before they are used to open {+realms+}.

.. _use-realm-when-the-device-is-locked:

Use Realm When the Device Is Locked
-----------------------------------

By default, iOS 8 and above encrypts app files using
``NSFileProtection`` whenever the device is locked. If your app attempts
to access a {+realm+} while the device is locked, you might see the
following error:

.. code-block:: text

   open() failed: Operation not permitted

To handle this, downgrade the file protection of the folder containing
:ref:`the Realm files <ios-realm-file>`. A less strict protection level
like :apple:`NSFileProtectionCompleteUntilFirstUserAuthentication
<documentation/foundation/nsfileprotectioncompleteuntilfirstuserauthentication>`
allows file access even when the device is locked.

.. tip::

   If you reduce iOS file encryption, consider using Realm's
   :ref:`built-in encryption <ios-encrypt-a-realm>` to secure your data
   instead.

This example shows how to apply a less strict protection level to the
parent directory of the default {+realm+}.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Encrypt.snippet.background-app-refresh-encryption.swift
   :language: swift

{+service-short+} may create and delete auxiliary files at any time.
Instead of downgrading file protection on the files, apply it to the
parent folder. This way, the file protection applies to all relevant
files regardless of creation time.

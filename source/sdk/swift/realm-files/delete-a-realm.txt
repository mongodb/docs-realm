In some cases, you may want to completely delete a realm file from disk.

Realm avoids copying data into memory except when absolutely required.
As a result, all objects managed by a realm have references to the file
on disk. Before you can safely delete the file, you must ensure the
deallocation of these objects:

- All objects read from or added to the realm
- All List and Results objects
- All ThreadSafeReference objects
- The realm itself

.. warning:: Don't delete files while realms are open

   If you delete a realm file or any of its auxiliary files while one or
   more instances of the realm are open, you might corrupt the realm or
   disrupt :ref:`sync <sync>`.

Delete a Realm File
-------------------

In practice, there are two safe times to delete the realm file:

1. On application startup before ever opening the realm.
#. After only having opened the realm within an explicit ``autorelease`` pool, which ensures deallocation of all of objects within it.

      You can delete the ``.realm``, ``.note`` and ``.management`` files
      for a given configuration with the
      :swift-sdk:`Realm.deleteFiles(for:)
      <Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V11deleteFiles3forSbAC13ConfigurationV_tKFZ>`
      class method.

      class method.

Delete a Realm File During a Client Reset
-----------------------------------------

When you use Device Sync, you may encounter a **client reset error**. 
During a client reset, your app must delete the local copy of the realm 
and download an updated version from the App Services backend.

Because Synced realms are stored locally and can be used offline, deleting
a Synced realm could lose data. If the client has written to the realm and 
the realm has not uploaded those changes, the client loses that data when 
you delete the Synced realm. The realm may be unable to upload changes when 
the client doesn't have a network connection for a long period of time, or 
in the event of a Sync error that requires you to restart Sync.

For more details on how to handle this scenario, see :ref:`ios-client-reset`.

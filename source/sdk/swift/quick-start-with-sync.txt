Overview
--------

This page contains information to quickly get Realm Database and
Device Sync integrated into your app. Before you begin, ensure you have:

- :ref:`Created an App <create-a-realm-app>`
- :ref:`Enabled Partition-Based Sync <enable-pbs-sync>`
- :ref:`Installed the Swift SDK <ios-install>`

.. note::

   This Quick Start demonstrates Partition-Based Sync. For Flexible Sync, 
   see: :ref:`Quick Start with Partition-Based Sync <ios-client-quick-start-with-sync>`.

Import Realm
------------

Near the top of any Swift file that uses Realm, add the following import
statement:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/CompleteQuickStart.snippet.import-realm.swift
   :language: swift

Initialize the App
------------------

To use App Services features such as authentication and sync, you must
access your App Services App using your App ID. You can find your 
App ID in the App Services UI.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/CompleteQuickStart.snippet.initialize-app.swift
   :language: swift

Define Your Object Model
------------------------

If have not :ref:`enabled Device Sync <enable-pbs-sync>` or you enabled Sync with
Development Mode in the App Services UI, you can define your :ref:`object model
<ios-realm-objects>` directly in code.

.. include:: /includes/note-get-schema-ui-dev-mode-disabled.rst

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/CompleteQuickStart.snippet.model.swift
   :language: swift

Authenticate a User
-------------------

When you have enabled :ref:`anonymous authentication <anonymous-authentication>` in the
App Services UI, users can immediately log into your app without providing any identifying
information:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/CompleteQuickStart.snippet.authenticate-user.swift
   :language: swift

The Realm Swift SDK provides many additional ways to authenticate, register, and link users.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`ios-authenticate-users`

Open a Realm
------------

Once you have :ref:`enabled Device Sync <enable-pbs-sync>` and authenticated a user, 
you can open a :ref:`realm <ios-realms>` asynchronously by calling 
:swift-sdk:`asyncOpen <Structs/Realm.html#/s:10RealmSwift0A0V9asyncOpen13configuration13callbackQueue0F0AC05AsyncD4TaskVAC13ConfigurationV_So17OS_dispatch_queueCyACSg_s5Error_pSgtctFZ>`, 
passing in the user's  
:swift-sdk:`Configuration <Structs/Realm/Configuration.html>` object, which  
includes the partition name. The following code demonstrates this:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/CompleteQuickStart.snippet.open-realm.swift
   :language: swift

.. seealso::

   :ref:`Sync Data <ios-open-a-synced-realm>`

Create, Read, Update, and Delete Objects
----------------------------------------

Once you have opened a realm, you can modify it and its :ref:`objects <ios-realm-objects>` in a :ref:`write transaction <ios-write-transactions>` block.

To create a new Task, instantiate the Task class and add it to the realm in a write block:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/CompleteQuickStart.snippet.create-task.swift
   :language: swift

You can retrieve a live :ref:`collection <ios-client-collections>` of all tasks in the realm:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/CompleteQuickStart.snippet.get-all-tasks.swift
   :language: swift

You can also filter that collection using :ref:`where <ios-client-query-engine>`:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/CompleteQuickStart.snippet.filter.swift
   :language: swift

To modify a task, update its properties in a write transaction block:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/CompleteQuickStart.snippet.modify-write-block.swift
   :language: swift

Finally, you can delete a task:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/CompleteQuickStart.snippet.delete.swift
   :language: swift

Watch for Changes
-----------------

You can :ref:`watch a realm, collection, or object for changes
<ios-react-to-changes>` with the ``observe`` method.

.. include:: /includes/serverless-watch-note.rst

.. important::

   Be sure to retain the notification token returned by ``observe`` as long as you want to continue observing. When you are done observing, invalidate the token to free the resources.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/CompleteQuickStart.snippet.watch-for-changes.swift
   :language: swift

Later, when you're done observing, invalidate the token:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/CompleteQuickStart.snippet.invalidate-notification-token.swift
   :language: swift


Log Out
-------

Once logged in, you can log out:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/CompleteQuickStart.snippet.logout.swift
   :language: swift

Complete Example
----------------

Run the complete example by replacing the app ID with your App ID and
calling ``runExample()``.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/CompleteQuickStart.snippet.complete-quick-start.swift
   :language: swift

Output
~~~~~~
Running the above code should output something like the following:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/QuickStarts/CompleteSwiftOutput

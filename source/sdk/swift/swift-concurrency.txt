Swift's concurrency system provides built-in support for writing asynchronous 
and parallel code in a structured way. For a detailed overview of the 
Swift concurrency system, refer to the `Swift Programming Language Concurrency
topic <https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Concurrency.html>`__.

Realm Concurrency Caveats
-------------------------

As you implement concurrency features in your app, consider this caveat 
about Realm's threading model and Swift concurrency threading behaviors.

.. _swift-suspend-execution-with-await:

Suspending Execution with Await
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Anywhere you use the Swift keyword ``await`` marks a possible suspension 
point in the execution of your code. With Swift 5.7, once your code suspends, 
subsequent code might not execute on the same thread. This means that 
anywhere you use ``await`` in your code, the subsequent code could be 
executed on a different thread than the code that precedes or follows it. 

This is inherently incompatible with Realm's :ref:`live object paradigm 
<ios-live-object>`. Live objects, collections, and realm instances are
**thread-confined**: that is, they are only valid on the thread on which 
they were created. Practically speaking, this means you cannot pass live 
instances to other threads. However, Realm Database offers several 
mechanisms for :ref:`sharing objects across threads 
<ios-communication-across-threads>`. These mechanisms typically require 
your code to do some explicit handling to safely pass data across threads.

You can use some of these mechanisms, such as :ref:`frozen objects 
<ios-frozen-objects>` or the :ref:`@ThreadSafe property wrapper 
<ios-thread-safe-reference>`, to safely use Realm objects and instances 
across threads with the ``await`` keyword. You can also avoid 
threading-related issues by marking any asynchronous Realm code with 
``@MainActor`` to ensure your apps always execute this code on the main 
thread.

As a general rule, keep in mind that using Realm in an ``await`` context 
*without* incorporating threading protection may yield inconsistent behavior. 
Sometimes, the code may succeed. In other cases, it may throw an error 
related to writing on an incorrect thread.

Async/Await APIs
----------------

Many Realm Swift APIs that involve working with :ref:`an Atlas App 
Services app <ios-application-services>` or a :ref:`synchronized realm 
<ios-synced-realm>` are compatible with Swift's async/await syntax. For 
examples, check out:

- :ref:`Async/Await Login <ios-async-await-login>`
- :ref:`Manage Email/Password Users <ios-manage-email-password-users>`
- :ref:`Link User Identities - Async/Await <ios-link-user-identities>`
- :ref:`Open a Synced Realm <ios-flexible-sync-open-realm>`
- :ref:`Manage Flexible Sync Subscriptions <ios-flexible-sync>`
- :ref:`Async/Await Call a Serverless Function <ios-async-await-call-function>`
- :ref:`Async/Await Query MongoDB <ios-mongodb-async-await-query>`

Realm does not provide Swift async/await support for reading or writing objects.
However, the Realm Swift SDK does provide an API to safely perform background 
writes without requiring you to use threading protection. For more information, 
refer to **Perform Background Writes** below.

If you have specific feature requests related to Swift async/await APIs,
check out the `MongoDB Feedback Engine for Realm 
<https://feedback.mongodb.com/forums/923521-realm>`_. The Realm Swift SDK
team plans to continue to develop concurrency-related features based on 
community feedback and Swift concurrency evolution.

Perform Background Writes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A commonly-requested use case for asynchronous code is to perform write 
operations in the background without blocking the main thread. While the 
Realm Swift SDK does not currently support an async/await API for this, it 
does have an API specifically for performing background writes: ``writeAsync``.

This API allows you to add, update, or delete objects in the background 
without using frozen objects or passing a thread-safe reference. With this 
API, waiting to obtain the write lock and committing a transaction occur
in the background. The write block itself runs on the calling thread.
This provides thread-safety without requiring you to manually handle 
frozen objects or passing references across threads. 

However, while the write block itself is executed, this does block new 
transactions on the calling thread. This means that a large write using
the ``writeAsync`` API could block small, quick writes while it executes.

For more information, including a code example, refer to: :ref:`ios-async-write`.

Tasks and TaskGroups
--------------------

Swift concurrency provides APIs to manage :apple:`Tasks <documentation/swift/task>` 
and :apple:`TaskGroups <documentation/swift/taskgroup>`. The `Swift concurrency
documentation <https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Concurrency.html>`__ 
defines a task as a unit of work that can be run asynchronously as part of 
your program. Task allows you to specificially define a unit of asynchronous 
work. TaskGroup lets you define a collection of Tasks to execute as a unit 
under the parent TaskGroup. 

Tasks and TaskGroups provide the ability to yield the thread to other 
important work or to cancel a long-running task that could be blocking 
other operations. To get these benefits, you might be tempted to use Tasks
and TaskGroups to manage realm writes in the background.

However, the thread-confined constraints described in :ref:`Suspending 
Execution with Await <swift-suspend-execution-with-await>` above apply in
the Task context. If your Task contains ``await`` points, subsequent code 
might run or resume on a different thread and violate Realm's thread confinement.

You must annotate functions that you run in a Task context with ``@MainActor`` 
to ensure code that accesses Realm only runs on the main thread. This negates 
some of the benefits of using Tasks, and may mean this is not a good design 
choice for apps that use Realm unless you are using Tasks solely for 
networking activities like managing users.

Actor Isolation
---------------

Actor isolation provides the perception of confining Realm access to a 
dedicated actor, and therefore seems like a safe way to manage Realm 
access in an asynchronous context.

However, using Realm in a non-``@MainActor`` async function is currently 
not supported. 

In Swift 5.6, this would often work by coincidence. Execution after an 
``await`` would continue on whatever thread the awaited thing ran on. 
Using ``await Realm()`` in an async function would result in the code 
following that running on the main thread until your next call to an 
actor-isolated function. 

Swift 5.7 instead hops threads whenever changing actor isolation contexts. 
An unisolated async function always runs on a background thread instead.

If you have code which uses ``await Realm()`` and works in 5.6, marking 
the function as ``@MainActor`` will make it work with Swift 5.7. It will 
function how it did - unintentionally - in 5.6.

The Swift SDK team is working on improving support for actor isolation.
If you have specific feature requests related to actor isolation,
check the status of similar feature requests or leave feedback through the 
`MongoDB Feedback Engine for Realm 
<https://feedback.mongodb.com/forums/923521-realm>`_.

Errors Related to Concurrency Code
----------------------------------

Most often, the error you see related to accessing Realm through concurrency
code is ``Realm accessed from incorrect thread.`` This is due to the 
thread-isolation issues described on this page.

To avoid threading-related issues in code that uses Swift concurrency features:

- Do not change execution contexts when accessing a realm. If you open a realm 
  on the main thread to provide data for your UI, annotate subsequent functions
  where you access the realm asynchronously with ``@MainActor`` to ensure it
  always runs on the main thread. Remember that ``await`` marks a suspension 
  point that could change to a different thread.
- Use the ``writeAsync`` API to :ref:`perform a background write 
  <ios-async-write>`. This manages realm access in a thread-safe way without 
  requiring you to write specialized code to do it yourself. This is a special
  API that outsources aspects of the write process - where it is safe to do 
  so - to run in an async context. You do not use this method with Swift's 
  ``async/await`` syntax - use this method synchronously in your code.
- If you want to explicitly write concurrency code where accessing a realm 
  is done in a thread-safe way, you can explicitly :ref:`pass instances across 
  threads <ios-thread-safe-reference>` or use :ref:`frozen objects 
  <ios-frozen-objects>` where applicable to avoid threading-related crashes.
  This does require a good understanding of Realm's threading model, as well
  as being mindful of Swift concurrency threading behaviors.

This page describes how to define relationships between objects in your data 
model. To learn about SDK objects and how to define them, refer to 
:ref:`sdks-object-models`.

Atlas Device SDK uses explicit relationships between the types of
objects in an App. A relationship is an object property that references
another SDK object rather than one of the primitive data types. You
define relationships by setting the type of an object property to
another object type in the object model or object schema.

Relationships are direct references to other objects in a database, which
means that you don't need bridge tables or explicit joins to define a
relationship like you would in a relational database. Instead you can
access related objects by reading and writing to the property that
defines the relationship. The SDK executes read operations lazily as they
come in, so querying a relationship is just as performant as reading a regular
property.

Relationship Types
------------------

The SDK supports **to-one**, **to-many**, and **inverse**
relationships. The SDK also provides a special type of object, called an
:ref:`embedded object <sdks-embedded-object>`, that is conceptually 
similar to a relationship but provides additional constraints.

The SDK *does not* inherently limit object references from other 
objects within the same database. This means that SDK relationships are 
implicitly "many-to-one" or "many-to-many." The only way to restrict a 
relationship to "one to one/one to many" instead of "many to one/many 
to many" is to use an :ref:`embedded object <sdks-embedded-objects>`, 
which is a nested object with exactly one parent. 

.. _sdks-to-one-relationship:

To-One Relationship
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **to-one** relationship maps one property in an object model to a single
instance of another object type. For example, a dog might have a to-one
relationship with a favorite toy.

Setting a relationship field to null removes the connection between objects. 
The SDK does not delete the referenced object, though, unless it is 
:ref:`an embedded object <sdks-embedded-objects>`.

.. important:: To-one relationships must be optional

   When you declare a to-one relationship in your object model, it must
   be an optional property. If you try to make a to-one relationship
   required, the SDK throws an exception at runtime.

.. _sdks-to-many-relationship:

To-Many Relationship
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **to-many** relationship means that an object relates to more than one 
other object. In Atlas Device SDK, a to-many relationship is a list of 
references to other objects. For example, a person might have many dogs.

You can represent a to-many relationship between two SDK types as a list, map,
or a set. Lists, maps, and sets are mutable: within a write transaction, you
can add and remove elements to and from these collection types. Lists, maps,
and sets are not associated with a query and are declared as a property of the
object model.

.. _cpp-inverse-relationship:

Inverse Relationship
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Relationship definitions in Realm are unidirectional. An 
**inverse relationship** links an object back to an object
that refers to it.

An inverse relationship property is an automatic **backlink** relationship. 
The SDK automatically updates implicit relationships whenever an object is 
added or removed in the specified relationship. You cannot manually set the
value of an inverse relationship property.

Since relationships are many-to-one or many-to-many, following inverse
relationships can result in zero, one, or many objects.

.. note:: Inverse Relationships Not Present in Device Sync Schema

   If you are using Atlas Device Sync, inverse relationships are not present
   in the server-side Device Sync schema in your App Services App.
   Since you can't directly set the value of an inverse relationship,
   the relationship does not exist in Device Sync schema.

   For more information on the server-side Device Sync schema,
   refer to :ref:`Configure and Update Your Data Model <sync-schema-overview>`
   in the Atlas App Services documentation.

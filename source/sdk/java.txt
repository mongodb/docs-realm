Use the Realm Java SDK to develop Android apps in Java or Kotlin. To develop 
multiplatform apps using Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile, refer to the 
:ref:`Realm Kotlin SDK <kotlin-intro>`.

.. kicker:: What You Can Do

Develop Apps with Realm Database
--------------------------------

Use free open-source Realm Database as a local object store on a device.
Use Device Sync to keep data in sync with your MongoDB Atlas cluster and 
other clients.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Use Realm Database Locally
      :tabid: local-realm

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Install the Realm Java SDK

            Use the Gradle build system to
            :ref:`java-install` in your project.

         .. step:: Define an Object Schema

            Use Java or Kotlin to idiomatically :ref:`define an object schema 
            <java-define-a-realm-object-schema>`. 

         .. step:: Open a Realm

            Realm Database stores objects in realm files on your device, 
            or you can open an in-memory realm which does not create a file.
            :ref:`Configure and open a realm <java-open-close-realm>` 
            to get started reading and writing data.

         .. step:: Read and Write Data

            :ref:`Create <java-create-a-new-object>`, :ref:`read 
            <java-read-from-realm>`, :ref:`update <java-update>`, and 
            :ref:`delete <java-delete-an-object>` objects from the realm. 
            Use Android-native queries to :ref:`filter data 
            <java-client-query-engine>`. 

         .. step:: React to Changes

            Realm's live objects mean that your data is always up-to-date.
            You can :ref:`register a notification handler 
            <java-react-to-changes>` to watch for changes and perform some 
            logic, such as updating your UI.

   .. tab:: Sync Data Across Devices
      :tabid: device-sync

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Connect to an Atlas App Services App

            Configure :ref:`Device Sync in an App Services App 
            <realm-sync-get-started>`. Define data access rules. Use 
            Development Mode to infer your schema from your Java or 
            Kotlin data model.

            Then, :ref:`connect to the backend <java-init-appclient>` from
            your client.

         .. step:: Authenticate a User

            Use one of our authentication providers to :ref:`authenticate a 
            user <java-authenticate-users>`. App Services provides access
            to popular authentication providers, such as Apple, Google, or 
            Facebook. Use our built-in email/password provider to manage 
            users without a third-party, or use custom JWT authentication to 
            integrate with other authentication providers. Anonymous authentication
            provides access without requiring a login or persisting user data.

         .. step:: Open a Synced Realm

            Instead of opening a local realm, :ref:`configure and open a 
            synced Realm <java-synced-realms>`. 
            :ref:`Subscribe to a query <java-sync-subscribe-to-queryable-fields>` 
            to determine what data the synced realm can read and write.

         .. step:: Read and Write Synced Data

            The APIs to read and write data from a realm are the same 
            whether you're using a synced or local realm. Data that you 
            read and write is automatically kept in sync with your Atlas 
            cluster and other clients. Apps keep working offline and 
            deterministically sync changes whenever a network connection is 
            available.

   .. tab:: Build with Atlas App Services
      :tabid: app-services

      .. container::

         Call Serverless Functions
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

         You can :ref:`call serverless Functions <java-call-a-function>` 
         from your client application that run in an App Services backend.

         Query MongoDB Atlas
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

         You can :ref:`query data stored in MongoDB <java-mongodb-data-access>`
         directly from your client application code.

         Authenticate Users
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

         Authenticate users with built-in and third-party :ref:`authentication 
         providers <java-authenticate-users>`. Use the authenticated user to 
         access App Services.

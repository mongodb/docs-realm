Call the :flutter-sdk:`App.deleteUser() <realm/App/deleteUser.html>`
on a user object to delete the user's account from your App Services App.
This deletes the account from the App on the server in addition to clearing local data.

   :language: dart

The user must sign up for a new account to use your App in the future.
They can use the same credentials (depending on the authentication provider),
but will not have the same User ID as their deleted account.

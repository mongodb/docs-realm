Read a User's Metadata
----------------------

You can read the :ref:`user metadata <user-metadata>` of a
currently logged-in user through the :flutter-sdk:`User <realm/User-class.html>`
object. You cannot edit user metadata through a ``User`` object.

The ``profile`` property on the ``User`` object returns a
:flutter-sdk:`User.profile <realm/User/profile.html>` object
of a logged-in user. The following example shows how to get a user's email from
the metatdata:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/authenticate_users_test.snippet.user-metadata.dart
   :language: dart

User metadata options vary depending on which provider you're using and
:ref:`which metadata fields you enable <configure-user-metadata-on-the-backend>`.

.. warning:: User Metadata May Be Stale
   
   Atlas App Services fetches the most recent version of user metadata when a user
   logs in. If the user changes their email address or profile photo with a
   login provider, for example, those changes do not update in user metadata
   until the user logs in again. Because Realm caches credentials and enables you
   to bypass the login flow, user metadata may become stale unless you
   force the user to log in again.


.. _flutter-configure-user-metadata:

Update User Metadata
--------------------

User metadata is read-only data. You cannot update or edit it. If you want
to create editable user data, use :ref:`custom user data <flutter-custom-user-data>`
instead.

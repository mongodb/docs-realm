Retrieve the Access Token
-------------------------

Refresh the Access Token
------------------------

The access token expires 30 minutes after a user logs in. It does not refresh automatically.
You can refresh it with :flutter-sdk:`User.refreshCustomData() <realm/User/refreshCustomData.html>`.

TODO: simple example using .refreshCustomData()

You can also periodically refresh the access token to make sure it's always up to date
with `Timer.periodic() <https://api.dart.dev/be/180360/dart-async/Timer-class.html>`__
from the ``dart:async`` library. Wrap the call to ``User.refreshCustomData()``
with the timer's callback function.

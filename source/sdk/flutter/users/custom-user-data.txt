Custom User Data - Flutter SDK
==============================

You can store arbitrary custom data about your
users with Atlas App Services. For example,
you might store a user's preferred language, date of birth, or local
timezone. Before writing and reading this data, you must enable custom user data
in the backend. To learn more, see :ref:`Enable Custom User Data <custom-user-data>`.

.. important::

   Currently you can only **read** custom user data with the Flutter SDK.
   In a future update to the SDK, you will be able to write custom user data
   from the SDK as well.

   You can create, update, or delete custom user data using one of the other
   Realm SDKs, with Atlas Functions, or by directly querying Atlas.

Before You Begin
----------------

To use custom user data, you must first enable custom user data
in App Services:

#. :ref:`Create a App <create-a-realm-app>`.
#. :ref:`Enable custom user data <enable-custom-user-data-procedure>`.

.. TODO: add back into the docs when there's a way to use MongoDB data access
.. with custom user data
.. To **create, update, or delete** custom user data, you will need the following
.. information from your custom user data configuration:

.. - The custom user data cluster
.. - The custom user data database
.. - The custom user data collection in which custom
..   user data documents are stored
.. - The user ID field used to map custom user data documents
..   to users (via user ID)

.. You can find this information in the App Services UI. In the left sidebar, click
.. :guilabel:`App Users`,  and then select the :guilabel:`Custom User Data` tab.

.. _flutter-read-custom-user-data:

Read a User's Custom User Data
------------------------------

You retrieve custom user data in the  :flutter-sdk:`User.customData <realm/User/customData.html>`
property of a logged in user:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/authenticate_users_test.snippet.read-custom-user-data.dart
   :language: dart


App Services **does not dynamically update** the value of the
``User.customData``  immediately when underlying data changes. Instead, App Services
fetches the most recent version of custom user data whenever a user
refreshes their :ref:`access token <user-sessions>` or when you explicitly
call :flutter-sdk:`User.refreshCustomData() <realm/User/refreshCustomData.html>`,
which ensures your app has the latest custom user data.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/authenticate_users_test.snippet.refresh-custom-user-data.dart
   :language: dart

.. _flutter-write-custom-user-data:

Write Custom User Data with an Atlas Functions
----------------------------------------------

You can write to custom user data with an Atlas Function. Atlas Functions
are server-side JavaScript functions that are built into your backend App.
You can call an Atlas Function directly from the Realm Flutter SDK.

It is not possible to write to custom user data directly from the Realm Flutter SDK.

To learn more about Atlas Functions, refer to the following documentation:

- :ref:`Call an Atlas Function <flutter-call-function>`
- :ref:`Atlas Functions <functions>` in the App Services documentation.

There is no single pattern for adding custom user data from an Atlas Function.
You should write your Function or Functions to suite your application's use case.

In this example, the Atlas Function takes an object passed by the client add adds
it to the custom user data collection in Atlas. The Function creates
the custom user data if it doesn't already exist and replaces all data in it
if it does exist.

.. code-block:: js
   :caption: writeCustomUserData.js - Atlas Function running on server (JavaScript)

   exports = async function(newCustomUserData) {
   const userId = context.user.id;
   const customUserDataCollection = context.services.get("mongodb-atlas").db("myDatabase").collection("custom_user_data");

   // Remove `userId` from the custom user data object to update because
   // you know it will stay the same.
   delete newCustomUserData.userId;
   
   const filter = { userId };
   // Replace the existing custom user data document with the new one.
   const update = { $set: newCustomUserData }
   // Insert document if it doesn't already exist
   const options = { upsert: true };

   const res = await customUserDataCollection.updateOne(filter, update, options);
   return res;
   }

The Realm SDK code to call this Function:

.. code-block:: dart
   :caption: Realm Flutter SDK client code (Dart)

   final user = app.currentUser!;

   final functionResponse = await user.functions.call("updateCustomUserData", {
     userId: user.id,
     favoriteFood: "pizza",
     lastUpdated: DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch
   });


.. TODO: add back in once you can interact w MongoDB from Realm Flutter
.. .. _flutter-create-custom-user-data:

.. Create a User's Custom User Data Document
.. -----------------------------------------

.. To create custom user data for a user, create a MongoDB document in the
.. custom user data collection. The user ID field of the document must
.. contain the the user's user ID. The following example uses
.. :ref:`MongoDB Data Access <>` to insert a
.. document containing the user ID of the currently logged in user and several
.. custom properties into the custom user data collection:

.. CODE_BLOCK

.. .. _flutter-update-custom-user-data:

.. Update a User's Custom Data
.. ---------------------------

.. Updating custom user data uses the same code as writing. The following example
.. finds and updates the data by using the
.. :flutter-sdk:`FLUTTER_UpdateOneAsync() <>`
.. method, and then refreshes the data to ensure the latest changes are available:
.. CODE_BLOCK

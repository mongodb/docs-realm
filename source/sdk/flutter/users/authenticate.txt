Atlas App Services provides an API for authenticating users using any enabled
authentication provider. Instantiate a :flutter-sdk:`Credentials <realm/Credentials-class.html>`
object and pass it to :flutter-sdk:`App.logIn() <realm/App/logIn.html>`
to authenticate and create a :flutter-sdk:`User <realm/User-class.html>`
object for that user.
Each authentication provider corresponds to a static constructor method
used to instantiate ``Credentials`` objects for that authentication provider.

Before You Begin
----------------

#. :ref:`Create an Atlas App Services app <create-a-realm-app>`.
#. Enable and configure one or more App Services :ref:`authentication providers <authentication-providers>`.

.. _flutter-register:

Register a New User Account
---------------------------

Realm registers accounts differently depending on the authentication provider:

- You do not need to register anonymous users.
- To register an email/password user, refer to :ref:`Email/Password User
  Registration <flutter-manage-email-password-users-register>`.
- If you are using Google, Facebook, Apple, or Custom JWT authentication,
  registration is handled by these third-party services.

.. _flutter-login:

Log In
------

You can authenticate users with :flutter-sdk:`App.logIn() <realm/App/logIn.html>`.

If successful, ``app.logIn`` returns a ``User`` object.

.. _flutter-login-anonymous:

Anonymous User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`anonymous authentication provider <anonymous-authentication>`
enables users to log in to your application with short-term accounts
that store no persistent personal information. To log in with anonymous
authentication, create an anonymous credential by calling
:flutter-sdk:`Credentials.anonymous() <realm/Credentials/Credentials.anonymous.html>`
and then pass the generated credential to
``app.logIn``.

   :language: dart

.. _flutter-login-email-password:

Email/Password User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`Email/Password authentication provider <email-password-authentication>`
enables users to log in to your application with an email username and
a password. To log in with email/password authentication, create an
email/password credential by calling :flutter-sdk:`Credentials.emailPassword() <realm/Credentials/Credentials.emailPassword.html>`
with the user's email and password. Then pass the generated credential
to ``app.logIn``.

   To learn more about the complete flow of using App Services Email/Password
   authentication, refer to the :ref:`Email/Password Users documentation
   <flutter-manage-email-password-users>`.

.. _flutter-logout:

Log a User Out
--------------

You can log out any user, regardless of the authentication provider used
to log in, using :flutter-sdk:`User.logOut() <realm/User/logout.html>`. This method:

- Deletes locally stored user credentials from the device

- Immediately halts any synchronization to and from the user's realms

Because logging out halts synchronization, you should only log out after
all local Realm updates have uploaded to the server.

.. _flutter-retrieve-current-user:

Retrieve Current User
---------------------

Once you have an authenticated user, you can retrieve the User object with the
:flutter-sdk:`App.currentUser <realm/App/currentUser.html>`
property. The ``currentUser`` object is persisted in local storage, so even if
the app shuts down after the initial authentication, you do not need to call
``logIn`` again (unless the user logged out).

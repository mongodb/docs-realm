Prerequisites
-------------

- `Install Flutter in your development environment <https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install>`__.
  You must use Flutter version 2.8 or later and Dart version 2.15.0 or later. 

Installation
------------

Follow these steps to add the {+service-short+} Flutter SDK to
your Flutter project.

.. include:: /includes/steps/install-flutter.rst

Dart-Only Installation
----------------------

If you'd like to use the {+service-short+} Flutter SDK with an application that uses
Dart but not Flutter, there is a separate Dart SDK package that you must use with a 
slightly different installation process. The Dart SDK can be used for CLI applications 
or when running Dart in a server environment. 
The Dart-only package has the same usage 
as the Flutter package.

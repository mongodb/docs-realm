Dart Standalone Installation
----------------------------

To use Realm with Dart but not Flutter, there is a separate
Dart SDK package with its own installation process.
The Dart SDK can be used for CLI applications or when running Dart in a server environment.
The Dart standalone package ``realm_dart`` has the same usage as the Flutter package.

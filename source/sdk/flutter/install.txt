Prerequisites
-------------

- `Install Flutter in your development environment <https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install>`__.
  You must use Flutter version 3.0 or later and Dart version 2.17.0 or later.

.. warning:: Incompatible with Dart 2.17.3

   The Realm Flutter SDK and Realm Dart Standalone SDK are not compatible with
   Dart 2.17.3 due to an issue with the Dart virtual machine in this version.
   You may use any other Dart 2.17.x version with Realm.

.. _flutter-install-steps:

Installation
------------

Follow these steps to add the Realm Flutter SDK to
your Flutter project.

.. include:: /includes/note-use-realm-with-only-dart.rst

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Create a Flutter Project

      Create a Flutter project. Follow the instructions in the `Flutter documentation
      <https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/test-drive?tab=terminal>`__.

      .. code-block::

        flutter create <app_name>
        cd <app_name>

   .. step:: Add Realm to the Project

      To add the `Realm Flutter SDK <https://pub.dev/packages/realm>`__ to your project, run the command:

      .. code-block::

        flutter pub add realm

      This downloads the ``realm`` package and adds it to your project.
      In your ``pubspec.yaml`` file, you should see:

      .. code-block:: yaml
        :caption: pubspec.yaml

        dependencies:
          realm: <latest_version>


   .. step:: Import Realm Package

      To use the Realm Flutter SDK within your app, import the package
      into files where you will use it:

      .. code-block:: dart

        import 'package:realm/realm.dart';

.. _dart-install-steps:

Dart Standalone Installation
----------------------------

To use Realm with Dart but not Flutter, there is a separate
Dart SDK package with its own installation process.
The Dart SDK can be used for CLI applications or when running Dart in a server environment.
The Dart standalone package ``realm_dart`` has the same usage as the Flutter package
except where otherwise noted.

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Create a Dart Project

      Create a Dart project.

      .. note:: Using Dart without Flutter

        The official Dart docs have helpful getting started material
        for using Dart without Flutter for CLI and server use cases.

        `See the official documentation. <https://dart.dev/server>`_

   .. step:: Add Realm to the Project


      To add the `Realm Dart SDK <https://pub.dev/packages/realm_dart>`__ to your project, run the command:

      .. code-block::

        dart pub add realm_dart

      This downloads the ``realm_dart`` package and adds it to your project.
      In your ``pubspec.yaml`` file, you should see:

      .. code-block:: yaml
        :caption: pubspec.yaml

        dependencies:
          realm_dart: <latest_version>

   .. step:: Install Realm into Application

      Install the ``realm_dart`` package into the application.
      This downloads and copies the required native binaries to the app directory.

      .. code-block::

        dart run realm_dart install

   .. step:: Import Realm Package

      To use the Realm Dart SDK within your app, import the package
      into files where you will use it:

      .. code-block:: dart

        import 'package:realm_dart/realm.dart';

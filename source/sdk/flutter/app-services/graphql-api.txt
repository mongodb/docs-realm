   GraphQL is deprecated. :ref:`Learn More <migrate-hosting-graphql>`.

.. _flutter-graphql-setup:

The Atlas GraphQL API is deprecated. We do not recommend using the Atlas GraphQL
API. However, you can still query your data in MongoDB Atlas from your client app
using the Atlas GraphQL API and the Realm Flutter SDK.
And you can use any standard GraphQL client to query the Atlas GraphQL API.

Run queries and mutations with the Atlas GraphQL API from the client.

To learn more about available operations, refer to the following App Services documentation:

You can also find your entire schema and explore it with test operations in the

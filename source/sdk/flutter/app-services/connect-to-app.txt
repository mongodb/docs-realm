The ``App`` client is the interface to the Atlas App Services
backend. It provides access to the :ref:`authentication
<flutter-authenticate>` and Device Sync.

Before You Begin
----------------

#. :ref:`Create an App Services App <create-a-realm-app>`

.. _flutter-access-the-app-client:

Access the App Client
---------------------

#. :ref:`Find the App ID in the Realm UI <find-your-app-id>`.
#. Create an :flutter-sdk:`AppConfiguration <realm/AppConfiguration-class.html>`
   object with your App's App ID as the argument.
#. Create an :flutter-sdk:`App <realm/App-class.html>`
   with the ``AppConfiguration`` you just created. You use this
   ``App`` instance to access App Services features throughout your client application.

Advanced Configuration
----------------------

You can add optional arguments to the ``AppConfiguration`` for more granular control
of your ``App`` client. You may want to add things like custom timeouts
for connections or keys for local metadata encryption.
To learn about the available configuration options, refer to the
:flutter-sdk:`AppConfiguration <realm/AppConfiguration-class.html>` reference documentation.

.. note:: Connect Using Android 7 or Older

   The default HTTP client included with the Realm Flutter SDK does not work
   for apps running on Android 7 or older. To work around this, you must add
   a custom HTTP client to your ``AppConfiguration``. To learn more,
   refer to :ref:`Connect to App Services Using Android 7 or Older <flutter-connect-old-android>`.

The {+app+} client is the interface to the {+backend+}
backend. It provides access to the :ref:`authentication
<flutter-authenticate>` and {+sync+}.

Before You Begin
----------------

#. :ref:`Create a {+app+} <create-a-realm-app>`

.. _flutter-access-the-app-client:

Access the App Client
---------------------

#. :ref:`Find the App ID in the Realm UI <find-your-app-id>`.
#. Create an :flutter-sdk:`AppConfiguration <realm/AppConfiguration-class.html>`
   object with your {+app+}'s App ID as the argument.
#. Create an :flutter-sdk:`App <realm/App-class.html>`
   with the ``AppConfiguration`` you just created. You use this 
   ``App`` instance to access {+service+} features throughout your client application.

.. code-block:: dart

   final appConfig = AppConfiguration(APP_ID);
   final app = App(appConfig);


.. note::

   You can create multiple ``App`` instances to connect to multiple
   {+app+}s or to the same {+app+} with different configurations. All
   ``App`` instances that share the same App ID use the same underlying
   connection.

.. _flutter-app-client-configuration:

Advanced Configuration
----------------------

Add additional configuration for more granular control of the details of your app client,
such as custom timeouts for connections and keys for local encryption.
You can add optional arguments to the :flutter-sdk:`AppConfiguration <realm/AppConfiguration-class.html>`:

.. code-block:: dart

   final appConfig = AppConfiguration(APP_ID, 
     defaultRequestTimeout: const Duration(seconds: 120),
     localAppVersion: '2.0'
     // ... see reference docs for all available configuration options
   );

.. note:: 

   For most use cases, you only need your application's App ID to connect
   to {+service+}. The other settings demonstrated here are optional.

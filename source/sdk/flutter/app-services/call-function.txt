You can call an **Atlas Function** from a client application
using the Realm Flutter SDK.
Functions are serverless JavaScript functions that let you define and execute server-side logic.
These server-side functions can run in the context
of the authenticated user, and thus honor the rules, roles, and permissions that
you have assigned to your data in Atlas.

For more information on configuring and writing Atlas Functions, refer to
:ref:`Atlas Functions in the App Services documentation <functions>`.

Before You Begin
----------------

#. In an App Services App, :ref:`define an Atlas Function <define-a-function>`.
#. :ref:`Initialize the App client <flutter-connect-to-backend>`.
#. In your client project, :ref:`Authenticate a user <flutter-authenticate>`.

Call a Function
---------------

To call a Function, call  :flutter-sdk:`User.functions.call() <realm/FunctionsClient/call.html>`.
Pass the Function name as the first argument and all arguments for the Function
in a List as the second argument.

To include objects as arguments to the Function,
convert them to JSON first. You can do this using the `jsonEncode()
<https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-convert/jsonEncode.html>`__
function included in the built-in ``dart:convert`` library.

The Function returns a ``dynamic`` value containing :manual:`MongoDB Extended JSON (EJSON)
</reference/mongodb-extended-json/>` deserialized to a native Dart object.

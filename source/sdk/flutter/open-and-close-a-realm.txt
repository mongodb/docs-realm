.. _flutter-open-realm:

Open a Realm
------------

Use the :flutter-sdk:`Configuration <realm/Configuration-class.html>` class
to control the specifics of the {+realm+} you
would like to open, including schema.

Pass your configuration to the :flutter-sdk:`Realm constructor <realm/Realm-class.html>`
to generate an instance of that {+realm+}:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/open_realm_test.codeblock.open-realm.dart
   :language: dart

You can now use that {+realm+} instance to work with objects in the database.

.. _flutter-open-read-only-realm:

Open a Read-Only Realm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can open an existing Realm in read-only mode. To open a read-only realm, 
add ``readOnly: true`` to your ``Configuration`` object.


You can only open *existing* realms in read-only mode. 
If you try to write to a read-only realm, it throws an error. 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/open_realm_test.codeblock.read-only-realm.dart
   :language: dart

.. _flutter-open-in-memory-realm:

Open an In-Memory Realm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a realm that runs entirely in memory without being written to a file,
add ``inMemory: true`` to your ``Configuration`` object. 
In-memory realms **cannot** also be read-only.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/open_realm_test.codeblock.in-memory-realm.dart
   :language: dart

.. _flutter-set-custom-fifo:

Set Custom FIFO Special Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set a value for realm's `FIFO special files 
<https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.3.0?topic=csf-fifo-special-files>`_ location. 
Opening a realm creates a number of lightweight FIFO special files 
that coordinate access to the realm across threads and processes. 
If the realm file is in a location that doesn't allow for the creation of 
FIFO special files (e.g. FAT32 filesystems), then the realm cannot be opened.
In this case, realm needs a different location to store these files. 
Add ``fifoFilesFallbackPath: <Your Custom FIFO File Path>`` to your ``Configuration`` object.

This property is ignored if the directory for the realm database file allows
FIFO special files.

.. _flutter-close-realm: 

Close a Realm
-------------

Once you've finished working with a {+realm+}, close it to prevent memory leaks.  

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/open_realm_test.codeblock.close-realm.dart
   :language: dart

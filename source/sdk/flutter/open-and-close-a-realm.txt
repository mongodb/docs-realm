.. _flutter-open-realm:

Open a Realm
------------

Use the :flutter-sdk:`Configuration <realm/Configuration-class.html>` class
to control the specifics of the {+realm+} you
would like to open, including schema.

Pass your configuration to the :flutter-sdk:`Realm constructor <realm/Realm-class.html>`
to generate an instance of that {+realm+}:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/open_realm_test.codeblock.open-realm.dart
   :language: dart

You can now use that {+realm+} instance to work with objects in the database.

.. _flutter-close-realm: 

Close a Realm
-------------

Once you've finished working with a {+realm+}, close it to prevent memory leaks.  

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/open_realm_test.codeblock.close-realm.dart
   :language: dart

.. _flutter-read-data:

Read from Realm Database
------------------------

A read from a realm generally consists of the following
steps:

- Get all objects of a certain type from the realm.
- Optionally, :ref:`filter <flutter-filter-results>` the results
  using the :ref:`Realm Query Language <rql>`.
- Optionally, :ref:`sort <flutter-sort-results>` the results using Realm Query Language.

.. _flutter-query-objects:

Query All Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Retrieve a collection of all objects of a data model in the realm with the
:flutter-sdk:`Realm.all() <realm/Realm/all.html>` method.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.snippet.query-all-realm-objects.dart
   :language: dart

.. _flutter-query-list-realm-objects:

Query List of RealmObjects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can query any list of :flutter-sdk:`RealmObjects <realm/RealmObject-mixin.html>`.
For more information on querying, see :ref:`Filter Results <flutter-filter-results>`.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/read_write_data_test.snippet.query-realm-list.dart
   :language: dart

.. _flutter-filter-results:

Filter Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Filter a ``RealmList`` to retrieve a specific segment
of objects with the :flutter-sdk:`Realm.query() <realm/Realm/query.html>` method.
In the ``query()`` method's argument, use Realm Query Language to perform filtering.
Realm Query Language is a string-based query language that you can use to retrieve
objects from a realm.

For more information on constructing queries, refer to the
:ref:`Realm Query Language reference documentation <rql>`.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.snippet.query-realm-objects-with-filter.dart
   :language: dart

.. _flutter-sort-results:

Sort Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sort the results using the :ref:`Realm Query Language SORT() operator
<rql-sort-distinct-limit>` in the ``query()`` method's argument.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.snippet.query-realm-objects-with-sort.dart
   :language: dart

.. _flutter-write-operations:

Write Operations
----------------

Once you've opened a realm, you can create ``RealmObjects`` within it using a
:flutter-sdk:`Realm.write() transaction block <realm/Realm/write.html>`.
All operations within a write transaction are :wikipedia:`atomic <Atomicity_(database_systems)>`.
If an operation in the write transaction fails, the whole transaction fails,
Realm throws an error, and no changes from the transaction block are applied to the realm.

.. code-block:: dart

   realm.write((){
     // ...write data to realm
   });

You can also return values from the write transaction callback function.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/read_write_data_test.snippet.return-from-write.dart
   :language: dart

.. warning:: Write RealmObjects to One Realm

   You can only write ``RealmObjects`` to a single realm.
   If your app already writes a ``RealmObject`` to one realm,
   the SDK throws a ``RealmException`` if you try to add it.

.. _flutter-create-objects:

Create Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a new Realm object, instantiate an instance of the object class
and add it to the realm in a write transaction block with
:flutter-sdk:`Realm.add() <realm/Realm/add.html>`.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.snippet.create-realm-object.dart
   :language: dart

.. _flutter-create-multiple-objects:

Create Multiple Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add multiple objects to a realm, pass a list of multiple objects
to :flutter-sdk:`Realm.addAll() <realm/Realm/addAll.html>` inside a write transaction block.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.snippet.create-many-realm-objects.dart
   :language: dart

.. _flutter-update-objects:

Update Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _flutter-update-object-properties:

Update Object Properties
````````````````````````

To modify an object's properties, update the properties in a write transaction block.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.snippet.update-realm-object.dart
   :language: dart

.. _flutter-upsert-objects:

Upsert Objects
``````````````

To upsert an object, call :flutter-sdk:`Realm.add() <realm/Realm/add.html>`
with the optional ``update`` flag set to ``true`` inside a transaction block.
The operation either inserts a new object with the given primary key or
updates an existing object that already has that primary key.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/read_write_data_test.snippet.upsert.dart
   :language: dart
   :emphasize-lines: 11

.. _flutter-delete-objects:

Delete Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _flutter-delete-single-object:

Delete a Single Object
``````````````````````

Delete an object by calling the :flutter-sdk:`Realm.delete() <realm/Realm/delete.html>`
method in a write transaction block.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.snippet.delete-one-realm-object.dart
   :language: dart

.. _flutter-delete-multiple-objects:

Delete Multiple Objects
```````````````````````

Delete multiple objects with the :flutter-sdk:`Realm.deleteMany()
<realm/Realm/deleteMany.html>` method in a write transaction block.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.snippet.delete-many-realm-objects.dart
   :language: dart

.. _flutter-write-async:

Background Writes
-----------------

You can add, modify, or delete objects asynchronously using 
:flutter-sdk:`Realm.writeAsync() <realm/Realm/writeAsync.html>`. 

When you use ``Realm.writeAsync()`` to perform write operations, waiting 
to obtain the write lock and committing a transaction occur in the background. 
Only the write itself occurs on the main process. 

This can reduce time spent blocking the execution of the main process. This 
is particularly useful when using Device Sync, where you don't know when and
for how long the Sync client will be writing.

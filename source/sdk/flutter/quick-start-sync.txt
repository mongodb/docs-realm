This page contains information to quickly get Realm Database and
:ref:`Atlas Device Sync <sync>` integrated into your Flutter app.
Atlas Device Sync is an MongoDB Atlas App Service that synchronizes data between
a client application and a MongoDB database cluster on Atlas.

Flutter Template App
--------------------

The easiest way to get started with the Realm Flutter SDK is to use the
Realm Flutter template app. The template app comes with a Flutter client and
Atlas App Services backend configured to use Device Sync with the Flutter client.

The Realm Flutter template app is a todo tracker. Using Device Sync, the application
updates data with the server and other clients logged into the same account.

To use the Realm Flutter template app:

#. Follow the instruction to :ref:`create a new template app <create-template-app>`.
#. Create the Flutter template app by selecting: ``flutter.todo.flex``

The rest of this page looks at how you can add the Realm Flutter SDK to a Flutter
application uses examples from the template app.

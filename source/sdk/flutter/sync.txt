Realm Sync automatically synchronizes data between client applications and 
a :ref:`MongoDB Realm backend application <realm-cloud>`. When a client 
device is online, {+sync-short+} asynchronously synchronizes data in the 
background between the device and your backend {+app+}. 

The Flutter SDK only supports Flexible Sync. You must configure your backend {+app+}
to use :ref:`Flexible Sync <flexible-sync>`.  

.. note:: 

   The Flutter SDK does not support :ref:`Partition-Based Sync <partition-based-sync>`.

What is Flexible Sync?
----------------------

When you select :ref:`Flexible Sync <flexible-sync>` for your backend {+app+} 
configuration, your client implementation must include subscriptions to 
queries on :ref:`queryable fields <queryable-fields>`. Flexible Sync works 
by synchronizing data that matches query subscriptions you maintain in the 
client application. 

A subscription set contains a set of queries. Realm Flexible Sync returns 
documents matching those queries, where the user has the appropriate 
:ref:`permissions <flexible-sync-rules-and-permissions>` to read and/or 
read and write the documents. If documents match the query, but the client 
does not have the permission to read or write them, they do not sync to 
the client application.

You can form Flexible Sync queries using :ref:`Realm Query Language <realm-query-language>`.

Subscription sets are based on a specific type of :ref:`realm object
<flutter-define-realm-object-schema>`. 
To sync data for many types of realm objects, you must have multiple subscriptions.

To use Flexible Sync in your client application, open a synced realm 
with a flexible sync configuration. Then, manage subscriptions
to determine which documents to sync.

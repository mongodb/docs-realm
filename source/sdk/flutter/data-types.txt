The Flutter SDK currently only supports Dart-language data types. 
The Flutter SDK **does not** support MongoDB.BSON types or Realm-specific types
at the moment.


.. _flutter-dart-types:

Dart Types
----------

Realm supports the following Dart language data types:

- ``int``
- ``double``
- ``bool``
- ``String``
- ``List<T>``, where T is any of the supported data types or a 
  :flutter-sdk:`RealmModel <realm/RealmModel-class.html>`

.. _flutter-reference-realm-object:

Reference Realm Objects
-----------------------

You can also reference one or more Realm objects from another. Learn more in the 
:ref:`relationship properties documentation <flutter-client-relationships>`.

The Flutter SDK supports Dart-language data types, a limited subset of
`BSON <https://bsonspec.org/>`__ types, and :wikipedia:`UUID <Universally_unique_identifier>`.


.. _flutter-dart-types:

Dart Types
----------

Realm supports the following Dart types:

- ``int``
- ``double``
- ``bool``
- ``String``
- ``DateTime``
- ``List<T>``, where T is any of the supported data types or a
  `RealmModel <https://pub.dev/documentation/realm_common/latest/realm_common/RealmModel-class.html>`__.
  T can also be nullable (``List<T?>``).

DateTime
~~~~~~~~

When you use ``DateTime`` with the Realm Flutter SDK, you can declare 
it in the model as you would any other Dart type:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/data_types_test.snippet.datetime-model.dart
   :language: dart

However, it is important to note that Realm stores ``DateTime`` in UTC.
When you use ``DateTime``, you must create it in UTC or convert it 
with ``.toUtc()`` before you store it. If your application requires it, 
you can convert it back to local or the desired time zone when reading 
from Realm.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/data_types_test.snippet.datetime-use.dart
   :language: dart

.. _flutter-reference-realm-object:

Reference Realm Objects
-----------------------

You can also reference one or more Realm objects from another. Learn more in the
:ref:`relationship properties documentation <flutter-client-relationships>`.

.. _flutter-additional-types:

Additional Supported Data Types
-------------------------------

.. _flutter-objectid:

ObjectId
~~~~~~~~

ObjectId is a MongoDB-specific 12-byte unique value which you can use as an
identifier for objects. ObjectId is indexable and can be used as a primary key.

To define a property as an ObjectId, set its type as ``ObjectId`` in
your :ref:`object model <flutter-create-model>`.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/data_types_test.snippet.objectid-model.dart
   :language: dart

Call ``ObjectId()`` to set any unique identifier properties of
your object. Alternatively, pass a string
to ``ObjectId()`` to set the unique identifier property to a specific value.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/data_types_test.snippet.objectid-use.dart
   :language: dart

.. _flutter-uuid:

UUID
~~~~

UUID (Universal Unique Identifier) is a 16-byte :wikipedia:`unique value
<Universally_unique_identifier>`. You can use a UUID as an identifier for
objects. UUIDs are indexable and you can use them as primary keys.

.. include:: /includes/note-using-uuid-instead-of-objectid.rst

To define a property as a UUID, set its type as ``Uuid`` in
your :ref:`object model <flutter-create-model>`.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/data_types_test.snippet.uuid-model.dart
   :language: dart

To set any unique identifier properties of
your object to a random value, call one of the ``Uuid`` methods to create a UUID,
such as ``Uuid.v4()``.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/data_types_test.snippet.uuid-use.dart
   :language: dart

.. _flutter-realm-value:

RealmValue
~~~~~~~~~~

The `RealmValue <https://pub.dev/documentation/realm_common/latest/realm_common/RealmValue-class.html>`__
data type is a mixed data type that can represent any other valid Realm data type except a collection.
You can create collections  of type ``RealmValue``, but a ``RealmValue`` itself
cannot be a collection. ``RealmValue`` is also indexable.

.. note::

   When defining your Realm object schema, you cannot create a nullable ``RealmValue``.
   However, if you want a ``RealmValue`` property to contain a null value,
   you can use the special ``RealmValue.nullValue()`` property.

To define a property as ``RealmValue``, set its type in your Realm object model.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/data_types_test.snippet.realm-value-model.dart
   :language: dart

To add a ``RealmValue`` to a Realm object, call ``RealmValue.from()`` on the data.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/data_types_test.snippet.realm-value-from.dart
   :language: dart

Access the type of data with ``RealmValue.type`` and the value with ``RealmValue.value``.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/data_types_test.snippet.realm-value-type-value.dart
   :language: dart

.. _flutter-embedded-objects:

Embedded Objects
----------------

Realm treats each embedded object as nested data inside of a parent object.
An embedded object inherits the lifecycle of its parent object.
It cannot exist as an independent Realm object.
Embedded objects have the following properties:

- Embedded objects are deleted when their parent object is deleted
  or their parent no longer references them.
- You cannot reassign an embedded object to a different parent object.
- you cannot link to an embedded object from multiple parent objects.
- You can only query an embedded object by accessing it through its parent object.

Declare an embedded objects by passing `ObjectType.embeddedObject
<https://pub.dev/documentation/realm_common/latest/realm_common/ObjectType.html>`__
to the ``@RealmModel()`` annotation.
Embedded objects must be nullable when defining them in the parent object's
``RealmModel``. You must also include the embedded object's schema in the realm's
:flutter-sdk:`Configuration <realm/Configuration-class.html>`.

The following example shows how to model an embedded object in a Realm schema.
The ``_Address`` model is embedded within the ``_Person`` model.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/data_types_test.snippet.embedded-object-model.dart
   :language: dart

You can use the :flutter-sdk:`parent <realm/EmbeddedObjectExtension/parent.html>`
property to access the parent of the embedded object. 

The following example shows the unique considerations when working with embedded objects.
The example uses the ``Address`` embedded object generated from the ``_Address``
``RealmModel`` in the above schema.

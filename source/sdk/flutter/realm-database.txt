{+client-database+} is a reactive, object-oriented, cross-platform,
mobile database:

- **Reactive**: query the current state of data
  and subscribe to state changes like the result of a query, or even
  changes to a single object.

- **Object-oriented**: organizes data as objects, rather than rows,
  documents, or columns.

- **Cross-platform**: use the same database on iOS, Android,
  Linux, macOS, or Windows. Just define a schema for each SDK you use.

- **Mobile**: designed for the low-power, battery-sensitive, real-time
  environment of a mobile device.

{+client-database+} is an alternative to `SQLite <https://www.sqlite.org/index.html>`__
and :apple:`Core Data <documentation/coredata>`.


Features
--------

{+client-database+} supports many popular database features.

Queries
~~~~~~~

You can query {+client-database+} using platform-native queries or a
raw query language that works across platforms.

Indexes
~~~~~~~

Indexes are implemented as trees containing values of a given property
instead of a unique internal object key. This means that indexes only
support one column, and thus only one property, at a time.

Schemas
~~~~~~~

Every {+realm+} object has a schema. That schema is defined via a native
object in your SDK's language. Object schemas can include embedded lists
and relations between object instances.

Each {+realm+} uses a versioned schema. When that schema changes, you
must define a migration to move object data between schema versions.
Non-breaking schema changes, also referred to as additive schema changes, 
happen automatically. However, your SDK may require you to increase the 
local schema version to begin using the updated schema in your app. 
Breaking schema changes, also called destructive schema changes, require 
a migration function.

Sync
~~~~

{+sync+} adds network synchronization between a {+backend+} backend and
client devices on top of all of the functionality of {+client-database+}.
When you use {+client-database+} with Sync, {+realm+}s exist on device
just like when you only use {+client-database+}. However, changes to
the data stored in those {+realm+}s synchronize between all client
devices through a backend {+backend+} instance. That backend also stores
{+realm+} data in a cloud-based {+atlas+} cluster running MongoDB.

{+sync+} relies on a worker client that communicates with your
application backend in a dedicated thread in your application.
Additionally, synced {+realm+}s keep a history of changes to contained
objects. Sync uses this history to resolve conflicts between client
changes and backend changes.

Applications that use {+sync+} define their schema on the backend using
`JSON Schema <https://json-schema.org/learn/getting-started-step-by-step.html>`__.
Client applications must match that backend schema to synchronize data.
However, if you prefer to define your initial schema in your application's
programming language, you can use :ref:`Development Mode
<concept-development-mode>` to create a backend JSON Schema based on
native SDK objects as you write your application. However, once your
application is used for production purposes, you should alter your
schema using JSON Schema on the backend.

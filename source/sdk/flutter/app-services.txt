Overview
--------

You can connect your client apps to the {+service-short+} 
backend using the Flutter SDK. Backend functionality includes:

- :doc:`Connect to a Realm App </sdk/flutter/app-services/connect-to-app>`
- :doc:`Register Users </sdk/flutter/users/register>`
- :doc:`Register Users </sdk/flutter/users/authenticate>`

The Realm App Client
--------------------

To connect to your {+service-short+} backend, start with a 
:kotlin-sdk:`App <{+kotlin-sync-prefix+}io.realm.mongodb/-app/index.html>` object.
This object provides all other functionality related to 
the backend. Initialize an App with the Realm app ID, which you can 
:ref:`find in the Realm UI <find-your-app-id>`.

.. tip::

   To learn how to initialize the Realm App client, see
   :ref:`kotlin-connect-to-backend`.

Authentication & User Management
--------------------------------

One of the most challenging aspects of client development is implementing a 
robust and secure authentication system. With the {+service-short+} SDKs,
however, you can use any of the {+service+} authentication providers with
minimal backend setup and client-side code. With the authentication APIs,
you can implement the following functionality:

- Create new user accounts
- User log in and log out
- Multiple users logged on at the same time on the same device
- Link user accounts from different providers
- Store custom data for a particular user

.. tip::

   To learn how to set up authentication in your app, see
   :ref:`kotlin-authenticate`.

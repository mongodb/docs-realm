Freezing creates an immutable snapshot of data in a realm.
Frozen objects are not live and do not automatically update.
You cannot manually frozen objects.
They are snapshots of the object state at the time of freezing.
Once you create a frozen snapshot, it cannot be unfrozen.

You can freeze the following object types:

- :ref:`Realm <flutter-freeze-realm>`
- :ref:`RealmResults <flutter-freeze-realmresults>`
- :ref:`RealmObject <flutter-freeze-realmobject>`
- :ref:`RealmList <flutter-freeze-realmlist>`

.. _flutter-freeze-realm:

Freeze a Realm
--------------

Create a frozen snapshot of an entire realm with :flutter-sdk:`Realm.freeze()
<latest/realm/Realm/freeze.html>`. Once you finish working with the frozen realm,
you must close it to prevent memory leaks.

.. _flutter-freeze-realmresults:

Freeze RealmResults
-------------------

Create a frozen snapshot of ``RealmResults`` with :flutter-sdk:`RealmResults.freeze()
<latest/realm/RealmResults/freeze.html>`. Once you finish working with the frozen data,
you must close the realm associated with it to prevent memory leaks.

.. _flutter-freeze-realmobject:

Freeze a RealmObject
--------------------

Create a frozen snapshot of a ``RealmObject`` with :flutter-sdk:`RealmObject.freeze()
<latest/realm/RealmObject/freeze.html>`. Once you finish working with the frozen data,
you must close the realm associated with it to prevent memory leaks.

.. _flutter-freeze-realmlist:

Freeze a RealmList in a RealmObject
-----------------------------------

Create a frozen snapshot of ``RealmList`` in a ``RealmObject``
with :flutter-sdk:`RealmList.freeze() <latest/realm/RealmList/freeze.html>`.
Once you finish working with the frozen data,
you must close the realm associated with it to prevent memory leaks.

.. _flutter-isfrozen:

Check if Data Is Frozen
-----------------------

Check if any of the freezable data types are frozen with the ``isFrozen`` property.
``isFrozen`` returns ``true`` if an object is frozen and ``false`` if it is a live object.

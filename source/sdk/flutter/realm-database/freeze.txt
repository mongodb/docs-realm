Freezing creates an immutable snapshot of data in a realm.
Frozen objects are not live and do not automatically update.
You cannot manually frozen objects.
They are snapshots of the object state at the time of freezing.
Once you create a frozen snapshot, it cannot be unfrozen.

The following object types have a ``freeze()`` method which you can use
to freeze the object:

- :flutter-sdk:`Realm.freeze() <>`
- :flutter-sdk:`RealmResults.freeze() <>`
- :flutter-sdk:`RealmObject.freeze() <>`
- :flutter-sdk:`RealmList.freeze() <>`

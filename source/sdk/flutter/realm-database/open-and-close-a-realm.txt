.. _flutter-open-realm:

Open a Realm
------------

Use the :flutter-sdk:`Configuration <realm/Configuration-class.html>` class
to control the specifics of the realm you
would like to open, including the schema.

.. _flutter-open-local-only-realm:

Open a Local-Only Realm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a realm that only persists data locally,
create a configuration with :flutter-sdk:`Configuration.local() <realm/Realm-class.html>`.
You must provide a list of schemas as an argument.

Pass the ``Configuration`` to the :flutter-sdk:`Realm <realm/Realm-class.html>` constructor.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/open_realm_test.snippet.open-realm.dart
   :language: dart

You can now use that realm instance to work with objects in the database.

Open a Synced Realm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To open a realm that synchronizes data with Atlas using Device Sync,
refer to :ref:`Open a Synced Realm <flutter-open-synced-realm>`.

Open an In-Memory Realm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a realm that runs entirely in memory without being persisted to a file,
create your ``Configuration`` with :flutter-sdk:`Configuration.inMemory() <realm/Configuration/inMemory.html>`.
You must provide a list of schemas as an argument.
In-memory realms **cannot** also be read-only.

Pass the ``Configuration`` to the :flutter-sdk:`Realm <realm/Realm-class.html>` constructor.


.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/open_realm_test.snippet.in-memory-realm.dart
   :language: dart

.. _flutter-configure-realm:

Configure a Realm
-----------------

You can add optional properties to the realm's ``Configuration``.

.. _flutter-open-read-only-realm:

Open a Read-Only Realm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can open an existing realm in read-only mode. To open a read-only realm,
add ``readOnly: true`` to your ``Configuration`` object.

You can only open *existing* realms in read-only mode.
If you try to write to a read-only realm, it throws an error.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/open_realm_test.snippet.read-only-realm.dart
   :language: dart

.. _flutter-set-custom-fifo:

Set Custom FIFO Special Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set a value for Realm's `FIFO special files
<https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.3.0?topic=csf-fifo-special-files>`_ location.
Opening a realm creates a number of lightweight FIFO special files
that coordinate access to the realm across threads and processes.
If the realm file is in a location that doesn't allow for the creation of
FIFO special files (such as FAT32 filesystems), then the realm cannot be opened.
In this case, Realm needs a different location to store these files.
Add ``fifoFilesFallbackPath: <Your Custom FIFO File Path>`` to your ``Configuration`` object.

This property is ignored if the directory for the realm file allows
FIFO special files.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/open_realm_test.snippet.fifo-file.dart
   :language: dart

.. _flutter-initial-data-callback:

Add Initial Data to Realm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use :flutter-sdk:`initialDataCallback() <realm/InitialDataCallback.html>` to invoke
a callback function the first time that you open a realm.
The function only executes the first time that the realm on the device.
The realm instance passed to the callback function already has a write transaction open,
so you do not need to wrap write operations in a ``Realm.write()`` transaction block.
``initialDataCallback`` can be useful for adding initial data to your application
the first time that it is opened on a device.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/open_realm_test.snippet.initial-data-callback.dart
   :language: dart
   :emphasize-lines: 1-3, 6

.. _flutter-customize-default-configuration:

Customize Default Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can customize the default path where Realm stores database files
and the default name given to database files.

Use the static :flutter-sdk:`Configuration.defaultRealmName <realm/Configuration/defaultRealmName.html>`
and :flutter-sdk:`Configuration.defaultRealmPath <realm/Configuration/defaultRealmPath.html>`
to set default configuration for all realms opened within an application.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/open_realm_test.snippet.default-realm-name-path.dart
   :language: dart

You can also check where realm stores the files by default using the static getter
:flutter-sdk:`Configuration.defaultStoragePath <realm/Configuration/defaultStoragePath.html>`.
The value for this property varies depending on the platform you are using the SDK
on and whether you are using the Dart or Flutter versions of Realm.
Check the value of ``Configuration.defaultStoragePath`` in your application
to see where realm files are stored in your environment.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/open_realm_test.snippet.default-storage-path.dart
   :language: dart

Manage Schema Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For more information about managing schema changes when configuring a realm,
refer to the :ref:`Update a Realm Object Schema documentation
<flutter-update-realm-object-schema>`.

.. _flutter-close-realm:

Close a Realm
-------------

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Flutter
      :tabid: flutter

      Once you've finished working with a realm, close it to prevent memory leaks.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/open_realm_test.snippet.close-realm.dart
         :language: dart

   .. tab:: Dart
      :tabid: dart

      Once you've finished working with a realm, close it to prevent memory leaks.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/open_realm_test.snippet.close-realm.dart
         :language: dart

      If you're running a Dart CLI application, to prevent the process from hanging
      call :flutter-sdk:`Realm.shutdown() <realm/Realm/shutdown.html>`.

      .. code-block:: dart

         Realm.shutdown();

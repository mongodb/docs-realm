.. _flutter-open-realm:

Open a Realm
------------

Use the :flutter-sdk:`Configuration <realm/Configuration-class.html>` class
to control the specifics of the {+realm+} you
would like to open, including schema.

.. _flutter-open-local-only-realm:

Open a Local-Only Realm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a {+realm+} that only persists data locally,
create a configuration with :flutter-sdk:`Configuration.local() <realm/Realm-class.html>`.
You must provide a list of schemas as an argument.

Pass the ``Configuration`` to the :flutter-sdk:`Realm <realm/Realm-class.html>` constructor.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/open_realm_test.snippet.open-realm.dart
   :language: dart

You can now use that {+realm+} instance to work with objects in the database.

Open a Synced Realm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To open a {+realm+} that synchronizes data with {+atlas+} using {+sync+}, 
refer to :ref:`Open a Synced Realm <flutter-open-synced-realm>`.

Open an In-Memory Realm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a realm that runs entirely in memory without being written to a file,
create your ``Configuration`` with :flutter-sdk:`Configuration.inMemory() <realm/Configuration/inMemory.html>`. 
You must provide a list of schemas as an argument.
In-memory realms **cannot** also be read-only.

Pass the ``Configuration`` to the :flutter-sdk:`Realm <realm/Realm-class.html>` constructor.


.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/open_realm_test.codeblock.in-memory-realm.dart
   :language: dart

.. _flutter-configure-realm: 

Configure a Realm
-----------------

You can add optional properties to the {+realm+}'s ``Configuration``. 

.. _flutter-open-read-only-realm:

Open a Read-Only Realm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can open an existing realm in read-only mode. To open a read-only realm, 
add ``readOnly: true`` to your ``Configuration`` object.

You can only open *existing* realms in read-only mode. 
If you try to write to a read-only realm, it throws an error.

.. TODO(DOCSP-22732): refactor wth Configuration.inMemory()

.. _flutter-open-in-memory-realm:

Open an In-Memory Realm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a realm that runs entirely in memory without being written to a file,
add ``inMemory: true`` to your ``Configuration`` object. 
In-memory realms **cannot** also be read-only.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/open_realm_test.snippet.in-memory-realm.dart
   :language: dart

.. TODO(DOCSP-22732): refactor wth Configuration.local()

.. _flutter-set-custom-fifo:

Set Custom FIFO Special Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set a value for Realm's `FIFO special files 
<https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.3.0?topic=csf-fifo-special-files>`_ location. 
Opening a realm creates a number of lightweight FIFO special files 
that coordinate access to the realm across threads and processes. 
If the realm file is in a location that doesn't allow for the creation of 
FIFO special files (such as FAT32 filesystems), then the realm cannot be opened.
In this case, Realm needs a different location to store these files. 
Add ``fifoFilesFallbackPath: <Your Custom FIFO File Path>`` to your ``Configuration`` object.

This property is ignored if the directory for the realm file allows
FIFO special files.

   :language: dart

.. _flutter-close-realm: 

Close a Realm
-------------

Once you've finished working with a {+realm+}, close it to prevent memory leaks.

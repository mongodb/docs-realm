.. _flutter-read-data:

Read from Realm Database
------------------------

A read from a realm generally consists of the following
steps:

- Get all objects of a certain type from the realm.
- Optionally, :ref:`filter <flutter-filter-results>` the results
  using the :ref:`Realm Query Language <rql>`.
- Optionally, :ref:`sort <flutter-sort-results>` the results using Realm Query Language.

.. _flutter-query-objects:

Query All Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Retrieve a collection of all objects of a data model in the realm with the
:flutter-sdk:`Realm.all() <realm/Realm/all.html>` method.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.snippet.query-all-realm-objects.dart
   :language: dart

.. _flutter-query-list-realm-objects:

Query List of RealmObjects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can query any list of :flutter-sdk:`RealmObjects <realm/RealmObject-mixin.html>`.
For more information on querying, see :ref:`Filter Results <flutter-filter-results>`.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/read_write_data_test.snippet.query-realm-list.dart
   :language: dart

.. _flutter-filter-results:

Filter Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Filter a ``RealmList`` to retrieve a specific segment
of objects with the :flutter-sdk:`Realm.query() <realm/Realm/query.html>` method.
In the ``query()`` method's argument, use Realm Query Language to perform filtering.
Realm Query Language is a string-based query language that you can use to retrieve
objects from a realm.

For more information on constructing queries, refer to the
:ref:`Realm Query Language reference documentation <rql>`.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.snippet.query-realm-objects-with-filter.dart
   :language: dart

.. _flutter-sort-results:

Sort Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sort the results using the :ref:`Realm Query Language SORT() operator
<rql-sort-distinct-limit>` in the ``query()`` method's argument.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.snippet.query-realm-objects-with-sort.dart
   :language: dart

.. _flutter-write-operations:

Write Operations
----------------

Once you've opened a realm, you can create objects within it using a
:flutter-sdk:`Realm.write() transaction block <realm/Realm/write.html>`.
All operations within a write transaction are :wikipedia:`atomic <Atomicity_(database_systems)>`.
If an operation in the write transaction fails, the whole transaction fails,
Realm throws an error, and no changes from the transaction block are applied to the realm.

.. code-block:: dart

   realm.write((){
     // ...write data to realm
   });

You can also return values from the write transaction callback function.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/read_write_data_test.snippet.return-from-write.dart
   :language: dart

.. _flutter-create-objects:

Create Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a new Realm object, instantiate an instance of the object class
and add it to the realm in a write transaction block with
:flutter-sdk:`Realm.add() <realm/Realm/add.html>`.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.snippet.create-realm-object.dart
   :language: dart

.. _flutter-update-objects:

Update Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _flutter-update-object-properties:

Update Object Properties
````````````````````````

To modify an object's properties, update the properties in a write transaction block.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.snippet.update-realm-object.dart
   :language: dart

.. _flutter-upsert-objects:

Upsert Objects
``````````````

To upsert an object, call :flutter-sdk:`Realm.add() <realm/Realm/add.html>`
with the optional ``update`` flag set to ``true`` inside a transaction block.
The operation either inserts a new object with the given primary key or
updates an existing object that already has that primary key.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/read_write_data_test.snippet.upsert.dart
   :language: dart
   :emphasize-lines: 10

.. _flutter-delete-objects:

Delete Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _flutter-delete-single-object:

Delete a Single Object
``````````````````````

Delete an object by calling the :flutter-sdk:`Realm.delete() <realm/Realm/delete.html>`
method in a write transaction block.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.snippet.delete-one-realm-object.dart
   :language: dart

.. _flutter-delete-multiple-objects:

Delete Multiple Objects
```````````````````````

Delete multiple objects with the :flutter-sdk:`Realm.deleteMany()
<realm/Realm/deleteMany.html>` method in a write transaction block.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.snippet.delete-many-realm-objects.dart
   :language: dart

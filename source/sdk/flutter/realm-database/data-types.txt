The Flutter SDK currently only supports Dart-language data types. 
The Flutter SDK supports Dart-language data types, a limited subset of
`BSON <https://bsonspec.org/>`__ types, and :wikipedia:`UUID <Universally_unique_identifier>`.


.. _flutter-dart-types:

Dart Types
----------

Realm supports the following Dart types:

- ``int``
- ``double``
- ``bool``
- ``String``
- ``List<T>``, where T is any of the supported data types or a 
  `RealmModel <https://pub.dev/documentation/realm_common/latest/realm_common/RealmModel-class.html>`__

.. _flutter-reference-realm-object:

Reference Realm Objects
-----------------------

You can also reference one or more Realm objects from another. Learn more in the 
:ref:`relationship properties documentation <flutter-client-relationships>`.

.. _flutter-additional-types:

Additional Supported Data Types
-------------------------------

ObjectId
~~~~~~~~

ObjectId is a MongoDB-specific 12-byte unique value which you can use as an
identifier for objects. ObjectId is indexable and can be used as a primary key.

To define a property as an ObjectId, set its type as ``ObjectId`` in
your :ref:`object model <flutter-create-model>`. Create a Realm
object within a write transaction. 

.. code-block:: dart

   @RealmModel()
   class _ObjectIdPrimaryKey {
   @PrimaryKey()
   late ObjectId id;
   }

Call ``ObjectId()`` to set any unique identifier properties of
your object. Alternatively, pass a string
to ``ObjectId()`` to set the unique identifier property to a specific value.

.. code-block:: dart

   ObjectId id = ObjectId();
   ObjectIdPrimaryKey obj = ObjectIdPrimaryKey(id);

UUID
~~~~

``UUID`` (Universal Unique Identifier) is a 16-byte :wikipedia:`unique value
<Universally_unique_identifier>`. You can use ``UUID`` as an identifier for
objects. ``UUID`` is indexable and you can use it as a
primary key.

.. note:: Using UUID Instead of ObjectId

   In general, you can use ``UUID`` for any fields that function as a unique
   identifier. Using ``UUID`` might be particularly useful if you are migrating
   data not stored in MongoDB since it is likely that your object's unique
   identifiers are already of a ``UUID`` type. Alternatively, using ``ObjectId``
   might be useful for a collection of data that already exists in MongoDB.

To define a property as a UUID, set its type as ``UuidValue`` in
your :ref:`object model <flutter-create-model>`. Create a Realm
object within a write transaction. 

.. code-block:: dart

   @RealmModel()
   class _UuidPrimaryKey {
      @PrimaryKey()
      late UuidValue id;
   }

To set any unique identifier properties of
your object to a random value, call ``UuidValue()``. Alternatively, pass a string
to ``UuidValue()`` to set the unique identifier property to a specific value.

.. code-block:: dart

   UuidValue uuid = UuidValue();
   UuidPrimaryKey obj = UuidPrimaryKey(uuid);

An **object schema** is a configuration object that defines the properties and
relationships of a Realm object. Realm client
applications define object schemas with the native class implementation in their
respective language using the Object Schema.

Object schemas specify constraints on object properties such as the data
type of each property and whether or not a property is required. Schemas can
also define :ref:`relationships <flutter-client-relationships>` between object
types in a realm.

.. _flutter-create-model:

Create Model
------------

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Import Realm

      Import the Realm SDK package at the top of your file.

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: Flutter
            :tabid: flutter

            .. code-block:: dart
               :caption: schemas.dart

               import 'package:realm/realm.dart';

         .. tab:: Dart
            :tabid: dart

            .. code-block:: dart
               :caption: schemas.dart

               import 'package:realm_dart/realm.dart';

   .. step:: Create Generated File Part Directive

      Add a part directive to include the ``RealmObject`` file that you generate in step 4
      in the same package as the file you're currently working on.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/schemas.snippet.part-directive.dart
         :language: dart
         :caption: schemas.dart

   .. step:: Create RealmModel

      Create the model for your Realm schema in a private class.
      You must include the annotation `RealmModel <https://pub.dev/documentation/realm_common/latest/realm_common/RealmModel-class.html>`__
      at the top of the class definition. Prepend the class name with an underscore
      to make it private. You'll generate the public ``RealmObject`` in step 4.

      Add fields to the ``RealmModel``.
      You can add all :ref:`supported data types <flutter-data-types>`.
      Include additional behavior using :ref:`property annotations <flutter-property-annotations>`.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/schemas.snippet.create-realm-model.dart
         :language: dart
         :caption: schemas.dart

      .. seealso::

         - :ref:`Supported Data Types - Flutter SDK <flutter-data-types>`
         - :ref:`Property Annotations - Flutter SDK <flutter-property-annotations>`

   .. step:: Generate RealmObject

      Generate the ``RealmObject``, which you'll use in your application:

      .. tabs::

         .. tab:: Flutter
            :tabid: flutter

            .. code-block::

               flutter pub run realm generate

         .. tab:: Dart
            :tabid: dart

            .. code-block::

               dart run realm_dart generate

      This command generates the file in the same directory as your model file.
      It has the name you specified in the part directive of step 2.

      .. tip:: Track the generated file

         Track the generated file in your version control system, such as git.

      .. example:: File structure after generating model

         .. code-block::

            .
            ├── schemas.dart
            ├── schemas.g.dart // newly generated file
            ├── myapp.dart
            └── ...rest of application

   .. step:: Use RealmObject in Application

      Use the ``RealmObject`` that you generated in the previous step in your application.
      Since you included the generated file as part of the same package
      where you defined the ``RealmModel`` in step 2, access the ``RealmObject``
      by importing the file with the ``RealmModel``.

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/define_realm_object_schema_usage_test.snippet.use-realm-object.dart
         :language: dart
         :caption: myapp.dart


.. _flutter-realm-schema:

Using Schemas with Device Sync
------------------------------

A **App Services Schema** is a list of valid object schemas that
each define an object type that a App may persist.
All synced objects in a realm must conform to the App Services Schema.

Client applications provide a Object Schema when they open a realm. If a
realm already contains data, then it already has a schema, and when it is opened,
Realm Database validates the schema on the client against the existing schema.

You can define App Services Schemas in the following ways:

- Automatically with the Object Schema if :ref:`development mode is enabled
  <concept-development-mode>`.
- Explicitly define the App Services Schema with App Services.

In your schema you must use the ``MapTo("_id")`` annotation with your primary key
in the ``RealmModel`` to successfully sync your Object Schema with App Services.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/schemas.snippet.sync-schema.dart
   :language: dart
   :emphasize-lines: 3-5

For further information on defining your schema and which of these approaches you
should consider for your application, refer to the :ref:`Create a Realm Schema documentation
<create-schema-for-backend-realm-app>`.


.. _flutter-client-relationships:

Define Relationship Properties
------------------------------

You can reference other Realm models from your Realm model.
This lets you create the following types of relationships between Realm objects:

- :ref:`Many-to-one <flutter-many-to-one-relationship>`
- :ref:`Many-to-many <flutter-many-to-many-relationship>`

.. important:: No directly embedding objects

   You cannot directly embed one Realm object in another with the Flutter SDK
   at this time. You can only reference another Realm object.

.. _flutter-many-to-one-relationship:

Many-to-One
~~~~~~~~~~~

To set up a many-to-one or one-to-one relationship,
create a property in your model whose type is another model.
Multiple objects can reference the same object.

.. include:: /includes/note-to-one-relationships-must-be-optional.rst

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/schemas.snippet.many-to-one-models.dart
   :language: dart

.. _flutter-many-to-many-relationship:

Many-to-Many
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can create a relationship between one object and any number of objects
using a property of type ``List<T>`` in your application, where T is a Realm model class.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/schemas.snippet.many-to-many-models.dart
   :language: dart

.. _flutter-property-annotations:

Property Annotations
--------------------

Use annotations to add functionality to properties in your Realm object models.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`Supported Data Types - Flutter SDK <flutter-data-types>`

.. _flutter-required-optional-properties:

Required and Optional Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Dart, value types are implicitly non-nullable, but can be made optional (nullable) by appending
`?  <https://dart.dev/null-safety>`__. Include ``?`` to make properties optional.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/schemas.snippet.property-annotations.dart
   :language: dart
   :emphasize-lines: 5

.. _flutter-default-field-values:

Default Field Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the built-in language features to assign a default value to a property.
Assign a default value in the property declaration.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/schemas.snippet.property-annotations.dart
   :language: dart
   :emphasize-lines: 7

.. _flutter-primary-key:

PrimaryKey
~~~~~~~~~~

The `PrimaryKey <https://pub.dev/documentation/realm_common/latest/realm_common/PrimaryKey-class.html>`__
annotation indicates a primary key property.
The primary key is a unique identifier for an object in a realm.
No other objects of the same type may share an object's primary key.

Important aspects of primary keys:

- You cannot change a primary key after adding an object to a realm.
- Only add a primary key to one property in a RealmModel.
- Only ``String``, ``int``, ``ObjectId``, and ``Uuid`` types can be primary keys.
- Realm automatically indexes primary keys.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/schemas.snippet.property-annotations.dart
   :language: dart
   :emphasize-lines: 2-3

Ignored
~~~~~~~

If you add the `Ignored <https://pub.dev/documentation/realm_common/latest/realm_common/Ignored-class.html>`__
annotation to a property in your ``RealmModel``, the :ref:`realm object generator
<flutter-generate-realm-object>` doesn't include the property in the ``RealmObject`` schema.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/schemas.snippet.property-annotations.dart
   :language: dart
   :emphasize-lines: 9-10

Indexed
~~~~~~~

Add the `Indexed <https://pub.dev/documentation/realm_common/latest/realm_common/Indexed-class.html>`__ annotation
to create an index on the field. Indexes slightly slow down insertion, but can greatly
speed up queries.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/schemas.snippet.property-annotations.dart
   :language: dart
   :emphasize-lines: 12-13

MapTo
~~~~~

The `MapTo <https://pub.dev/documentation/realm_common/latest/realm_common/MapTo-class.html>`__ annotation
indicates that a property should be persisted under a different name.
It's useful when opening a Realm across different bindings where code style conventions can differ.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/schemas.snippet.property-annotations.dart
   :language: dart
   :emphasize-lines: 15-16

.. _flutter-generate-realm-object:

Generate the RealmObject
------------------------

Once you've completed your Realm model, you must generate the
:flutter-sdk:`RealmObject <realm/RealmObject-mixin.html>` class to use it in your application.

Run the following command to generate ``RealmObjects``:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Flutter
      :tabid: flutter

      .. code-block::

         flutter pub run realm generate

   .. tab:: Dart
      :tabid: dart

      .. code-block::

         dart run realm_dart generate

Running this creates a public class in a new file in the directory
where you defined the ``RealmModel`` class per the :ref:`Create Model section <flutter-create-model>`.

The generated file has the same base name as the file with your ``RealmModel``,
ending with ``.g.dart``. For example if the file with your ``RealmModel``
is named ``schemas.dart``, the generated file will be ``schemas.g.dart``.

.. note::

   Remember to include the generated file in a part directive in
   your ``RealmModel`` definition file.

   .. code-block:: dart
      :caption: schemas.dart
      :emphasize-lines: 3

      // ...import packages

      part 'schemas.g.dart';

      @RealmModel()
      // ...model definition

If you'd like to watch your data models to generate ``RealmObjects`` whenever there's a change,
include the ``--watch`` flag in your command.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Flutter
      :tabid: flutter

      .. code-block::

         flutter pub run realm generate --watch

   .. tab:: Dart
      :tabid: dart

      .. code-block::

         dart run realm_dart generate --watch

To clean the generator caches, include the ``--clean`` flag in your command.
Cleaning the generator cache can be useful when debugging.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Flutter
      :tabid: flutter

      .. code-block::

         flutter pub run realm generate --clean

   .. tab:: Dart
      :tabid: dart

      .. code-block::

         dart run realm_dart generate --clean

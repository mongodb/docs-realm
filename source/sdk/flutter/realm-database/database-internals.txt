Realm vs Other Databases
------------------------

The Realm data model is similar to both relational and
document databases but has distinct differences from both. To underscore
these differences, it's helpful to highlight what a realm **is
not**:

A realm is not a single, application-wide database.
    Applications based on other database systems generally store all of their
    data in a single database. Apps often split data across multiple
    realms to organize data more efficiently and to enforce access controls.

A realm is not a relational table.
    Normalized tables in relational databases only store one type of
    information, such as street addresses or items in a store inventory. A
    realm can contain any number of object types that are relevant to a
    given domain.

A realm is not a collection of schemaless documents.
    Document databases don't necessarily enforce a strict schema for the data in
    each collection. While similar to documents in form, every Realm object
    conforms to a schema for a specific object type in the realm. An object
    cannot contain a property that is not described by its schema.

Live Queries
------------

You can read back the data that you have stored
in Realm by finding, filtering, and sorting objects.

To get the best performance from Realm as your app grows and your
queries become more complex, design your app's data access patterns
around a solid understanding of Realm read characteristics.

Read Characteristics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you design your app's data access patterns around the following three key
characteristics of reads in Realm, you can be confident you are reading 
data as efficiently as possible.

- Results are not copies: results to a query are not copies of your data.
  Modifying the results of a query will modify the data on disk directly.
  This memory mapping also means that results are live: that is, they always
  reflect the current state on disk.

- Results are lazy: Realm only runs a query when you actually request the results
  of that query. You can also chain several query operations
  without requiring extra work to process the intermediate state.

- References are retained: one benefit of Realm object model is that
  Realm automatically retains all of an object's :ref:`relationships <flutter-client-relationships>`
  as direct references.

.. _flutter-live-object:

Live Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~

All Realm objects are **live objects**, which means they
automatically update whenever they're modified. Realm emits a
:ref:`notification event <flutter-react-to-changes>` whenever any property
changes.

You can use live objects to work with object-oriented data natively
without an :wikipedia:`ORM <Object-relational_mapping>` tool. Live
objects are direct proxies to the underlying stored data, which means
that a live object doesn't directly contain data. Instead, a live object
always references the most up-to-date data on disk and :wikipedia:`lazy
loads <Lazy_loading>` property values when you access them from a
:ref:`collection <flutter-collections>`. This means that a realm
can contain many objects but only pay the performance cost for data that
the application is actually using.

Valid write operations on a live object automatically persist to the
realm. If you are using :ref:`Atlas Device Sync <flutter-sync>`,
the updates also propagate to any other synced clients.
You do not need to call an update method, modify the realm, or otherwise "push" updates.

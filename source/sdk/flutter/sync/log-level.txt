You can set the realm sync client log level. You might want to do this
to log different amounts of data depending on the app's environment.

To learn more about all available logging levels, refer to the
:flutter-sdk:`RealmLogLevel documentation <realm/RealmLogLevel-class.html>`.

Set the log level to ``debug`` or ``trace`` to diagnose and troubleshoot errors
while developing your application. For production deployments,
decrease the log level for improved performance.

To configure the log level, set the static property :flutter-sdk:`Realm.logger.level <realm/Realm/logger.html>`
to one of the ``Logger`` levels provided by ``RealmLogLevel``.

You must set the log level **before** you open a synced realm.

You can set the realm sync client log level. You might want to do this
to log different amounts of data depending on where you app is running.

To learn more about all available logging levels, refer to the
:flutter-sdk:`RealmLogLevel documentation <realm/RealmLogLevel-class.html>`.

To diagnose and troubleshoot errors while developing your application,
set the log level to ``debug`` or ``trace``. For production deployments,
decrease the log level for improved performance.

To configure the log level, set the static property :flutter-sdk:`Realm.logger <realm/Realm/logger.html>`
to a `Logger <https://pub.dev/documentation/logger/latest/logger/Logger-class.html>`__
with it's ``level`` property set to one of the ``Logger`` levels provided by
``RealmLogLevel``. You must also import ``Logger`` from the `logging <https://pub.dev/packages/logger>`__
package, which is also installed when you add the Realm package to your app.

Set the log level for realms using Device Sync:

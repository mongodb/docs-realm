Sync Data from Multiple Processes
=================================

You can use a single realm database to synchronize data from multiple processes
using Atlas Device Sync.

Examples of scenarios where you might want to open a synced realm in a multiple
process include:

- A multi-window desktop application where each window writes to the same synced realm.
- A server application that writes to a synced realm from multiple processes.

On a high level, syncing data to a realm from multiple processes consists
of the following:

#. Creating a single **main process** that opens a Realm using a standard flexible
   sync configuration. The main process handles synchronization.
#. Creating one or more **secondary processes** that open the same realm using a
   disconnected sync configuration. The secondary processes can read
   and write data to the realm.

To open a synced realm in the main process, open the realm using the
:flutter-sdk:`Configuration.flexibleSync() <realm/Configuration/flexibleSync.html>`
constructor. For more information, refer to :ref:`Open a Synced Realm <flutter-open-synced-realm>`.

To open a synced realm in a secondary process, create a ``Configuration`` with the
:flutter-sdk:`Configuration.disconnectedSync() <realm/Configuration/disconnectedSync.html>`
constructor. Include the schema and any additional optional named arguments.

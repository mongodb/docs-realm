This page describes how to open a synced {+realm+}. To learn how to open and configure non-synced
{+realm+}s, see :ref:`Open and Close a Realm <flutter-open-close-realm>`.

Before You Begin
----------------

Before you open a {+realm+} with Flexible Sync in a Flutter application:

#. :ref:`Configure Flexible Sync on the backend <enable-flexible-sync>`
#. :ref:`Initialize the {+app+} client <flutter-connect-to-backend>`
#. :ref:`Authenticate a user <flutter-authenticate>` in your client project

Open a Synced Realm
-------------------

To open a synced {+realm+}, pass a logged in user, a list of
Realm object schemas, and additional optional parameters to the
:flutter-sdk:`Configuration.sync() <realm/Configuration/sync.html>` constructor.
Then, pass the configuration to :flutter-sdk:`Realm() <realm/Realm-class.html>`
to open an instance of the realm.

   :language: dart

Once you open a synced {+realm+}, :ref:`configure and manage the sync session
<flutter-manage-sync-session>`.

Configure a Realm
-----------------

For more information on additional configuration options, refer to 
:ref:`Configure a Realm <flutter-configure-realm>`.

Close a Realm
-------------

Once you've finished working with a synced {+realm+}, close it to prevent memory leaks.

   :language: dart

This page describes how to open a synced realm using Device Sync.
To learn how to open and configure non-synced realms,
see :ref:`Open and Close a Realm <flutter-open-close-realm>`.

Before You Begin
----------------

Before you open a realm with Flexible Sync in a Flutter application:

#. :ref:`Configure Flexible Sync on the backend <enable-flexible-sync>`.
   You must configure Flexible Sync in the backend before you can use it with your
   client application.
#. :ref:`Initialize the App client <flutter-connect-to-backend>`.
#. :ref:`Authenticate a user <flutter-authenticate>` in your client project.

Open a Synced Realm
-------------------

To open a synced realm, pass a logged in user, a list of
Realm object schemas, and additional optional parameters to the
:flutter-sdk:`Configuration.flexibleSync() <realm/Configuration/flexibleSync.html>` constructor.
Then, pass the configuration to :flutter-sdk:`Realm() <realm/Realm-class.html>`
to open an instance of the realm.

   :language: dart

Once you open a synced realm, :ref:`configure and manage the sync session
<flutter-manage-sync-session>`.

Configure a Realm
-----------------

For more information on additional configuration options, refer to
:ref:`Configure a Realm <flutter-configure-realm>`.

Close a Realm
-------------

Once you've finished working with a synced realm, close it to prevent memory leaks.

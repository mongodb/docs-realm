When writing data to a synced realm using Flexible Sync, you can use the same APIs
as writing to a local realm. However, there are some differences
in behavior to keep in mind as you develop your application.
To learn more about reading and writing data to a realm,
refer to :ref:`Read & Write Data <flutter-read-write-data>`.

Examples on This Page
---------------------

The examples on this page use an Atlas App Services App with the following 
Device Sync configuration and a client app with the following Realm SDK 
data model and subscriptions.

Device Sync is configured with the following queryable fields:

- ``_id`` (always included)
- ``miles``
- ``ownerId``

Device Sync has permissions configured to let users read and write only their own
data:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "rules": {},
     "defaultRoles": [
       {
         "name": "owner-read-write",
         "applyWhen": {},
         "read": {
           "ownerId": "%%user.id"
         },
         "write": {
           "ownerId": "%%user.id"
         }
       }
     ]
   }

The examples on this page use the following schema:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/write_to_synced_realm_test.snippet.realm-model.dart
   :language: dart

Using that schema, the examples configure the synced realm to 
synchronize objects matching this subscription query:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/write_to_synced_realm_test.snippet.subscription-setup.dart
   :language: dart

Write to a Synced Realm
-----------------------

When you write to a synced realm, your write operations must match *both*
of the following:

- **The sync subscription query.**
    - If your write operation doesn't match the query in the subscription,
      the write reverts with a non-fatal compensating write error (ErrorCompensatingWrite).
    - To learn more about compensating write errors and how to avoid them,
      refer to the :ref:`Compensating Writes <flutter-compensating-writes>` section.
- **The Device Sync permissions** in your App Services App.
    - If your try to write data that doesn't match the Device Sync permissions expression,
      the write reverts with a non-fatal permission denied error (ErrorPermissionDenied).
    - To learn more about configuring Device Sync permissions for your app,
      refer to :ref:`sync-rules` and the :ref:`flexible-sync-permissions-guide`
      in the App Services documentation.

To learn more about permission denied errors, compensating write errors
and other Device Sync error types, refer to :ref:`sync-errors` in the App Services documentation.

.. _flutter-compensating-writes:

Compensating Writes
-------------------

Compensating write errors occur when you write data to a realm
that doesn't align with the realm's sync subscriptions.

When you write data that doesn't match a subscription, the following occurs:

#. Because the client realm has no concept of "illegal" writes,
   the write initially succeeds until realm resolves the changeset
   with the App Services backend.
#. Upon sync, the server applies the rules and permissions.
   The server determines that the user does not have authorization to perform the write.
#. The server sends a revert operation, called a "compensating write", back to the client.
#. The client's realm reverts the illegal write operation.

Any client-side writes to a given object between an illegal write to that object
and the corresponding compensating write will be lost.

Write Data to a Synced Realm - Flutter SDK
==========================================

When writing data to a synced realm using Flexible Sync, you can use the same APIs
as writing to a local realm database. However, there are some differences
in behavior to keep in mind as you develop your application.
For more information on reading and writing data to a realm,
refer to :ref:`Read & Write Data <flutter-read-write-data>`

Examples on This Page
---------------------

The examples on this page use a app with the following Device Sync configuration
and Realm SDK data model and subscriptions.

Device Sync is configured with the following queryable fields:

- ``_id`` (always included)
- ``ownerId``

Device Sync has permissions configured to let users read and write only their own
data:

.. code-block:: json
   :emphasize-lines: 5-13

   {
     "rules": {},
     "defaultRoles": [
       {
         "name": "owner-read-write",
         "applyWhen": {},
         "read": {
           "ownerId": "%%user.id"
         },
         "write": {
           "ownerId": "%%user.id"
         }
       }
     ]
   }

The examples on this page use the following schema, realm, and subscription query.

.. code-block:: dart

   // The rest of the example uses RealmObjects generated from these RealmModels
   @RealmModel()
   class _Car {
      @PrimaryKey()
      late ObjectId id;

      late String ownerId;
      late String make;
      late String? model;
      late int? miles;
   }

   // ... instantiate App and log in user

   final app = App(AppConfiguration(APP_ID));
   final user = await app.logIn(Credentials.anonymous());
   final config = Configuration.flexibleSync([Car.schema], user);
   final realm = Realm(config);

   // Add subscriptions
   realm.subscriptions.update((mutableSubscriptions) {
      // Get Cars from Atlas that match the Realm Query Language query.
      // Uses the queryable field `miles`.
      final newCarQuery = realm.query<Car>("miles < 100 OR miles == \$0", [null]);
      mutableSubscriptions.add(newCarQuery, "new-car-subscription");
   });
   await realm.subscriptions.waitForSynchronization();

Write to a Synced Realm
-----------------------

When you write to a synced realm, your write operations must match with *both*
of the following criteria:

- **The sync subscription query**. If your write operation doesn't match
  the query in the subscription, the write fails with a compensating write error.
    - To learn more about compensating write errors and how to avoid them,
      refer to the :ref:`Compensating Writes <flutter-compensating-writes>` section.
- **The Device Sync permissions** in your App Services App.
  If your try to write data that doesn't match the Device Sync permissions expression,
  the write fails with a permission denied error.
    - To learn more about configuring Device Sync permissions for your app,
      refer to :ref:`sync-rules` and the :ref:`flexible-sync-permissions-guide`
      in the App Services documentation.

.. code-block:: dart

   // Per the Device Sync permissions, users can only read and write data
   // where the `Car.ownerId` property matches their own user ID.
   final userId = app.currentUser!.id;

   realm.write((){
    // `oldCar` is initially written to the realm, then later removed
    // in a compensating write when the server processes the write.
    // This is because the `miles` property of `oldCar` doesn't match
    // the subscription query, which is only for cars with less than 100 miles.
    final oldCar = Car(ObjectId(), userId, 'Honda', miles: 90000);
    realm.add(oldCar);

    // `otherUsersCar` is initially written to the realm, then later removed
    // because it's `ownerId` property doesn't match the user ID of the user
    // making the request.
    final otherUsersCar = Car(ObjectId(), 'someOtherId', 'Ford');
    realm.add(otherUsersCar);

    // `newCar` is successfully written to the realm and synced to Atlas
    // because it's data matches the subscription query and it's `ownerId` field
    // matches the user ID.
    final newCar = Car(ObjectId(), userId, 'Toyota', miles: 2);
    realm.add(newCar);
   });

.. _flutter-compensating-writes:

Compensating Writes
-------------------

Compensating write errors occur when you write data to a realm locally
that doesn't align with the realm's sync subscriptions.

Because the local realm has no concept of "illegal" writes,
the write always initially succeeds locally.
Upon sync, the server will notice the illegal write. The server then undoes the change.
The undo operation, called a "compensating write", syncs back to the client
so the client's realm no longer has the illegal write.
Any local writes to a given object between an illegal write to that object
and the corresponding compensating write will be lost.

To learn more about compensating write errors and other Device Sync error types,
refer to :ref:`sync-errors` in the App Services documentation.

.. code-block:: dart

   final carId = ObjectId();
   final ownerId = app.currentUser!.id;

   realm.write(() {
    // `oldCar` is initially written to the realm, then later removed
    // in a compensating write when the server processes the write.
    // This is because the `miles` property of `oldCar` doesn't match
    // the subscription query, which is only for cars with less than 100 miles.
    final oldCar = Car(carId, ownerId, 'Honda', miles: 90000);
    realm.add(oldCar);
   });

   // Let changes sync to and from server
   await realm.syncSession.waitForUpload();
   await realm.syncSession.waitForDownload();

   final noCar = realm.find(carId);
   // The Car is no longer in the realm because of the compensating write
   // from the server.
   expect(noCar, isNull);

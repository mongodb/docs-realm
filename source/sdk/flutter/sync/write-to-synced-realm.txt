When writing data to a synced realm using Flexible Sync, you can use the same APIs
as writing to a local realm. However, there are some differences
in behavior to keep in mind as you develop your application.
To learn more about reading and writing data to a realm,
refer to :ref:`Read & Write Data <flutter-read-write-data>`.

When you write to a synced realm, your write operations must match *both*
of the following:

- **The sync subscription query.**
    - If your write operation doesn't match the query in the subscription,
      the write reverts with a non-fatal compensating write error (ErrorCompensatingWrite).
    - To learn more about compensating write errors and how to avoid them,
      refer to the :ref:`Compensating Writes <flutter-compensating-writes>` section.
- **The permissions** in your App Services App.
    - If your try to write data that doesn't match the permissions expression,
      the write reverts with a non-fatal permission denied error. In the client,
      this shows as an error (ErrorCompensatingWrite). On the server, you can see more
      details about how the write was denied was by a write filter in the role.
    - To learn more about configuring permissions for your app, see
      :ref:`sync-rules` and the :ref:`flexible-sync-permissions-guide` in the
      App Services documentation.

To learn more about permission denied errors, compensating write errors
and other Device Sync error types, refer to :ref:`sync-errors` in the App Services documentation.

Determining What Data Syncs
---------------------------

The examples on this page use an Atlas App Services App with the following 
Device Sync configuration and a client app with the following Realm SDK 
data model and subscriptions.

Device Sync is configured with the following queryable fields:

- ``_id`` (always included)
- ``miles``
- ``ownerId``

The App Services App has permissions configured to let users read and write only
their own data:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "name": "owner-read-write", 
     "apply_when": {},
     "document_filters": {
       "read": { "ownerId": "%%user.id" },
       "write": { "ownerId": "%%user.id" }
     },
     "read": true,
     "write": true
   }

The examples on this page use the following schema:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/write_to_synced_realm_test.snippet.realm-model.dart
   :language: dart

Using that schema, the examples configure the synced realm to 
synchronize objects matching this subscription query:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/write_to_synced_realm_test.snippet.subscription-setup.dart
   :language: dart

Write to a Synced Realm
-----------------------

Writes to Flexible Sync realms may broadly fall into one of two categories:

- **Successful writes**: The written object matches both the query subscription
  and the user's permissions. The object writes successfully to the realm,
  and syncs successfully to the App Services backend and other devices.

- **Compensating writes**: When the written object does not match
  the subscription query, or where the user does not have sufficient
  permissions to perform the write, Realm reverts the illegal write.

.. _flutter-successful-writes:

Successful Writes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the write matches both the :ref:`App Services permissions <permissions>`
and the :ref:`Flexible Sync subscription query
<flutter-flexible-sync-manage-subscriptions>` in the client, the Realm Flutter SDK
can successfully write the object to the synced realm. This object syncs with
the App Services backend when the device has a network connection.

TODO: make code example success only

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/write_to_synced_realm_test.snippet.write-synced-realm.dart
   :language: dart

.. _flutter-compensating-writes:

Compensating Writes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In some cases, a write that initially appears to succeed is actually an
illegal write. In these cases, the object writes to the database, but when
the database syncs to the backend, Realm reverts the write in a non-fatal
error operation called a compensating write. Compensating writes can occur
when:

- **Writes don't match the query subscription**: The written object matches
  the user's permissions, but does not match the query subscription.
- **Writes don't match permissions**: The written object matches the query
  subscription, but does not match the user's permissions.

In more detail, when you write data that is outside the bounds of a query
subscription or does not match the user's permissions, the following occurs:

#. Because the client realm has no concept of "illegal" writes,
   the write initially succeeds until realm resolves the changeset
   with the App Services backend.
#. Upon sync, the server applies the rules and permissions.
   The server determines that the user does not have authorization to perform the write.
#. The server sends a revert operation, called a "compensating write", back to the client.
#. The client's realm reverts the illegal write operation by deleting the illegal object from the realm.

Any client-side writes to a given object between an illegal write to that object
and the corresponding compensating write will be lost.

In practice, this may look like an object being written to the realm, and
then disappearing after the server sends the compensating write back to
the client.

To learn more about permission denied errors, compensating write errors
and other Device Sync error types, refer to :ref:`sync-errors` in the App Services documentation.

The :ref:`App Services logs <logs-sync>` contain more information about
why a compensating write error occurs.

.. _flutter-writes-outside-subscription:

Write that Don't Match the Query Subscription
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can only write objects to a Flexible Sync realm if they match the
subscription query. If you perform a write that does not match the
subscription query, Realm initially writes the object, but then performs
a compensating write. This is a non-fatal operation that
reverts an illegal write that does not match the subscription query.

If you want to write an object that does not match the query subscription,
open a different realm where the object matches the query
subscription. Alternately, you could write the object to a :ref:`local realm
<flutter-open-local-only-realm>` that does not enforce
permissions or subscription queries. There is no way to write an object
to a Flexible Sync realm that does not match the query subscription.

Code Example
++++++++++++

Given the configuration for the synced realm above, attempting to
write this object does not match the query subscription:

TODO: look if need to refactor

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/write_to_synced_realm_test.snippet.compensating-write.dart
   :language: dart

Client Error
++++++++++++

The error message in the client-side logs in this scenario is:

TODO: verify..i assume this one is different

.. code-block:: console

   Sync: Connection[1]: Session[1]: Received: ERROR "Client attempted a
   write that is outside of permissions or query filters; it has been
   reverted" (error_code=231, try_again=true, error_action=Warning)

App Services Error
++++++++++++++++++

The error message in the App Services logs in this scenario is:

TODO: verify

.. code-block:: console

   "FlexibleSync_Item": {
       "63bdfc40f16be7b1e8c7e4b7": "write to \"63bdfc40f16be7b1e8c7e4b7\"
       in table \"FlexibleSync_Item\" not allowed; object is outside of
       the current query view"
   }

.. _flutter-writes-outside-permissions:

Writes That Don't Match Permissions
```````````````````````````````````

Attempting to write to the client can also trigger a compensating write
error when the object does not match the user's server-side write permissions.

On the client, this type of write behaves the same as a write that doesn't
match the query subscription. In practice, this may look like the write
succeeding, but then the object "disappears" when Realm syncs with the
App Services backend and performs the compensating write.

Code Example
++++++++++++

TODO: verfiy if this description accurate for my code example

Given the permissions in the Device Sync configuration detailed above,
attempting to write an object where the ``ownerId`` property does not match
the ``user.id`` of the logged-in user is not a legal write:

TODO: add example

Client Error
++++++++++++

The client error in this scenario is the same as when you attempt to write
an object that is outside the App Services permissions:

TODO: verify..i assume this one is different

.. code-block:: console

   Sync: Connection[1]: Session[1]: Received: ERROR "Client attempted a
   write that is outside of permissions or query filters; it has been
   reverted" (error_code=231, try_again=true, error_action=Warning)

App Services Error
++++++++++++++++++

The error message in the App Services logs provides some additional
information to help you determine that it is a permissions issue,
and not a query subscription issue. In this example, the error message shows
that the the object does not match the user's role:

TODO: verify

.. code-block:: console

   "FlexibleSync_Item": {
       "63bdfc40f16be7b1e8c7e4b8": "write to \"63bdfc40f16be7b1e8c7e4b8\" 
       in table \"FlexibleSync_Item\" was denied by write filter in role 
       \"owner-read-write\""
   }

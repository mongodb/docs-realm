This page contains information to quickly get {+client-database+}
integrated into your Flutter app. 

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- :ref:`Installed the Flutter SDK <flutter-install>`

.. _flutter-define-object-model: 

Define Your Object Model
------------------------

Your application's **data model** defines the structure of data
stored within {+client-database+}.
You can define your application's data model via Dart
classes in your application code with
a Realm object schema. 
You then have to generate the :flutter-sdk:`RealmObject <realm/RealmObject-class.html>`
class that's used within your application.

.. seealso:: 

   :ref:`Define a Realm Object Schema - Flutter SDK <flutter-define-realm-object-schema>`

Create Data Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To define your application's data model, add a Realm model class
definition to your application code.

Some considerations when defining your Realm model class: 

- Import package at the top of your class definition file. 

- In your file, give your class a private name (starting with ``_``), 
  such as a file ``car.dart`` with a class ``_Car``.
  You generate the public RealmObject class using the command in the 
  Generate RealmObject Class section. This command 
  outputs a public class, such as ``Car``.

- Make sure to include the generated file name, such as ``part car.g.dart``,
  before the code defining your model.
  This is required to generate the RealmObject class.

.. _flutter-generate-realmobject-class:

Generate RealmObject Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now generate a RealmObject class ``Car`` from the data model class ``Car``:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Flutter
      :tabid: flutter

      .. code-block::
         
         flutter pub run realm generate

   .. tab:: Dart
      :tabid: dart

      .. code-block::
         
         dart run realm_dart generate

Running this creates a ``Car`` class in a ``car.g.dart`` file located in the directory 
where you defined the model class per the above Create Data Model section.
This ``Car`` class is public and part of the same library
as the ``_Car`` data model class.
The generated ``Car`` class is what's used throughout your application.

If you'd like to watch your data model class to generate a new ``Car`` class whenever
there's a change to ``_Car``, run: 

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Flutter
      :tabid: flutter

      .. code-block::
         
         flutter pub run realm generate --watch

   .. tab:: Dart
      :tabid: dart

      .. code-block::
         
         dart run realm_dart generate --watch

Open a Realm
------------

Use the :flutter-sdk:`Configuration <realm/Configuration-class.html>` class
to control the specifics of the {+realm+} you
would like to open, including schema.

Pass your configuration to the :flutter-sdk:`Realm constructor <realm/Realm-class.html>`
to generate an instance of that {+realm+}:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/open_realm_test.codeblock.open-realm.dart
   :language: dart

You can now use that {+realm+} instance to work with objects in the database.

Work with Realm Objects
-----------------------

Once you've opened a {+realm+}, you can create objects within it using a
:flutter-sdk:`write transaction block <realm/Realm/write.html>`.

Create Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a new ``Car``, instantiate an instance of the
``Car`` class and add it to the {+realm+} in a write transaction block:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.codeblock.create-realm-object.dart
   :language: dart

Update Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To modify a car, update its properties in a write transaction block:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.codeblock.update-realm-object.dart
   :language: dart

Query for Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Retrieve a collection of all objects of a data model in the {+realm+} with the
:flutter-sdk:`Realm.all() <realm/Realm/all.html>` method:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.codeblock.query-all-realm-objects.dart
   :language: dart

Filter a collection to retrieve a specific segment
of objects with the :flutter-sdk:`Realm.query() <realm/Realm/query.html>` method.
In the ``query()`` method's argument,
use :ref:`Realm Query Language operators<flutter-query-language>` to perform filtering.


.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.codeblock.query-realm-objects-with-filter.dart
   :language: dart

Sort the results using the :ref:`Realm Query Language <flutter-query-language>` 
SORT() operator in the ``query()`` method's argument.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.codeblock.query-realm-objects-with-sort.dart
   :language: dart

Delete Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Delete a car by calling the :flutter-sdk:`Realm.delete() <realm/Realm/delete.html>`
method in a write transaction block:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.codeblock.delete-one-realm-object.dart
   :language: dart

Delete multiple cars with the :flutter-sdk:`Realm.deleteMany() 
<realm/Realm/deleteMany.html>` method in a write transaction block. 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.codeblock.delete-many-realm-objects.dart
   :language: dart

.. TODO(DOCSP-20543): refactor everything here. this is the roughest of sketches. 
.. there's little confidence anything here is correct. the APIs for these operations 
.. haven't been finished yet. 
.. Listen for Changes to Objects
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. Listen and respond to changes to an entire {+realm+} database, a collection or a single object. 

.. To listen to an entire {+realm+}, use the `Realm.addListener(Event, ListenerCallback) <https://pub.dev/documentation/realm/latest/realm/Realm/addListener.html>`__ method. 

.. .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.codeblock.listen-to-entire-realm.dart
..    :language: dart

.. To listen to an a collection of {+realm+} objects, use the `Results<RealmObject>.addListener(ResultsListenerCallback) <https://pub.dev/documentation/realm/latest/realm/Results/addListener.html>`__ method. 

.. .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.codeblock.listen-to-collection-realm-objects.dart
..    :language: dart

.. To listen to an a single {+realm+} object, use the `RealmObject.addListener(ResultsListenerCallback) <https://pub.dev/documentation/realm/latest/realm/RealmObject/addListener.html>`__ method. 

.. .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.codeblock.listen-to-single-realm-object.dart
..    :language: dart

Close a Realm
-------------

Once you've finished working with a {+realm+}, close it to prevent memory leaks.  

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/open_realm_test.codeblock.close-realm.dart
   :language: dart

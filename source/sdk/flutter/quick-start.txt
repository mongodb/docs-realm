This page contains information to quickly get {+client-database+}
integrated into your Flutter app. 

Before you begin, ensure you have:

.. _flutter-define-object-model: 

Define Your Object Model
------------------------

Your application's **data model** defines the structure of data
stored within {+client-database+}.
You can define your application's data model via Dart
classes in your application code with
a Realm object schema. 
You then have to generate the :flutter-sdk:`RealmObject <realm/RealmObject-class.html>`
class that's used within your application.

.. seealso:: Further Reading

   :ref:`Define a Realm Object Schema - Flutter SDK <flutter-define-realm-object-schema>`

Create Data Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To define your application's data model, add a Realm model class
definition to your application code.

Some considerations when defining your Realm model class: 

- Import package at the top of your class definition file. 

- In your file, give your class a private name (starting with ``_``), 
  such as a file ``car.dart`` with a class ``_Car``.
  You generate the public RealmObject class using the command in the 
  Generate RealmObject Class section. This command 
  outputs a public class, such as ``Car``.

- Make sure to include the generated file name, such as ``part car.g.dart``,
  before the code defining your model.
  This is required to generate the RealmObject class.

Generate RealmObject Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now generate a RealmObject class ``Car`` from the data model class ``Car``:

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Flutter
      :tabid: flutter

      .. code-block::
         
         flutter pub run realm generate

   .. tab:: Dart
      :tabid: dart

      .. code-block::
         
         dart run realm_dart generate

Running this creates a ``Car`` class in a ``car.g.dart`` file located in the directory 
where you defined the model class per the above Create Data Model section.
This ``Car`` class is public and part of the same library
as the ``_Car`` data model class.
The generated ``Car`` class is what's used throughout your application.

If you'd like to watch your data model class to generate a new ``Car`` class whenever
there's a change to ``_Car``, run: 

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Flutter
      :tabid: flutter

      .. code-block::
         
         flutter pub run realm generate --watch

   .. tab:: Dart
      :tabid: dart

      .. code-block::
         
         dart run realm_dart generate --watch

Open a Realm
------------

Use the :flutter-sdk:`Configuration <realm/Configuration-class.html>` class
to control the specifics of the {+realm+} you
would like to open, including schema.

Pass your configuration to the :flutter-sdk:`Realm constructor <realm/Realm-class.html>`
to generate an instance of that {+realm+}:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/open_realm_test.codeblock.open-realm.dart
   :language: dart

You can now use that {+realm+} instance to work with objects in the database.

.. seealso:: Further Reading

   :ref:`Open and Close a Realm - Flutter SDK <flutter-open-close-realm>`

Work with Realm Objects
-----------------------

Once you've opened a {+realm+}, you can create objects within it using a
:flutter-sdk:`write transaction block <realm/Realm/write.html>`.

.. seealso:: Further Reading

   :ref:`Read and Write Data - Flutter SDK <flutter-read-write-data>`

Create Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a new ``Car``, instantiate an instance of the
``Car`` class and add it to the {+realm+} in a write transaction block:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.codeblock.create-realm-object.dart
   :language: dart

Update Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To modify a car, update its properties in a write transaction block:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.codeblock.update-realm-object.dart
   :language: dart

Query for Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Retrieve a collection of all objects of a data model in the {+realm+} with the
:flutter-sdk:`Realm.all() <realm/Realm/all.html>` method:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.codeblock.query-all-realm-objects.dart
   :language: dart

Filter a collection to retrieve a specific segment
of objects with the :flutter-sdk:`Realm.query() <realm/Realm/query.html>` method.
In the ``query()`` method's argument,
use :ref:`Realm Query Language operators<flutter-query-language>` to perform filtering.


.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.codeblock.query-realm-objects-with-filter.dart
   :language: dart

Sort the results using the :ref:`Realm Query Language <flutter-query-language>` 
SORT() operator in the ``query()`` method's argument.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.codeblock.query-realm-objects-with-sort.dart
   :language: dart

Delete Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Delete a car by calling the :flutter-sdk:`Realm.delete() <realm/Realm/delete.html>`
method in a write transaction block:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.codeblock.delete-one-realm-object.dart
   :language: dart

Delete multiple cars with the :flutter-sdk:`Realm.deleteMany() 
<realm/Realm/deleteMany.html>` method in a write transaction block. 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.codeblock.delete-many-realm-objects.dart
   :language: dart

React to Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. seealso:: Further Reading

   :ref:`React to Changes - Flutter SDK <flutter-react-to-changes>`

Listen and respond to changes to a query, a single object, or a list within an object.
The change listener is a Stream that invokes a callback function with an containing
changes since last invocation as its argument.  

To listen to a query, use  :flutter-sdk:`RealmResults.changes.listen()
<realm/RealmResultsChanges-class.html>`.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.codeblock.listen-to-query.dart
   :language: dart

To listen to a single Realm object, use :flutter-sdk:`RealmObject.changes.listen()
<realm/RealmObjectChanges-class.html>`. 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.codeblock.listen-to-realm-object.dart
   :language: dart

To listen to a list within a Realm object, use :flutter-sdk:`RealmList.changes.listen()
<realm/RealmListChanges-class.html>`.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.codeblock.listen-to-realm-list.dart
   :language: dart

You can pause and resume subscriptions as well. 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.codeblock.pause-resume-subscriptions.dart
   :language: dart

Once you've finished listening to changes, close the change listener to prevent memory leaks.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.codeblock.close-subscription.dart
   :language: dart

Close a Realm
-------------

Once you've finished working with a {+realm+}, close it to prevent memory leaks.  

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/open_realm_test.codeblock.close-realm.dart
   :language: dart

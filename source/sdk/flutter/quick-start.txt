This page contains information to quickly get {+client-database+}
integrated into your Flutter app. 

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- :ref:`Installed the Flutter SDK <flutter-install>`

.. TODO(DOCSP-20150): refactor examples as includes from the examples folder w tests

.. include:: /includes/note-flutter-local-realm-only.rst

.. TODO(DOCSP-20150): add this ref. needed in the install flutter steps

.. _flutter-define-object-model: 

Define Your Object Model
------------------------

.. TODO(DOCSP-20150): validate that this is same for new SDK 

Your application's **data model** defines the structure of data
stored within {+client-database+}.
You can define your application's data model via Dart
classes in your application code with
:ref:`Realm Object Models <create-schema-from-rom>`.

To define your application's data model, add the following class
definition to your application code:

.. code-block:: dart

   class _Car {
     @RealmProperty(primaryKey: true)
     String make;

     @RealmProperty()
     String model;

     @RealmProperty(defaultValue: "500", optional: true)
     int kilometers;
   }

.. TODO(20150):  link RealmObject to SDK reference and find out where the Car class is generated 

Now generate a RealmObject class ``Car`` from the data model class ``Car``:

.. code-block::
   
   flutter pub run build_runner build

This creates the ``Car`` class ??WHERE??. 

Open a Realm
------------

Use `Configuration <realm/Configuration-class.html>`__
to control the specifics of the {+realm+} you
would like to open, including schema.

Pass your configuration to the `Realm constructor <https://pub.dev/documentation/realm/latest/realm/Realm-class.html>`__
to generate an instance of that {+realm+}:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/open_realm_test.codeblock.open-realm.dart
   :language: dart

You can now use that {+realm+} instance to work with objects in the database.

Work with Realm Objects
-----------------------

Once you've opened a {+realm+}, you can create objects within it in a
`write transaction block <https://pub.dev/documentation/realm/latest/realm/Realm/write.html>`__.

Create Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a new ``Car``, instantiate an instance of the
``Car`` class and add it to the {+realm+} in a write transaction block:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.codeblock.create-realm-object.dart
   :language: dart

Update Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To modify a car, update its properties in a write transaction block:

.. TODO(DOCSP-20150): couldn't find anything in the current docs

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.codeblock.update-realm-object.dart
   :language: dart

Query for Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Retrieve a collection of all objects of a data model in the {+realm+} with the
`Realm.objects<RealmObject>() <https://pub.dev/documentation/realm/latest/realm/Realm/objects.html>`__
method:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.codeblock.query-all-realm-objects.dart
   :language: dart

You can also filter a collection to retrieve a more specific collection
of objects:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.codeblock.query-realm-objects-with-filter.dart
   :language: dart

.. TODO(DOCSP-20150): add something about using sort  

.. TODO(DOCSP-20150): validate this note is true for flutter. taken from the  kmm docs

.. note:: Realm Query Language

   You can find more information about string {+client-database+} queries in
   the :ref:`Node SDK Query Guide <node-client-query-engine>`.

Delete Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Delete a car by calling the `Realm.delete(RealmObject) <https://pub.dev/documentation/realm/latest/realm/Realm/delete.html>`__
method in a write transaction block:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.codeblock.delete-one-realm-object.dart
   :language: dart

Delete multiple cars with the `Realm.deleteMany(List<RealmObject>) 
<https://pub.dev/documentation/realm/latest/realm/Realm/deleteMany.html>`__ method in a write transaction block. 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.codeblock.delete-many-realm-objects.dart
   :language: dart

Listen for Changes to Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. TODO(DOCSP-20150): refactor everything here. this is the roughest of sketches. 
.. there's little confidence anything here is correct. 

Listen and respond to changes to an entire {+realm+} database, a collection or a single object. 

To listen to an entire {+realm+}, use the `Realm.addListener(Event, ListenerCallback) <https://pub.dev/documentation/realm/latest/realm/Realm/addListener.html>`__ method. 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.codeblock.listen-to-entire-realm.dart
   :language: dart

To listen to an a collection of {+realm+} objects, use the `Results<RealmObject>.addListener(ResultsListenerCallback) <https://pub.dev/documentation/realm/latest/realm/Results/addListener.html>`__ method. 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.codeblock.listen-to-collection-realm-objects.dart
   :language: dart

To listen to an a single {+realm+} object, use the `RealmObject.addListener(ResultsListenerCallback) <https://pub.dev/documentation/realm/latest/realm/RealmObject/addListener.html>`__ method. 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/flutter/quick_start_test.codeblock.listen-to-single-realm-object.dart
   :language: dart

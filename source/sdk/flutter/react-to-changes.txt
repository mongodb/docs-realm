Any modern app should be able to react when data changes,
regardless of where that change originated. When a user adds a new item to a list,
you may want to update the UI, show a notification, or log a message.
When someone updates that item, you may want to change its visual state
or fire off a network request. 
Finally, when someone deletes the item, you probably want to remove it from the UI.
Realm's notification system allows you to watch for and react to changes in your data,
independent of the writes that caused the changes.

You can subscribe to changes on the following events: 

- :ref:`Query on collection <flutter-query-change-listener>`
- :ref:`Realm object <flutter-realm-object-change-listener>`
- :ref:`List in a Realm object <flutter-realm-list-change-listener>`

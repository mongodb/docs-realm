Partition-Based Sync is a legacy mode for using Atlas Device Sync with Atlas
Device SDK. You can no longer create new Partition-Based Sync apps. All of the
Device Sync-related content on other pages in the SDK docs assume your app
uses the default Sync mode, Flexible Sync.

This page covers how to migrate a Partition-Based Sync app to a Flexible Sync
app. For apps that still use Partition-Based Sync, this page also has details
for opening a database with Partition-Based Sync.

.. tip:: C++ and Flutter SDKs Do Not Support Partition-Based Sync

   The examples on this page do not include details for C++ or Dart because
   the C++ and Flutter SDKs have never supported Partition-Based Sync.

Migrate from Partition-Based Sync to Flexible Sync
--------------------------------------------------

You can migrate your app from Partition-Based Sync mode
to Flexible Sync. Migrating is an automatic process that does not require 
any changes to your application code. Automatic migration requires 
the following minimum SDK versions:

- .NET SDK v11.1.0 and later
- Java SDK v10.16.0 and later
- Kotlin SDK v1.9.0 and later
- Node.js SDK v11.10.0 and later
- Swift SDK v10.40.0 and later

Migrating enables you to keep your existing App Services users and 
authentication configuration. Flexible Sync provides more versatile permissions
configuration options and more granular data synchronization.

For more information about how to migrate your App Services App from 
Partition-Based Sync to Flexible Sync mode, refer to :ref:`Migrate Device Sync Modes 
<realm-sync-migrate-modes>` in the App Services documentation.

Update Client Code After Migration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The automatic migration from Partition-Based Sync to Flexible Sync does not
require any changes to your client code. However, to support this 
functionality, the SDK automatically handles the differences between the two 
Sync Modes by:

- Automatically creating Sync subscriptions for each object type 
  where ``partitionKey == partitionValue``.
- Injecting a ``partitionKey`` field into every object if one does not already 
  exist. This is required for the automatic Sync subscription.

If you need to make updates to your client code after migration, consider 
updating your client codebase to remove this hidden migration functionality.

You might want update your client codebase when:

- You add a new model or change a model in your client codebase.
- You add or change functionality that involves reading or writing SDK objects.
- You want to implement more fine-grained control over what data you sync.

Make these changes to convert your Partition-Based Sync client code to use 
Flexible Sync:

For examples of Flexible Sync permissions strategies, including examples of 
how to model data for these strategies, refer to the :ref:`flexible-sync-permissions-guide`
in the App Services documentation.

Remove and Manually Create Subscriptions
````````````````````````````````````````

When you migrate from Partition-Based Sync to Flexible Sync, the SDK
automatically creates hidden Sync subscriptions for your app. The 
next time you add or change subscriptions, we recommend that you:

1. :ref:`Remove the automatically-generated subscriptions <sdks-remove-sync-subscriptions>`. 
2. :ref:`Manually add the relevant subscriptions in your client codebase <sdks-add-sync-subscriptions>`.

This enables you to see all of your subscription logic together in your 
codebase for future iteration and debugging.

For more information about the automatically-generated Sync 
subscriptions, refer to :ref:`realm-sync-migrate-client`.

.. _sdks-partition-based-sync-fundamentals:

Partition Value
---------------

For App Services Apps that use Partition-Based Sync, your client implementation must include
a partition value. This is the value of the :ref:`partition key 
<partition-key>` field in the Partition-Based Sync configuration. 

The partition value determines which data the client application can access.

You pass in the partition value when you open a synced database.

.. _sdks-pbs-open-synced-database:

Open a Synced Database with Partition-Based Sync
-----------------------------------------------

You can open a synced database for Partition-Based Sync by passing the
appropriate partition value in the Sync configuration.

When writing data to a synced database using Device Sync, you can use the 
same APIs as writing to a non-synced database. However, there are some
differences in behavior to keep in mind as you develop your application.

When you write to a synced database, your write operations must match *both*
of the following:

- **The sync subscription query.**
    - If your write operation doesn't match the query in the subscription,
      the write reverts with a non-fatal compensating write error.
- **The permissions** in your App Services App.
    - If your try to write data that doesn't match the permissions expression,
      the write reverts with a non-fatal permission denied error. In the client,
      this shows as a compensating write error. On the server, you can see more
      details about how the write was denied was by a write filter in the role.
    - To learn more about configuring permissions for your app, see
      :ref:`sync-rules` and the :ref:`flexible-sync-permissions-guide` in the
      App Services documentation.

.. warning:: Multi-Process Sync is Not Supported

   Device Sync does not currently support opening or writing to a synced 
   database from more than one process. For more information, including 
   suggested alternatives, refer to: :ref:`multiprocess-sync-not-supported`.

Determining What Data Syncs
---------------------------

The data that you can write to a synced database is the intersection of:

- Your Device Sync configuration.
- Your Atlas server-side permissions.
- The Sync subscription query that you use when you open the database.

The examples on this page use the following configurations and models:

App Services Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Device Sync is configured with the following queryable fields:

- ``_id`` (always included)
- ``complexity``
- ``ownerId``

The App Services App has permissions configured to let users read and write
only their own data:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "name": "owner-read-write", 
     "apply_when": {},
     "document_filters": {
       "read": { "ownerId": "%%user.id" },
       "write": { "ownerId": "%%user.id" }
     },
     "read": true,
     "write": true
   }

Client Data Model and Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples on this page use the following object model:

.. include:: /includes/sdk-examples/sync/write-to-synced-database-client-data-model-and-configuration-model.rst

Using that object model, the synced database configuration syncs objects that 
match the subscription query where the ``complexity`` property's value 
is less than or equal to ``4``:

.. include:: /includes/sdk-examples/sync/write-to-synced-database-client-data-model-and-configuration-subscription.rst

What Data Syncs?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The subscription query combined with the permissions mean that the synced
database only syncs objects where:

- The ``ownerId`` matches the user ID of the logged-in user (from the
  permissions)
- The ``complexity`` property's value is less than or equal to ``4`` (from the
  subscription query)

Any object in the Atlas collection where the ``ownerId`` does not match 
the user ID of the logged-in user, or the ``complexity`` property's 
value is greater than ``4``, cannot sync to this database.

Write to a Synced Database
--------------------------

Writes to synced databases may broadly fall into one of two categories: 

- **Successful writes**: The written object matches both the query subscription
  and the user's permissions. The object writes successfully to the database,
  and syncs successfully to the App Services backend and other devices.

- **Compensating writes**: When the written object does not match
  the subscription query, or where the user does not have sufficient 
  permissions to perform the write, the SDK reverts the illegal write.

.. _sdks-successful-writes:

Successful Writes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the write matches both the :ref:`permissions <permissions>` and the
:ref:`Sync subscription query <sdks-manage-sync-subscriptions>` in the client,
the SDK can successfully write the object to the synced database. This object
syncs with the App Services backend when the device has a network connection.

.. include:: /includes/sdk-examples/sync/write-to-synced-database-successful-writes.rst

.. _sdks-compensating-writes:

Compensating Writes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In some cases, a write that initially appears to succeed is actually an 
illegal write. In these cases, the object writes to the database, but when 
the database syncs to the backend, the SDK reverts the write in a non-fatal 
error operation called a compensating write. Compensating writes can occur
when:

- **Writes don't match the query subscription**: The written object matches 
  the user's permissions, but does not match the query subscription. 
- **Writes don't match permissions**: The written object matches the query
  subscription, but does not match the user's permissions.

In more detail, when you write data that is outside the bounds of a query
subscription or does not match the user's permissions, the following occurs:

#. Because the client database has no concept of "illegal" writes,
   the write initially succeeds until the SDK resolves the changeset
   with the App Services backend.
#. Upon sync, the server applies the rules and permissions.
   The server determines that the user does not have authorization to perform
   the write.
#. The server sends a revert operation, called a "compensating write", back to
   the client.
#. The client's database reverts the illegal write operation.

Any client-side writes to a given object between an illegal write to that object
and the corresponding compensating write will be lost.

In practice, this may look like an object being written to the database, and
then disappearing after the server sends the compensating write back to 
the client.

To learn more about permission denied errors, compensating write errors
and other Device Sync error types, refer to :ref:`sync-errors` in the App
Services documentation.

The :ref:`App Services logs <logs-sync>` contain more information about 
why a compensating write error occurs.

You can get additional information in the client about why a compensating 
write occurs.

.. _sdks-writes-outside-subscription:

Writes that Don't Match the Query Subscription
``````````````````````````````````````````````

You can only write objects to a synced database if they match the 
subscription query. If you perform a write that does not match the 
subscription query, the SDK initially writes the object, but then performs 
a compensating write. This is a non-fatal operation that 
reverts an illegal write that does not match the subscription query.

In practice, this may look like the write succeeding, but then the 
object "disappears" when the SDK syncs with the App Services backend and 
performs the compensating write.

If you want to write an object that does not match the query subscription,
you must open a different database where the object matches the query 
subscription. Alternately, you could write the object to a :ref:`non-synced 
database <sdks-synced-dbs-vs-non-synced-dbs>` that does not enforce 
permissions or subscription queries.

Code Example
++++++++++++

Given the configuration for the synced database above, attempting to 
write this object does not match the query subscription:

.. include:: /includes/sdk-examples/sync/write-to-synced-database-writes-dont-match-subscription-code-example.rst

App Services Error
++++++++++++++++++

The error message in the App Services logs in this scenario is:

.. code-block:: console

   "Item": {
       "63bdfc40f16be7b1e8c7e4b7": "write to \"63bdfc40f16be7b1e8c7e4b7\" 
       in table \"Item\" not allowed; object is outside of 
       the current query view"
   }

.. _sdks-writes-outside-permissions:

Writes That Don't Match Permissions
```````````````````````````````````

Attempting to write to the client can also trigger a compensating write 
error when the object does not match the user's server-side write permissions. 

On the client, this type of write behaves the same as a write that doesn't 
match the query subscription. In practice, this may look like the write 
succeeding, but then the object "disappears" when the database syncs with the 
App Services backend and performs the compensating write.

Code Example
++++++++++++

Given the permissions in the Device Sync Configuration detailed above, 
attempting to write an object where the ``ownerId`` property does not match
the ``user.id`` of the logged-in user is not a legal write:

.. include:: /includes/sdk-examples/sync/write-to-synced-database-writes-dont-match-permissions-code-example.rst

App Services Error
++++++++++++++++++

The error message in the App Services logs provides some additional 
information to help you determine that it is a permissions issue,
and not a query subscription issue. In this example, the error message shows
that the the object does not match the user's role:

.. code-block:: console

   "Item": {
       "63bdfc40f16be7b1e8c7e4b8": "write to \"63bdfc40f16be7b1e8c7e4b8\" 
       in table \"Item\" was denied by write filter in role 
       \"owner-read-write\""
   }

Group Writes for Improved Performance
-------------------------------------

.. _multiprocess-sync-not-supported:

Multi-Process Sync Not Supported
--------------------------------

If you are developing an app that may attempt to use a synced database in more
than one process, such as an Apple device application using a Share 
Extension, avoid writing to a synced database in the additional process.
Device Sync supports opening a synced database in at most one process. In
practice, this means that if your app uses a synced database in an additional
process, it may crash intermittently.

Crashes Related to Opening a Synced Database in Multiple Processes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you attempt to open a synced database in a Share Extension or other
multiple-process use case, and that database is not already open in the main
app, a write from a Share Extension may succeed. However, if the synced
database is already open in the main app, or is syncing data in the background,
you may see a crash related to ``Realm::MultiSyncAgents``. In this scenario,
you may need to restart the device.

Alternatives to Writing to a Synced Database in an Multiple Processes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you need to read from or write to a synced database in more than one
process, there are a few recommended alternatives:

- **Offline-first**: pass data on disk to or from the main process or main app
- **Always up-to-date**: communicate directly with the backing 
  Atlas collection across a network connection

Pass Data On Disk
`````````````````

If offline-first functionality is the most important consideration for your app,
you can pass data on disk to or from your main app. In an Apple ecosystem, for
example, you could copy objects to a non-synced database and read and share
it between apps in an App Group. Or you could use an on-disk queue to send the
data to or from the main app and only write to the synced database from there.
Then, regardless of the device's network connectivity, information can be
shared any time to or from the App Extension.

Communicate Directly with the Backing Atlas Collection
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````

If having the information always up-to-date across all devices is the most 
important consideration for your app, you can read or write data directly 
to or from the backing Atlas collection across the network. Depending on your 
needs, you may want to use one of these tools to communicate directly with 
Atlas:

- Query Atlas with the :ref:`the SDK MongoClient <sdks-access-mongodb>`
- Pass data to an :ref:`App Services Function <sdks-call-function>` 
- Make HTTPS calls with the :ref:`Data API <data-api>`

Then, any device that has a network connection is always getting the most 
up-to-date information, without waiting for the user to open your main app 
as in the option above.

This option does require your user's device to have a network connection 
when using the secondary process. As a fallback, you could check for a network
connection. Then, use the on-disk option above in the event that the user's 
device lacks network connectivity.

Atlas Device Sync uses subscriptions and permissions to determine what
data to sync with your client application.

After you :ref:`open a synced database <sdks-configure-and-open-synced-database>`,
you must add subscriptions before you can read to and write from the database.

You can manually add, update, and remove subscriptions to determine which 
data syncs to the client device. Or you can subscribe to queries instead of
or in addition to manually managing subscriptions.

What are Subscriptions?
-----------------------

When you configure Device Sync in Atlas, you specify which fields your 
client application can query. The SDK tracks these queries through a
**subscription**. When you subscribe to a query, the SDK automatically tracks 
changes to data matching that subscription, and uploads and downloads relevant
data.

Each subscription corresponds to a query on **queryable fields** for a 
specific object type. See :ref:`Queryable Fields <queryable-fields>` 
in the Device Sync documentation for more information.

For each query subscription, the SDK looks for data matching the query. 
Data matching the subscription, where the user has the appropriate 
permissions, syncs between clients and the backend application.

The SDK tracks these queries through a **subscription set**, which is a
collection of subscriptions. You can add, remove, and update subscriptions in
the subscription set.

You can construct subscription queries with RQL, or one of the SDK-idiomatic
query engines.

- :ref:`realm-query-language`
- :ref:`java-filter-data`
- :ref:`dotnet-linq`
- :ref:`sdks-filter-data-swift`

Subscribe to Object Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Subscription sets are based on your :ref:`data model object types <sdks-object-models>`. 
You might have multiple subscriptions if you have many types of SDK objects.
You can also have multiple subscriptions on the same object type. 

However, note the following if you use :ref:`relationships 
<sdks-relationships>` or :ref:`asymmetric objects 
<sdks-asymmetric-objects>` in your app:

Object Links
````````````

You must add both an object and its linked object to the subscription 
set to see a linked object.

If your subscription results contain an object with a property that links 
to an object not contained in the results, the link appears to be nil.
The SDK does not provide a way to distinguish whether that property's value is 
legitimately nil, or whether the object it links to exists but is out of
view of the query subscription.

Asymmetric Objects
``````````````````

If your app uses :ref:`Data Ingest <sdks-stream-data-to-atlas>` to 
unidirectionally sync **asymmetric objects**, you *cannot* create subscriptions
for those objects. If your app contains asymmetric objects and non-asymmetric
objects in the same database, you can add subscription queries for the
non-asymmetric objects.

Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~

Subscriptions work hand-in-hand with permissions to determine what data to 
Sync to your client application. The client application only sees the 
subset of data that matches your subscriptions which *also* matches the
permissions of the logged-in user. For more information about the intersection
of subscriptions and user permissions, refer to :ref:`sdks-write-synced-database`.

This page details how to manage client subscriptions for Device Sync. 
For information about setting up permissions for Device Sync, see:
:ref:`Device Sync Rules & Permissions <flexible-sync-rules-and-permissions>`.

Manage Subscriptions in Your Client App
---------------------------------------

In the client application, you add, update, and remove subscriptions to specific 
queries on the queryable fields. This determines which data syncs to the
client device.

You can:

- Add subscriptions with an optional subscription name:
  
  - You can subscribe to a database query. This automatically adds the
    subscription to the subscription set. 
  - Manually add a subscription to the subscription set with the subscribe API.
    Use this API if you need more control over subscriptions for performance
    optimization or business-logic reasons. See :ref:`Performance Considerations
    <sdks-sync-subscription-performance-considerations>` for more information.
  
- React to subscription state changes.
- Update subscriptions with new queries.
- Remove individual subscriptions or all subscriptions for an object type.

Subscriptions persist across user sessions unless you unsubscribe from them.

.. _sdks-sync-results-subscribe-api:

Subscribe to Queries
--------------------

To simplify subscription management, the SDK offers APIs to subscribe to and
unsubscribe from a query directly. These APIs abstract away the details of
manually adding and removing subscriptions. This API is not available for all
languages. If your preferred language does not provide this API, refer to
:ref:`sdks-manually-manage-subscriptions`.

.. important:: The Subscribe to Queries API is in Preview

   The APIs described here are currently in Preview. These APIs may be subject
   to change in the future.

.. _sdks-subscribe-to-query:

Subscribe to a Query
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With an :ref:`authenticated user <sdks-authenticate-users>` and a
:ref:`Sync configuration <sdks-configure-and-open-synced-database>`, you can
open a synced database and query for the objects you want to read and write.
You can subscribe to the query to create a subscription for objects matching
the query.

This creates an unnamed subscription and adds it to the subscription set,
similar to :ref:`manually creating a subscription
<sdks-sync-subscriptions-add-subscription>`.

Subscriptions persist across user sessions unless you unsubscribe from them.

.. tip::

   If your app works with multiple subscriptions, or if you want to update
   a subscription, you should add a name when you subscribe to a query. For
   details, refer to the :ref:`sdks-subscribe-to-query-with-name` section on
   this page.

.. _sdks-wait-for-query-subscription-to-sync:

Wait for a Query Subscription to Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you subscribe to a query, that query's results do not contain objects
until the subscription syncs with Atlas.

If your app creates objects, you may not need to download synced data before
the user works with it. However, if your app requires data from Atlas before
the user can work with your app, you can specify that the SDK should wait for
the subscription query data to sync before proceeding.

.. _sdks-unsubscribe-from-query:

Unsubscribe from a Query
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can unsubscribe from a query that you have previously subscribed to.
Unsubscribing removes the suscription from the subscription set, similar to
:ref:`manually removing a subscription <sdks-remove-query-by-name>`.

A query results set may still contain objects after calling the unsubscribe
method if the subscription set contains another overlapping subscription.

The unsubscribe method returns before objects matching the removed subscription
are deleted from the database. Sync continues in the background based on the
new set of subscriptions. There is no API to wait for the unsubscribe method
to sync with the server.

.. _sdks-manually-manage-subscriptions:

Manually Manage Subscriptions
-----------------------------

As an alternative to the subscribe to a query API, you can manually manage the
subscriptions in a subscription set.

You can:

- Add subscriptions
- React to subscription state change
- Update subscriptions with new queries
- Remove individual subscriptions or all subscriptions for an object type

Data matching the subscription, where the user has the appropriate 
permissions, syncs between devices and Atlas.

You can specify an optional string name for your subscription.

When you create a subscription, the SDK looks for data matching a query on a
specific object type. You can have multiple subscription sets on different 
object types. You can also have multiple queries on the same object type.

.. _sdks-sync-subscriptions-add-subscription:

Add a Subscription
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add a subscription in a subscriptions update block. You append each
new subscription to the client's SDK subscriptions.

Subscriptions persist across user sessions unless you remove them from the
subscription set.

If your app is adding subscriptions for the first time, some SDK languages
provide a special parameter to set initial subscriptions or recalculate
initial subscriptions on app launch. For details, skip to the
:ref:`set initial subscriptions <sdks-set-initial-subscriptions>` on this page.

.. tip::

   If your app works with multiple subscriptions, or if you want to update
   a subscription, you should add a name when you subscribe to a query. For
   details, refer to the :ref:`sdks-add-named-subscription` section on
   this page.

can do this by batching additions and changes to the subscription set.

.. _sdks-wait-for-subscription-changes-to-sync:

Wait for Subscription Changes to Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Updating the subscription set on the device is only one component 
of changing a subscription. After the client app subscription change, the SDK 
synchronizes with the server to resolve any updates to the data due to 
the subscription change. This could mean adding or removing data from the 
synced database.

**Adding New Subscriptions**

If your app creates objects, you may not need to download synced data before
the user works with it. However, if your app requires data from Atlas before
the user can work with your app, you can specify that the SDK should wait for
the subscription changes to sync before proceeding.

**Updating Existing Subscriptions**

When you update an existing subscription, this could mean adding new data or
removing data from the synced database. If this involves things like changing
user permissions to add or remove data, or if your app otherwise makes these
changes visible to users in the UI, you may want to wait for subscription
changes to update before proceeding with app execution. Otherwise, the changes
may appear to the user as unexpected changes to the data set later during
"normal" app execution.

.. note:: Subscription State "Complete"

   The subscription set state "complete" does not mean "sync is done" or "all
   documents have been synced". "Complete" means the following two things have
   happened:
   
   - The subscription has become the active subscription set that is currently
     being synchronized with the server.
   - The documents that matched the subscription *at the time the subscription
     was sent to the server* are now on the device. Note that this does
     not necessarily include all documents that currently match the
     subscription.
  
   The SDK does not provide a way to check whether all documents that
   match a subscription have synced to the device.

.. _sdks-change-subscription-queries:

Change Subscription Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can change the queries in a subscription set. You might want to do this
when business logic dictates syncing a different subset of objects, such as
when a user unlocks new features in an app.

- Change a named query
- Change an unnamed query

When you change a query, consider how it interacts with any other queries that
may be in the subscription set. You may need to
:ref:`add <sdks-sync-subscriptions-add-subscription>` or
:ref:`remove <sdks-remove-subscriptions>` other subscriptions, such as:

- Adding a new subscription when a change to a query introduces new linked objects
- Removing a subscription when an overlapping query inadvertently exposes
  objects you don't want to sync

Remove Subscriptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To remove subscriptions, you can:

- Remove a specific subscription
  - Remove a named subscription
  - Remove an unnamed subscription
  - Remove a subscription by reference

- Remove all subscriptions for a specific object type
- Remove all unnamed subscriptions
- Remove all subscriptions

When you remove a subscription query, the SDK asynchronously removes the
synced data that matched the query from the client device.

.. _sdks-sync-subscription-performance-considerations:

Performance Considerations
--------------------------

API Efficiency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adding several subscriptions with the ``.subscribe()`` and ``.unsubscribe()``
APIs described in the :ref:`sdks-sync-results-subscribe-api` section
is less efficient than performing batch updates when you manually 
manage subscriptions. On every ``.subscribe()``, the Swift SDK opens a new
update block. For better performance adding multiple 
subscriptions, use the ``subscriptions.update`` API described in the 
:ref:`sdks-manually-manage-subscriptions` section.

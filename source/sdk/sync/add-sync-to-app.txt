This page contains information about Device Sync, its basic concepts, 
and how to add Sync to a client app using Atlas Device SDK. Once you have
added Sync to your app, you can access a synced database from the client. 

Already familiar with Device Sync? Skip ahead to the 
:ref:`sdks-add-sync-to-app-enable-sync-in-atlas` section 
to get started.

Device Sync
-----------

**Device Sync** synchronizes data between client devices and Atlas. 
Data is persisted on a device, even when offline. When the device has a 
network connection, Device Sync uploads and downloads
data in the background and manages conflict resolution. 

The data that syncs between your client app and Atlas is determined by 
a user's permissions to access eligible data. Eligible data is the
intersection of:

- Data model: your data type information
- Subscription queries: the conditions that define what data to store
- Permissions: the role-based permissions required to interact with data 
  that meets the specified conditions

For a detailed explanation of Device Sync, refer to 
:ref:`realm-sync-get-started` in the Atlas App Services
documentation.

Data Model 
~~~~~~~~~~

The Device Sync data model defines the object types that you can sync.
Every SDK object you sync requires a client-side and server-side schema: 

- **Object schema**: the object schema in your client app that defines your 
  data in your preferred programming language.
- **App Services schema**: the schema in Atlas App Services that defines
  your data in BSON. 

Both schemas must be consistent with each other to sync data. 

You can define the Device Sync data model in a client app first or 
in Atlas first:

- To define your data model through your client app, you first
  :ref:`define an object model <sdks-object-models>` 
  directly in your client app code. Then, you can use **Development Mode** to 
  generate a matching App Services schema automatically. Development Mode
  is a configuration setting that allows Device Sync 
  to infer and update schemas based on client-side data models when you 
  sync data from the client. The
  :ref:`sdks-add-sync-to-app-enable-sync-in-app-services` section describes
  how to enable Device Sync with Development Mode in your client app. 

- If you already have data in Atlas and would
  prefer to define your data model through Atlas first, refer to 
  :ref:`sync-data-in-atlas-with-client` in the App Services documentation.

.. note:: Data Model Mapping with Device Sync

  To learn more about how data maps between the client and Atlas, refer to
  :ref:`sdks-model-data-device-sync`.

Subscriptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **subscription** is a client-side query to objects in your data model. 
Device Sync only syncs objects that match the query. You can define multiple
queries in your client app. You must define at least one query for 
each object type in your data model.

Device Sync ensures that your client-side queries are consistent with
your App Services schema through **queryable fields**. These are the 
fields from your data model that can be used in a subscription query. You 
cannot define a subscription using a field that isn't in your queryable
fields.

When Development Mode is enabled, Device Sync automatically
adds the fields that appear in your client queries as queryable fields.
You can also manually add and remove queryable fields through the 
Atlas UI. For more information, refer to :ref:`queryable-fields` 
in the App Services documentation.

User Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

App Services uses **role-based permissions** to control the data that users 
can read and write: 

- When a user has read permissions, Device Sync downloads data matching the
  subscription query to the client.
- When a user has write permissions, Device Sync permits writes to the synced
  data and uploads locally-written data to the backend.

You can define and manage roles in the Atlas UI. When you enable Sync, 
you select a default role, which you can modify later. For more information,
refer to :ref:`flexible-sync-roles` in the App Services 
documentation.

Prerequisites
-------------

You can add Device Sync to an app in several ways, depending on the state 
of your app and your data. This guide describes how to add Sync to an 
existing client app using Development Mode. This guide assumes that your 
app already uses Atlas Device SDK and that you have already defined a data
model in your client code. 

Because Device Sync connects your client app to the Atlas backend 
through an Atlas App Services App, you need the following before you 
can get started: 

#. An Atlas App Services App with authentication enabled. To learn how, 
   refer to :ref:`create-a-realm-app` in the App Services documentation.
#. Confirm that your app can connect to Atlas. To learn how, refer to
   :ref:`sdks-connect-to-atlas`.

.. _sdks-add-sync-to-app-enable-sync-in-atlas:

Enable Device Sync in Atlas
---------------------------

You must first enable Device Sync in Atlas before you can add Sync to your
client app. 

To enable Device Sync in your App, complete the steps outlined in 
:ref:`Configure and Enable Atlas Device Sync <enable-flexible-sync>` 
procedure in the App Services documentation.

During this process, you can choose whether to enable Development 
Mode and you can select a default role for your app users. 
For more information on the available settings, refer to 
:ref:`sync-settings` in the App Services documentation.

.. tip:: 

   We recommend enabling Development Mode when you first enable 
   Sync, and then disabling it before your app goes to production. 
   For more information, refer to :ref:`development-mode` in the 
   App Services documentation.

For our example app, we enable Device Sync with Development Mode, and 
then add the "User can read and write all data" default role. This means that,
for an authorized user with a network connection, Device Sync downloads
eligible data to the client *and* Atlas permits writes to the client and then
syncs them the backend. To learn more about what happens when an authorized
user does not have a network connection, refer to
:ref:`sdks-write-synced-database`.

Add Sync to Your Client App
---------------------------

After you've configured and enabled Sync in Atlas, you can add Sync to your
client app. 

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Connect to Atlas

      Pass your App ID to an ``App`` client to initialize the App. To get 
      your App ID from the App Services UI, refer to 
      :ref:`Find Your App ID <find-your-app-id>` in the 
      App Services documentation.

      For our example app, we pass our App ID to initialize an ``App`` with 
      default configuration values:

      .. include:: /includes/sdk-examples/sync/add-sync-to-app-connect-to-atlas.rst

      For more information on accessing and configuring the App client, refer 
      to :ref:`sdks-connect-to-atlas`.

   .. step:: Authenticate a User

      Authenticate a user in your client app using an 
      authentication provider that you have enabled. 
      
      For our example app, we log in a user using anonymous authentication: 

      .. include:: /includes/sdk-examples/sync/add-sync-to-app-authenticate-user.rst

      For more information on authenticating users in your app, refer to
      :ref:`sdks-authenticate-users`.

   .. step:: Define the Sync Configuration

            :tabid: csharp

            .. include:: /includes/api-details/csharp/sync/add-sync-to-app-define-sync-configuration-description.rst
            
         .. tab::
            :tabid: dart

      .. include:: /includes/sdk-examples/sync/add-sync-to-app-define-sync-configuration.rst

      .. important:: Object Types in Your Schema

         The Sync configuration schema *must* include all object types that
         you want to work with in your synced database. If you try to reference 
         or write an object of an object type that isn't in your schema, 
         the SDK returns a schema validation error.

   .. step:: Open the Synced Database

      Use the defined configuration to 
      :ref:`open the synced database <sdks-configure-and-open-synced-database>`.
      When the database is opened successfully, the initial subscription
      query determines which data to sync to the client.
      If Development Mode is enabled, Device Sync automatically 
      adds any queryable fields based on the query defined in 
      your schema.

Use the Synced Database
-----------------------

Now that you've opened the synced database, you can work with your 
data in the database. While you work with data on the device, a 
background thread efficiently integrates, uploads, and downloads changesets. 

The syntax to perform read and write operations and watch for changes is
identical to the syntax for non-synced databases. However, there are additional
considerations when writing data to a synced database. For more information,
refer to :ref:`sdks-write-synced-database`.

.. include:: /includes/sdk-examples/sync/add-sync-to-app-use-synced-database.rst

If our write operation didn't match the query *or* the current user didn't 
have the requisite permissions, then the SDK reverts the write with a
non-fatal error operation called a :ref:`compensating write <sdks-compensating-writes>`.

.. important:: When Using Sync, Avoid Synchronous Writes on the Main Thread

   The fact that the SDK performs sync integrations on a background thread
   means that if you write to your database synchronously on the main thread,
   there's a small chance your UI could appear to hang as it waits for the
   background sync thread to finish a write transaction. Therefore, it's a
   best practice :ref:`not to write on the main thread when using Device Sync
   <sdks-threading-three-rules>`. Instead, use your language's implementation
   of the asynchronous write API.

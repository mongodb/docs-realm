Opening a synced database starts a Sync session for that database.
Atlas Device SDK provides methods to:

- Check the network connection state.
- Manually pause and resume a Sync session.
- Wait for changes to upload or download.
- Check upload or download progress.
- Manually reconnect Sync sessions after a device has been offline.

You can also define the Sync connection behavior. App Services defaults to 
sharing a single connection to the server for all opened synced databases. 
The connection to the server is independent of the Sync session, and is based
on the App Services user.

You can change the Sync connection behavior from the :ref:`App client
configuration <sdks-connect-to-atlas>`.

Check the Network Connection
----------------------------

The SDK's *offline-first* design means that you generally don't need to check
the current network connection state. However, the SDK provides a connection
state property if your app calls for some indication of connection state.

Pause or Resume a Sync Session
------------------------------

You can pause and resume the sync session on the database. Pausing a sync
session only suspends that database's sync session. If you have more than one
open database, and you have enabled multiple sync sessions, pausing one sync
session does not affect the sync sessions for other databases.

When to Pause a Sync Session
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For most applications, there is no need to manually pause and resume a sync 
session. However, there are a few circumstances under which you may want to 
pause or suspend a sync session:

- You only want to sync after the user takes a specific action
- You only want to sync during a certain time of the day
- You don't want to attempt to sync when there is poor network connectivity
- You want to force the SDK to re-evaluate the user's permissions after making
  a permissions-related change

In the case of poor network connectivity, continually trying to establish 
a network connection can drain the user's device battery.

The case of explicitly forcing a sync session to connect is most commonly 
related to being offline for some time. The sync client attempts to 
connect, and upon failure, goes into exponential backoff. After being offline 
for a long time, the client may not immediately reconnect. Pausing and 
resuming the sync session explicitly forces the connection.

When you do pause a sync session, keep these things in mind:

- If the client may be offline longer than the :ref:`client maximum offline 
  time <client-maximum-offline-time>`, the client will be unable to resume
  syncing and must perform a :ref:`client reset <client-resets>`.
- Pausing a sync session pauses it in both directions. Changes that your app 
  makes on the device do not sync with the backend, *and* changes to the
  data in the backend or on other devices do not sync to the device. There
  is no way to pause only uploads or pause only downloads.
- Do not pause a sync session if you want a client to permanently stop 
  syncing with the backend. To permanently stop syncing, 
  copy the contents of the synced database into a non-synced 
  database, and use the non-synced database in the client.

*Do not* pause sync to stop syncing for indefinite time periods or time 
ranges in months and years. The functionality is not designed or tested 
for these use cases. You could encounter a range of issues when using it 
this way.

.. _sdks-sync-session-wait-for-changes:

Wait for Changes to Upload or Download
--------------------------------------

You can wait for changes to upload or download. You might want to wait for
changes to upload or download before you close a synced database, pause a
Sync session, or change Sync subscriptions.

.. _sdks-reconnect-sync-sessions:

Manually Reconnect All Sync Sessions
------------------------------------

The SDK automatically detects when a device regains connectivity after being 
offline and attempts to reconnect using an incremental backoff strategy.
For example, on Apple platforms, the SDK listens for network change
notifications and automatically triggers a reconnect immediately after
receiving one.

You can choose to manually trigger a reconnect attempt with with the reconnect
method instead of waiting for the duration of the incremental backoff. This is 
useful if you have a more accurate understanding of the network conditions
and don't want to rely on the SDK's automatic reconnect detection.

When you call this method, the SDK forces all sync sessions to *attempt* to 
reconnect immediately. This resets any timers used for incremental 
backoff. 

Calling this method does not guarantee the device can reconnect. If the SDK
gets a fatal error, or if the device is already connected or is trying to
connect, calling this method has no effect.

.. important:: Cannot Reconnect Within Socket Read Timeout Duration
   
   The SDK has an internal default socket read timeout of 2 minutes. The 
   SDK times out if a read operation does not receive any data within a
   2-minute window. If you call the reconnect method within that window, the 
   SDK does *not* attempt to reconnect.

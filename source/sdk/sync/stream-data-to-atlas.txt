If you have a mobile or client application that produces a large volume of data 
you'd like to stream to MongoDB Atlas, you can sync data unidirectionally using 
Device Sync. We call the feature that enables this unidirectional sync **Data Ingest**.

You can use :ref:`Data Ingest <optimize-data-ingest>` to stream 
data from the client application to a Device Sync-enabled Atlas App Services
App.

You might want to sync data unidirectionally in IoT applications, such as
a weather sensor sending data to the cloud. Data Ingest is also useful 
for writing other types of immutable data where you do not require conflict 
resolution, such as creating invoices from a retail app or logging application 
events.

Data Ingest is optimized to provide performance improvements for heavy
client-side *insert-only* workloads.

      .. include:: /includes/sdk-examples/sync/stream-data-define-asymmetric-object.rst

   .. step:: Connect and Authenticate with an App Services App

      To stream data from the client to your backend App, you must 
      :ref:`connect to Atlas <sdks-connect-to-atlas>` and
      :ref:`authenticate a user <sdks-authenticate-users>`.

      .. include:: /includes/sdk-examples/sync/stream-data-connect-and-authenticate.rst

   .. step:: Open a Synced Database

      After you have an authenticated user, open a :ref:`synced database
      <sdks-configure-and-open-synced-database>`.

      Unlike bi-directional Device Sync, Data Ingest does not use a 
      :ref:`Sync subscription <sdks-manage-sync-subscriptions>`.

      You cannot read, query, or delete an asymmetric object from a
      database, so asymmetric objects are incompatible with bi-directional
      Device Sync or non-synced database use.

      You cannot read these objects. Once created, they sync to the App 
      Services backend and the linked Atlas database.
      
      Atlas Device Sync completely manages the lifecycle of this data. 
      It is maintained on the device until Data Ingest synchronization is 
      complete, and then removed from the device.

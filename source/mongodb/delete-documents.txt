The code snippets on this page demonstrate how to delete documents that
are stored in a MongoDB collection. Delete operations use a query filter
to specify which documents to delete.

Methods
-------

Delete a Single Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can delete a single document from a collection using the
:method:`collection.deleteOne()` action.

The following snippet deletes one document in the ``items`` collection
that has a ``name`` value of ``legos``:

.. tab-bar:: tabs-realm-sdks
   :tab-ids: functions, javascript, android, ios

.. include:: /mongodb/crud-snippets/deleteOne/all.rst

Delete One or More Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can delete multiple items from a collection using the
:method:`collection.deleteMany()` action.

The following snippet deletes all documents in the ``items`` collection
that do not have any ``reviews``:

.. tab-bar:: tabs-realm-sdks
   :tab-ids: functions, javascript, android, ios

.. include:: /mongodb/crud-snippets/deleteMany/all.rst

Overview
--------

{+service+} allows you to watch a collection and receive client-side
:ref:`database events <database-events>` whenever documents in the
collection are inserted or modified. This enables you to develop real-time
and collaborative applications without the overhead and complexity of
alternatives such as long polling.

{+service-short+} uses MongoDB :ref:`change streams <changeStreams>` on watched
collections to listen for changes and broadcast them to any client
applications that are watching documents in the collection at the time
of the event. {+service-short+} supports watching any change on a collection
and watching changes that match a certain filter.

.. admonition:: Change Stream Limitations
   :class: important

   {+service-short+} opens a single MongoDB :ref:`change stream <changeStreams>`
   for each watched collection and limits the total number of open
   change streams on each linked cluster across all {+service-short+} apps based on
   the cluster's size. See :ref:`change stream limitations
   <mongodb-service-limitations-change-streams>` for more information.

Examples
--------

For code examples of watching collections, refer to the client SDKs:

.. tabs-realm-sdks::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: android

      To watch for changes to a collection from the Android Client SDK, see the
      :ref:`Android SDK documentation for change streams <android-mongodb-watch>`.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: web

      To watch for changes to a collection from the Web Client SDK, see the
      :ref:`Web SDK documentation for change streams <web-mongodb-watch>`.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: node
      
      To watch for changes to a collection from the Node Client SDK, see the
      :ref:`Node SDK documentation for change streams <node-mongodb-watch>`.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: react-native

      To watch for changes to a collection from the React Native Client SDK, see the
      :ref:`React Native SDK documentation for change streams <react-native-mongodb-watch>`.

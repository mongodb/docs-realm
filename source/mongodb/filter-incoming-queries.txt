Overview
--------

You can define filters on incoming queries that Realm evaluates and
applies before its initial query to your MongoDB cluster. Adding a
filter to a collection allows you to control the shape of queried
documents using projection filters and can improve query performance by
reducing the number of documents for which Realm needs to evaluate a
role.

Every filter consists of an :guilabel:`Apply When` :doc:`JSON expression
</services/json-expressions>` and a :guilabel:`Filter Query` document.
When Realm receives an incoming MongoDB query, it evaluates the
:guilabel:`Apply When` expression of all filters on the collection and
merges the :guilabel:`Filter Query` document into the incoming query.

This guide walks through creating one or more query filters for a
collection.

.. note::

   This guide requires a :doc:`linked MongoDB Atlas cluster
   </mongodb/link-a-cluster>`.

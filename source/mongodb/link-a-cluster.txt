Overview
--------

You can use Realm to work with any MongoDB Atlas cluster associated
with the same Atlas project as your Realm application. To connect to a
cluster through Realm, you must first link it to a new MongoDB service
in your application.

You can create a MongoDB service and link a cluster to your Realm
application through the Realm UI or with an :doc:`import/export
</deploy/deploy-changes-with-realm-cli>` configuration directory.
Select the tab below that corresponds to the method you want to use.

Procedure
---------

   tabs:
     - id: stitch-ui
       content: |
         .. include:: /includes/steps/link-a-cluster-realm-ui.rst

     - id: import-export
       content: |
         .. include:: /includes/steps/link-a-cluster-import-export.rst

Realm will immediately begin the process of linking to the cluster,
which could take up to five minutes. Once Realm is finished linking to
the cluster, you can start reading and writing data. The following pages
demonstrate how to start working with your linked cluster.

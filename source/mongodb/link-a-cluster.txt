Overview
--------

You can use {+service+} to work with any `{+atlas+}
<https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?tck=docs_realm>`_ cluster associated
with the same Atlas project as your {+app+}. To connect to a
cluster through {+service-short+}, you must first link it to a new MongoDB service
in your application.

You can create a MongoDB service and link a cluster to your {+app+}
through the {+ui+} or with an :doc:`import/export
</deploy/deploy-cli>` configuration directory.
Select the tab below that corresponds to the method you want to use.

Procedure

   tabs:
     - id: ui
       content: |
         .. include:: /includes/steps/link-a-cluster-realm-ui.rst

     - id: cli
       content: |
         .. include:: /includes/steps/link-a-cluster-import-export.rst

{+service-short+} will immediately begin the process of linking to the cluster,
which could take up to five minutes. Once {+service-short+} is finished linking to
the cluster, you can start reading and writing data. The following pages
demonstrate how to start working with your linked cluster.

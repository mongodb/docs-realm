Overview
--------

You can use Realm to work with any MongoDB Atlas cluster associated
with the same Atlas project as your Realm application. To connect to a
cluster through Realm, you must first link it to a new MongoDB service
in your application.

You can create a MongoDB service and link a cluster to your Realm
application through the Realm UI or with an :doc:`import/export
</deploy/deploy-changes-with-realm-cli>` configuration directory.
Select the tab below that corresponds to the method you want to use.

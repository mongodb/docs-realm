.. _mongodb-service-limitations-overview:

Overview
--------

You can access most of the CRUD and Aggregation functionality of MongoDB
version 3.6 with the :doc:`MongoDB service </mongodb>`; however, {+service+}
does not support all operations and features available in standard tools
and clients. This page provides a high-level overview of MongoDB feature
availability in {+service-short+}. For a list of specific MongoDB operations that
are available when you connect to MongoDB through {+service-short+}, see
:ref:`the CRUD & Aggregation API reference
<mongodb-crud-and-aggregation-apis>`.

.. _mongodb-service-limitations-query-results:

Query Results
-------------

MongoDB queries executed through {+service-short+} can return a maximum of 50,000
documents. If you need to return more documents, consider paginating
your query.

.. _mongodb-service-limitations-query-options:

Query Options
-------------

{+service-short+} supports all query options in :ref:`system functions
<function-system-user>` except ``distinct()``. {+service-short+} does
not support certain options for CRUD operations run from
:ref:`user functions <function-active-user>`.
For a list of specific options that are available when you connect to
MongoDB through {+service-short+}, see :ref:`Query Options
<mongodb-crud-and-aggregation-apis-query-options>`.

.. _mongodb-service-limitations-aggregation:

Aggregation
-----------

{+service-short+} supports all :manual:`aggregation pipeline
stages </reference/operator/aggregation-pipeline/>` in
:ref:`system functions <function-system-user>` except for ``$currentOp``
and ``$indexStats``.

In :ref:`user functions <function-active-user>`, supported
:doc:`aggregation pipeline stages </mongodb/run-aggregation-pipelines>` are
reduced for security reasons.

For a list of pipeline stages that are available and their allowed function
context, see :ref:`Aggregation <mongodb-crud-and-aggregation-apis-aggregation>`.

.. _mongodb-service-limitations-database-commmands:

Database Commands
-----------------

{+service-short+} does not support any :manual:`database commands
</reference/command>` in the Client SDKs or :doc:`Functions
</functions>`. You can, however, call a limited subset of database
commands when when connected to a MongoDB cluster over the :doc:`{+service-short+}
wire protocol </mongodb/connect-over-the-wire-protocol>`. For a list of
wire protocol supported commands, see
:ref:`Database Commands
<mongodb-crud-and-aggregation-apis-database-commands>`.

.. _mongodb-service-limitations-change-streams:

Change Streams
--------------

{+service-short+} limits the total number of change streams open against a given
cluster across all {+app+}s based on the cluster's size.
It also limits the number of client applications that can concurrently
listen for changes using :doc:`Watch </mongodb/watch-documents>` and :ref:`Mobile
Sync <sync-overview>`. The following table lists the limitations for
each cluster size:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 30 30

   * - Cluster Size
     - Maximum Number of Change Streams
     - Maximum Number of Concurrent Listening Clients

   * - Free Tier (``M0``)
     - 5
     - 250

   * - Shared Clusters (``M2``/``M5``)
     - 10
     - 500

   * - Small, Dedicated Clusters (``M10``/``M20``)
     - 100
     - 1000

   * - Standard Clusters (``M30``/``M40``)
     - 1000
     - 10000

   * - Standard Clusters (``M50`` - ``M90``)
     - 1000
     - 50000

   * - High-Power Clusters (``M100+``)
     - 1000
     - 100000 (Contact Support for Additional Usage)

.. note::

   {+service-short+} opens a single change stream on each collection that is
   associated with a :doc:`Database Trigger </triggers>`,
   :ref:`Collection Sync <sync-overview>`, or :doc:`Watch operation
   </mongodb/watch-documents>`.

.. admonition:: Usage Recommendation
   :class: important

   To minimize the number of concurrent listening clients and open
   change streams:

   - Start Watch and Sync operations only when necessary. Close any open
     Watch and Sync streams immediately when they're no longer
     necessary.

   - Avoid data models that require you to Watch or Sync an unbounded
     number of collections.


Static Hosting
--------------
{+service-short+} enforces a 25MB maximum file size constraint on
:doc:`static hosting </hosting/>`.

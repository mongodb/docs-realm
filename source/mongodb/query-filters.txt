Overview
--------

A MongoDB **query filter** conditionally applies additional query
predicates and projections to an incoming query before Realm runs it.
Filters are useful for improving the performance of queries on
collections that have many documents or :doc:`roles
</mongodb/query-roles>` that use complex :guilabel:`Apply When`
expressions.

You can add filters to a collection to remove documents that you know
are not relevant to incoming queries before Realm evaluates any roles.
This can help to reduce the amount of computation that Realm needs to
perform for a request. Filters can take advantage of indexes in a linked
MongoDB cluster, so filtering out a document is generally faster than
waiting for Realm to evaluate a role for it.

Filter Application Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When Realm receives a query request, it determines if any filters
associated with the collection apply to the request and adds those to
the query. To assign filters to a query, Realm evaluates the
:guilabel:`Apply When` :doc:`JSON expression </services/json-expressions>`
that you defined for each filter. If a filter's :guilabel:`Apply When`
evaluates to ``true``, Realm merges the :guilabel:`Filter Query` into
the incoming query document.

.. example::

   A collection contains several million documents and has one role with
   the following :guilabel:`Apply When` expression:

   .. code-block:: json

      { "owner_id": "%%user.id" }

   If no filter is applied, Realm will evaluate a role for each
   document that the query matches. We know that Realm will withhold
   any document that does not have the user's id as the value of the
   ``owner_id`` field, so we save time and compute resources by applying
   an additional query predicate that excludes those documents before
   Realm evaluates any roles:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1

      * - :guilabel:`Apply When`
        - :guilabel:`Query`
        - :guilabel:`Projection`

      * - ``{ "%%true": true }``
        - ``{ "owner_id": "%%user.id" }``
        - ``{}``

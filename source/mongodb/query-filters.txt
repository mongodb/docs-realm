Overview
--------

A MongoDB **query filter** conditionally applies additional query
predicates and projections to an incoming query before {+backend+} runs
the query. Filters are useful for improving the performance of queries
on collections that have many documents or :doc:`roles
</mongodb/query-roles>` that use complex :guilabel:`Apply When`
expressions.

You can add filters to a collection to remove documents that you know
are not relevant to incoming queries before {+backend+} evaluates any
roles. This can help to reduce the amount of computation that
{+backend+} needs to perform for a request. Filters can take advantage
of indexes in a :term:`linked {+atlas+} cluster <linked cluster>`, so
filtering out a document is generally faster than waiting for
{+backend+} to evaluate a role for it.

Filter Application Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When {+backend+} receives a query request, it determines if any filters
associated with the collection apply to the request and adds those to
the query. To assign filters to a query, {+backend+} evaluates the
:guilabel:`Apply When` :doc:`JSON expression </services/json-expressions>`
that you defined for each filter. If a filter's :guilabel:`Apply When`
evaluates to ``true``, {+backend+} merges the :guilabel:`Filter Query`
into the incoming query document.

.. example::

   A collection contains several million documents and has one role with
   the following :guilabel:`Apply When` expression:

   .. code-block:: json

      { "owner_id": "%%user.id" }

   If no filter is applied, {+backend+} will evaluate a role for each
   document that the query matches. We know that {+backend+} will withhold
   any document that does not have the user's id as the value of the
   ``owner_id`` field, so we save time and compute resources by applying
   an additional query predicate that excludes those documents before
   {+backend+} evaluates any roles:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1

      * - :guilabel:`Apply When`
        - :guilabel:`Query`
        - :guilabel:`Projection`

      * - ``{ "%%true": true }``
        - ``{ "owner_id": "%%user.id" }``
        - ``{}``

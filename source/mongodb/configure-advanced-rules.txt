Overview
--------

You can manually configure all aspects of a collection's rules by
editing the underlying configuration document directly through the
{+ui+}. :guilabel:`Advanced Mode` refers to editing rules in this manner. 

When To Use Advanced Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default or "Basic Mode" rules editor in the {+ui+} covers the
majority of use cases for collection rules. However, there are times
when you need more fine-grained control than the UI interface provides.
Consider using Advanced Mode if you need to do the following:

- Configure a role that can :ref:`only insert documents
  <role-template-insert-only>`.

- Define field-level read or write permissions for a :ref:`field in an
  embedded document <role-template-embedded-documents>`.

- Determine field-level write permissions dynamically using a :doc:`JSON
  expression </services/json-expressions>`.

.. warning::

   Once you convert a collection's rules to Advanced Mode, you may not
   be able to switch back to editing that collection's rules through the
   Basic Mode interface.

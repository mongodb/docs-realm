Overview
--------

You can configure :ref:`database triggers <database-trigger>` to include a
**document preimage** in their change events. A preimage is a snapshot of a
modified document from just *before* the modification was applied.

To support document preimages, Realm includes additional information in the
linked cluster's :manual:`oplog </core/replica-set-oplog>`. This adds a small
amount of storage overhead to each operation on the collection and may cause
performance issues for collections with a high write throughput. Once you have
enabled preimages for a collection, any trigger on the collection may enable
document preimages with no additional overhead.

.. tip::

   For information on how to enable document preimages for a specific trigger,
   see :ref:`Create a Database Trigger <create-a-database-trigger>`.

View Preimage-Enabled Collections
---------------------------------

To see a list of collections that are configured to store document preimages in
their oplog, navigate to the :guilabel:`Linked Data Source` configuration screen
and find the :guilabel:`Preimage Preferences by Collection` table.

The table lists every collection that stores preimages in the oplog. This
includes all collections in the linked cluster, even if no triggers currently
use the preimages for a collection or if the triggers are in a different Realm
app.

Disable Preimages for a Collection
----------------------------------

You can disable collection-level preimages in the {+ui+}. Once disabled, the
oplog no longer includes preimages for documents in the collection. To disable
preimages for a collection:

1. (Optional) Disable document preimages for all triggers on the collection.
   When collection-level preimages are disabled, triggers on the collection that
   still have preimages enabled (including triggers in other Realm apps) will
   continue to execute but will not include the ``fullDocumentBeforeChange``
   field in change events.

2. Disable sync, if the collection is part of a :ref:`synced cluster <sync>`.

3. On the linked cluster configuration screen, find the collection in the
   :guilabel:`Preimage Preferences by Collection` table and then click
   :guilabel:`Disable`.

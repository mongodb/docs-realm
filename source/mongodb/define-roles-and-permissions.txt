Overview
--------

The :ref:`MongoDB service <mongodb-service>` uses a strict rules system
that prevents all operations unless they are specifically allowed.
{+service+} determines if each operation is allowed dynamically when it
receives the request from the client based on roles that you define.

Roles are sets of document-level and field-level CRUD permissions and
are chosen individually for each document associated with a query. This
guide walks through configuring one or more roles for a collection.

.. important::

   You must define at least one role before you can successfully query a
   collection.

.. note::

   This guide requires a :doc:`linked MongoDB Atlas cluster
   </mongodb/link-a-cluster>`.

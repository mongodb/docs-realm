Overview
--------

The :ref:`MongoDB service <mongodb-service>` uses a strict rules system
that prevents all operations unless they are specifically allowed.
{+service+} determines if each operation is allowed dynamically when it
receives the request from the client based on roles that you define.

Roles are sets of document-level and field-level CRUD permissions and
are chosen individually for each document associated with a query. This
guide walks through configuring one or more roles for a collection.

.. important::

   You must define at least one role before you can successfully query a
   collection.

.. important:: Sync Rules
   
   This page describes data access rules for clusters where :ref:`{+sync+}
   <sync>` is not enabled. Synced clusters use a different rules model, which
   takes precedence over non-sync rules. If sync is enabled for a cluster, any
   non-sync rules defined for the cluster do not apply.
   
   For more information on data access rules for synced clusters, see
   :doc:`Define Sync Rules </sync/rules>`.

Procedure
---------

.. note::

   This guide requires a :doc:`linked MongoDB Atlas cluster
   </mongodb/link-a-data-source>`. Roles and permissions do not apply to
   a :ref:`linked Data Lake <data-lake-caveats>` as you can only access
   a Data Lake from a :ref:`system function <system-functions>`.

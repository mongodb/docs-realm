Overview
--------

You can control the shape and contents of documents in a collection by defining
a :ref:`document schema <mongodb-schemas>`. Schemas are regular documents that
adhere to the same JSON schema specification as the :manual:`schema validation
</core/schema-validation>` built into the core MongoDB server. You can use
schemas to control the type of a field's value, require specific fields, and
validate changes before committing the results of insert and update operations.

This guide walks through creating a document schema for a collection in a
:ref:`linked {+atlas+} cluster <mongodb-service>`.

.. note:: Data Lakes Do Not Support Schemas

   Data Lake data sources :ref:`do not support rules <data-lake-caveats>`. You
   can only access a Data Lake data source in a system function.

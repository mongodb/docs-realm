Overview
--------

You can configure the :manual:`read preference </core/read-preference>`
for a :doc:`linked MongoDB Atlas cluster </mongodb>` to control the type
of :manual:`replica set member </core/replica-set-members>` that {+service+}
routes database read requests to. You can also specify a :manual:`tag
set </core/read-preference/#replica-set-read-preference-tag-sets>` to
target specific members of the replica set.

By default, {+service-short+} uses a read preference of ``primary``, which routes
all read requests through the :manual:`primary node
</core/replica-set-primary>` of a replica set.

When To Specify Read Preference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default read preference (``primary``) should be sufficient for most
use cases. Consider specifying a cluster read preference when you need
to do the following:

- Read from a specific secondary that has a custom configuration, such
  as an analytics node with special indexes optimized for reporting
  workloads.

- Read from a node in a specific region of a globally distributed
  replica set.

- Maintain read availability during a replica set failover, i.e.,
  continue to read potentially stale data when there is no ``primary``
  node.

Introduction
------------

Modern applications often use multiple external services to handle
complex use cases, such as messaging, analytics, and data management.
You can connect to these services through {+service+} by creating and
configuring service interfaces.

Service interfaces specify the connection details for a specific
external service and enable you to define the scope of that service's
capabilities with custom :ref:`service rules <service-rules>`.
Once you've configured an interface for a service, you can instantiate a
:ref:`service client <service-clients>` that connects to the interface
and exposes the service's :ref:`actions <service-actions>` as methods.
You can also create :ref:`incoming webhooks <service-webhooks>` that
enable external services to communicate directly with your {+app+}
over HTTP.

.. admonition:: Built-In Service Clients
   :class: note
   
   {+service+} includes clients for certain external services, such
   as :doc:`Twilio </services/twilio>` and :doc:`AWS </services/aws>`.
   You can also use the :doc:`HTTP service </services/http>` to create a
   custom interface for any external service that offers a REST API.

Concepts
--------

.. _service-clients:

Service Clients
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A service client is an object that connects to a service interface and
enables you to call :ref:`actions <service-actions>` associated with
the service. You can instantiate service clients in :doc:`functions
</functions>` (using :ref:`function context
<context-connect-to-an-external-service>`) as well as in your client
application code.

For details on instantiating and using service clients, see :doc:`Call a
Service Action </services/call-a-service-action>`.

.. _service-actions:

Service Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A service action is a method that handles a specific use
case for a particular service, such as :doc:`sending a text
message </services/twilio-actions/send>` with Twilio or
:ref:`putting an object <aws-usage-s3>` to an AWS S3 bucket.
Actions encapsulate implementation details like request
authentication and HTTP methods behind semantic methods that
are specific to each service.

When you :doc:`call a service action </services/call-a-service-action>`,
{+backend+} evaluates each :ref:`service rule <service-rules>` that
applies to the action and prevents execution unless one of the rules
evaluates to ``true``.

.. important::

  **{+service+} blocks all service actions by default.** You must
  :doc:`configure a service rule
  </services/configure/service-rules>` that enables a
  particular action before you can call it.

.. _service-rules:

Service Rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A service rule is a :doc:`JSON expression </services/json-expressions>`
that {+backend+} evaluates to determine whether or not a user can
execute one or more :ref:`actions <service-actions>` in a service.

For example, you could create a :doc:`Twilio </services/twilio>` rule
that only lets users send a text message from a specific phone number or
an :doc:`AWS </services/aws>` rule that prevents users from putting
objects to an S3 bucket that is not included in a list of approved
buckets.

.. class:: note
.. admonition:: Expression Variables

   :doc:`Expression variables </services/expression-variables>` are
   variables that you can include in service rules to represent dynamic
   information about your application and an action's execution. You can
   configure service rules based on the authenticated user that called
   an action (:json-expansion:`%%user`) and the arguments that they
   provided (:json-expansion:`%%args`). You can also create complex
   rules that :ref:`call a Function
   <call-function-json-expression>` (:json-operator:`%function`) and
   evaluate based on the Function's return value.

.. _service-webhooks:
.. _incoming-webhooks:

Incoming Webhooks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An incoming webhook is a custom handler for events that originate from
an external service, such as when someone opens a new pull request on
:doc:`GitHub </services/github>` or sends a text message to a
:doc:`Twilio </services/twilio>` phone number. Get started with incoming
webhooks by :doc:`configuring a service webhook
</services/configure/service-webhooks>`.

Incoming webhooks consist of two primary components: the webhook URL and
the webhook Function.

.. _webhook-url:
.. _webhook-function:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 30

   * - Component
     - Description

   * - :guilabel:`Webhook URL`
     - A URL that uniquely identifies the incoming webhook. External
       services can interact with the webhook by sending an HTTP request
       that matches the webhook's configuration to the webhook URL.

       To use a webhook, provide the webhook URL to an external
       service's HTTP request handler, which may also be referred to as
       an outgoing webhook, callback URL, or similar.

       .. note::

          If an incoming webhook requires a :ref:`secret query parameter
          <webhook-secret-query-parameter>`, make sure that you append the
          query parameter to webhook URL before you provide it to the
          external service.

   * - :guilabel:`Webhook Function`
     - A webhook function is a :doc:`{+service-short+} Function </functions>` that
       accepts an incoming HTTP request with data from the external
       service as its argument and optionally returns an HTTP response.

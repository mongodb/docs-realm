   {
     "app_id": "<Realm Application ID>",
     "name": "<Realm Application Name>",
     "config_version": <Version Number>,

   * - Field
     - Description
   
   * - | ``app_id``
       | String
     - The application's :guilabel:`App ID`.
   
   * - | ``name``
       | String
     - The application's name.
       
       .. include:: /includes/note-app-name-limitations.rst
   
   * - | ``config_version``
       | Number
     
     - The schema version that all configuration files in the application
       conform to. This value is machine generated and you typically should not
       manually set or modify it.
   
   * - | ``allowed_request_origins``
       | Document
     - An array of URLs that incoming requests may originate from. If you define
       any allowed request origins, then {+service-short+} blocks any incoming
       request from an origin that is not listed.
       
       .. tip::
          
          Request origins are URLs with the following form:
          
          .. code-block:: text
             
             <scheme>://<host>[:port]
   
   * - | ``deployment_model``
       | String
     - The application's :ref:`deployment model <realm-deployment-models>`.
       
       Valid options:
       
       - ``"GLOBAL"`` for :ref:`Global Deployment <realm-global-deployment>`
       - ``"LOCAL"`` for :ref:`Local Deployment <realm-local-deployment>`
   
   * - | ``location``
       | String
     - The name of the :ref:`cloud region <realm-regions>` that the application
       is deployed in.
       
       - :ref:`Global applications <realm-global-deployment>` process
         all database writes in this region, but serve other application
         requests in the nearest deployment region.
       
       - :ref:`Local applications <realm-local-deployment>` process all
          application requests and database writes in this region.

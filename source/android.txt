=========================
MongoDB Realm Android SDK
=========================

The {+service+} Android SDK enables client applications on the Android
platform to access data stored in local {+realms+} and interact with
{+backend+} services like Functions, MongoDB Data Access, and
authentication. The Android SDK supports both Java and Kotlin
Android applications.

.. note::

   The Android SDK does not support Java or Kotlin applications
   written for environments other than Android.

Installation
------------

To learn how to add the {+service+} Android SDK library as a dependency
to your Android application, see :ref:`Install Realm for Android
<android-install>`.

The Realm Data Model
--------------------

You can store a wide variety of data within {+realms+} stored on your
device. With :term:`{+sync+}`, you can share updates to that data across
client devices and {+atlas+}.

For information about the structure of data you can store in {+realms+},
see :ref:`Realms <android-realms>`, :ref:`Objects
<android-realm-objects>`, and :ref:`Relationships
<android-client-relationships>`.

To learn about the results returned from {+realm+} queries, see
:ref:`Collections <android-client-collections>`.

Work with Realm Database
------------------------

Once you have defined a data model for your application, you
need to be able to :ref:`write <android-realm-database-writes>` and
:ref:`read <android-realm-database-reads>` pieces of data to and from
your {+realm+}s.

To learn how to query for data in local {+realms+}, see
:ref:`Query Engine <android-client-query-engine>`.

For advice on how to safely interact with {+client-database+} across
threads in an application, see :ref:`Threading
<android-client-threading>`.

For information about how to react to changes in {+realm+} data, see
:ref:`Notifications <android-client-notifications>`.

Work with MongoDB Realm
-----------------------

The Android SDK also connects your {+service-short+} client application
with your {+app+}'s backend services, including Functions, Services,
Webhooks, {+sync+}, and built-in third-party authentication.

To learn how to connect to a {+backend+} app to call
Functions, query data in an instance of {+atlas+}, and synchronize data
in {+realms+}, see :doc:`Call a Function </android/call-a-function>`.

To learn how to authenticate a user using the Android SDK, see
:ref:`Authentication <android-authenticate>`.

To learn how to handle schema updates in your client application, see
:ref:`Migrations <android-client-migrations>`.

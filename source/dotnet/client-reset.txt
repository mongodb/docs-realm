Overview
--------

When using :doc:`{+sync+} </sync>`, it is possible that your client app will 
need to handle a **client reset**. While not common, it can be caused when Sync was 
terminated on the server. For example, a developer deploys a change that includes 
a destructive schema change. To fix this, they must stop Sync, modify the schema, 
and then re-enable Sync. This process causes the server to send a client reset 
message to the clients.

By default, the SDK handles client reset messages automatically, but only on app 
startup. Until then, users will not receive any data from the server, and any 
changes they make will be lost during the reset. Therefore, you should handle 
client resets in your code to ensure users get up-to-date data. 

.. warning::

   A client reset erases all local data and downloads a new copy of the
   data stored in MongoDB Atlas. Performing a client reset loses all local
   changes made since the client last successfully synced.

Example
-------
When a reset is required, {+realm+} sends a  
:dotnet-sdk:`ClientResetException <reference/Realms.Sync.Exceptions.ClientResetException.html>`. 
You can add a listener on the 
:dotnet-sdk:`Session.Error <reference/Realms.Sync.Session.html#Realms_Sync_Session_Error>` 
event and handle the client reset by calling the 
:dotnet-sdk:`InitiateClientReset() <reference/Realms.Sync.Exceptions.ClientResetException.html#Realms_Sync_Exceptions_ClientResetException_InitiateClientReset>` 
method. The following example demonstrates this:

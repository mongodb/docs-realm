Overview
--------

This page contains information to quickly get {+client-database+}
integrated into your .NET app. Before you begin, ensure you have:

- :ref:`Created a {+app+} <create-a-realm-app>`
- :ref:`Enabled {+sync+} <enable-sync>`

.. note::

   See :ref:`Supported Platforms <dotnet_supported-platforms>` for the list of 
   platforms that Realm supports.


Import Realm
------------
In the shared code project of your solution, go to `Manage NuGet Packages`. In 
the NuGet Package Manager, switch to the Browse tab and then search for `Realm`. 
Select the Realm package and then click `Add Package`. 

At the top of each C# file that uses Realm, add the following using
statement:

.. code-block:: csharp

   using Realms;


Initialize the App
------------------

To use {+backend+} features such as authentication and sync, you must
access your {+app+} using your {+app+} ID. You can find your {+app+} ID in the
{+ui+}. With that, you can initialize the {+realm+} app, as shown in the following 
code:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Examples.codeblock.initialize-realm.cs
   :language: csharp

Define Your Object Model
------------------------

Your application's :ref:`object model <dotnet-realm-objects>` defines 
the data that you can store within {+client-database+} and synchronize
to and from {+backend+}.

If have not :ref:`enabled {+sync+} <enable-sync>` or you enabled
{+sync-short+} with :term:`Development Mode` in the {+ui+}, you can
define your object model directly in code.

.. note::

   If you have enabled {+sync-short+} but turned off Developer Mode,
   you can copy and paste the object model definitions that
   {+backend-short+} generated for you from the :guilabel:`SDKs` tab
   in the {+ui+}. You must re-enable Developer Mode if you want to make
   changes to the object model definition from client side code. See
   :ref:`Configure Your Data Model <configure-your-data-model>`.

The following code shows how to define an object model for a ``RealmTask`` object. In 
this example, we have marked the ``Id`` field as the Primary Key, marked the 
``Name`` and ``Status`` properties as "required", and are using the ``MapTo`` 
attribute so we can use .NET-friendly casing on our property names.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Task.codeblock.task-object-model.cs
   :language: csharp

.. _dotnet-quick-start-authenticate:

Authenticate a User
-------------------

After you have enabled :ref:`anonymous authentication <anonymous-authentication>` in the
{+ui+}, users can immediately log into your app without providing any identifying
information:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Examples.codeblock.anon-login.cs
   :language: csharp

You should also provide a way for the user to log out. The following code shows 
how to do this by calling ``LogOutAsync()``:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Examples.codeblock.logout.cs
   :language: csharp

.. seealso:: :ref:`Authenticate a User <dotnet-authenticate>`


Open a Realm
------------

Once you have :ref:`enabled {+sync+} <enable-sync>` and authenticated a user, 
you can open a synced :ref:`{+realm+} <dotnet-realms>`. Use the ``SyncConfiguration``
to control the specifics of how your application synchronizes data with
{+backend+}, which might include the :ref:`partition <partitioning>` name,
whether to wait for an initial batch of data to sync, and more.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Examples.codeblock.config.cs
   :language: csharp

.. seealso:: :ref:`Sync Data <dotnet-sync-data>`


Create, Read, Update, and Delete Objects
----------------------------------------

Once you have opened a {+realm+}, you can modify the 
:ref:`objects <dotnet-realm-objects>` in it. All changes to the data 
(creates, writes, and updates) must occur within a 
:ref:`Write transaction <dotnet-realm-database-writes>` block.

The following code shows how to create a new ``Task``. You instantiate the 
``Task`` class and then add the new Task to the {+realm+} in a write block:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Examples.codeblock.create.cs
   :language: csharp

The following code demonstrates how to retrieve a live 
:ref:`collection <dotnet-client-collections>` of all ``Task`` objects in the 
{+realm+}:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Examples.codeblock.read-all.cs
   :language: csharp

You can also filter that collection using Linq. This example returns all Tasks 
that have a status of  "Open":

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Examples.codeblock.read-some.cs
   :language: csharp

To modify a task, you update its properties in a write transaction block:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Examples.codeblock.modify.cs
   :language: csharp

Finally, you can delete a task by calling the ``Remove()`` method:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Examples.codeblock.delete.cs
   :language: csharp

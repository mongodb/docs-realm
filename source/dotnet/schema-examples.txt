==================
Schema Examples
==================

Create the Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Realm considers any C# class that inherits from ``RealmObject`` or ``EmbeddedObject`` 
a schema definition. 

.. _dotnet-example:

Example
-------

.. example::

   The following code block shows an object schema that describes a Dog.
   Every Dog object must include a ``Name`` and may
   optionally include the dog's ``Age``, ``Breed`` and a list of people that 
   represents the dog's ``Owners``. 

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Examples.codeblock.dog_class.cs
      :language: csharp


.. note::
   
   To define a collection of objects within an object, use an ``IList<T>`` with 
   only a getter. You do not need to initialize it in the constructor, as {+realm+} 
   will generate a collection instance the first time the property is accessed. 

Embedded Objects
----------------
To embed an object, extend 
:dotnet-sdk:`EmbeddedObject <reference/Realms.EmbeddedObject.html>`
for the class that you'd like to nest within another class:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/Schemas/Embedded.cs
   :language: csharp

Then, any time you reference that class from another class,
{+client-database+} will embed the referenced class within the enclosing
class.

Add Attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Class and property Attributes enable finer control over how the schema is defined. 
Using Attributes, you can specify which property represents the primary key, 
how property names should be mapped to different field names in {+service-short+}, 
and relationships between objects.

Specify a Primary Key
---------------------
The following example demonstrates how to designate a primary key in an object schema:
   
.. literalinclude:: /examples/Schemas/PrimaryKey.cs
   :language: csharp

.. note::
   
   Once you assign a property as a primary key, you cannot change it.
   
  
.. _dotnet-required-optional-property:

Required and Optional Properties
--------------------------------

In C#, value types are implicitly non-nullable, but can be made optional by appending 
`?  <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/nullable-value-types>`__.
Reference types, such as ``string`` and ``byte[]``, are implicitly nullable and can be
made required by annotating them with the ``[Required]`` attribute. Properties of types
that inherit from ``RealmObject`` or ``EmbeddedObject`` are special and can always be
null. Applying ``[Required]`` on such a property will result in a compilation error.

You can use the ``[Required]`` attribute as seen in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/Schemas/Required.cs
   :language: csharp


.. _dotnet-default-property-values:

Default Property Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the built-in language features to assign a default value to a property. 
In C#, you can assign a default value in the property declaration. 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/Schemas/DefaultValues.cs
   :language: csharp

.. note:: Default Values and Nullability

   While default values ensure that a newly created object cannot contain
   a value of ``null`` (unless you specify a default value of ``null``),
   they do not impact the nullability of a property. To make a property
   non-nullable, see :ref:`Required Properties <dotnet-required-optional-property>`.


.. _dotnet-property-relationships:

Relationships
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+client-database+} supports several kinds of object relationships.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`Relationships <dotnet-client-relationships>`

.. _dotnet-property-relationships-many-to-one:

To-One
======

To set up a many-to-one or one-to-one relationship, create a property  in your application
whose type inherits ``RealmObject`` or ``EmbeddedObject``:


.. literalinclude:: /examples/Schemas/ManyToOne.cs
   :language: csharp

Each ``Dog`` references zero or one ``Person`` instances. Nothing prevents
multiple ``Dog`` instances from referencing the same ``Person`` as an owner;
the distinction between a many-to-one and a one-to-one relationship is
up to your application.

Setting a relationship property to null removes the connection between
objects, but {+client-database+} does not delete the referenced object
unless that object is :ref:`embedded <dotnet-property-embedded>`.

.. _dotnet-property-relationships-many-to-many:

To-Many
=======

You can create a relationship between one object and any number of objects
using a property of type ``IList<T>``\ in your application, where ``T`` is a subclass of
``RealmObject`` or ``EmbeddedObject``:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/Schemas/ManyToMany.cs
   :language: csharp


.. _dotnet-property-relationships-inverse:

Inverse Relationships
=====================

By default, {+client-database+} relationships are unidirectional. You
can follow a link from one class to a referenced class, but not in the
opposite direction. You can provide a link in the opposite direction
with the :dotnet-sdk:`[Backlink] <reference/Realms.BacklinkAttribute.html>` attribute:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/Schemas/Inverse.cs
   :language: csharp

Since relationships are many-to-one or many-to-many, following inverse
relationships can result in zero, one, or many objects.

Like any other ``RealmResults`` set, you can
:ref:`query <dotnet-client-query-engine>` an inverse relationship.


.. _dotnet-ignore-property:

Ignore a Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you don't want to save a property in your model to a {+realm+}, you can
ignore that property. A property is ignored by default if it is not autoimplemented or 
does not have a setter.

Ignore a property from a {+service-short+} object model with the
:dotnet-sdk:`[Ignored] <reference/Realms.IgnoredAttribute.html>` attribute:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/Schemas/Ignored.cs
   :language: csharp

.. _dotnet-rename-property:

Rename a Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, {+client-database+} uses the name defined in the model class
to represent properties internally. In some cases you might want to change
this behavior:

- To make it easier to work across platforms, since naming conventions differ.
- To change a property name in .NET without forcing a migration.

Choosing an internal name that differs from the name used in model classes
has the following implications:

- Migrations must use the internal name when creating classes and properties.
- Schema errors reported will use the internal name.

Use the :dotnet-sdk:`[MapTo] <reference/Realms.MapToAttribute.html>`
attribute to rename a property:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/Schemas/RenameProperty.cs
   :language: csharp


.. _dotnet-rename-object:

Rename a Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, {+client-database+} uses the name defined in the model class
to represent classes internally. In some cases you might want to change
this behavior:

- To support multiple model classes with the same simple name in different namespaces.
- To make it easier to work across platforms, since naming conventions differ.
- To use a class name that is longer than the 57 character limit enforced by {+client-database+}.
- To change a class name in .NET without forcing a migration.

Use the :dotnet-sdk:`[MapTo] <reference/Realms.MapToAttribute.html>`
attribute to rename a class:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/Schemas/RenameClass.cs
   :language: csharp

.. _dotnet-provide-subset-classes-schema:

Provide a Subset of Classes to your Realm Schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, your application's {+service-short+} Schema includes all
classes that inherit from ``RealmObject`` or ``EmbeddedObject``. If you only want to include a
a subset of these classes in your {+service-short+}
Schema, you can update your configuration to include the specific classes you want:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/Schemas/SubsetClasses.cs
   :language: csharp

.. _dotnet-decimal128:

Using Decimal Values
--------------------
Realm supports 128-bit decimal values with the ``Decimal128`` Bson type. When 
defining a decimal type, you can use the ``Decimal128`` Bson type or the .NET 
``decimal`` type, even though it is only a 96-bit decimal. The SDK automatically 
converts between the two, although you risk losing precision or range. The 
following example shows how to use both the ``Decimal128`` Bson type and the .NET 
``decimal`` type:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/DecimalFun.codeblock.decimal128.cs
   :language: csharp

Indexing
~~~~~~~~

To index a property, use the :dotnet-sdk:`[Indexed] <reference/Realms.IndexedAttribute.html>`
attribute:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/Schemas/Indexed.cs
   :language: csharp

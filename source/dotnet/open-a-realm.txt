Open a Synced Realm
-------------------
To open a synced {+realm+}, call the ``GetInstanceAsync()`` method, 
passing in a ``SyncConfiguration`` object that includes the partition name and 
the user. The following code demonstrates this:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Examples.codeblock.open-synced-realm.cs
   :language: csharp

In the above example, the code shows how to open the {+realm+} *asynchronously* 
by calling ``GetInstanceAsync``. You can also open a {+realm+} *synchronously* 
by calling ``GetInstance``, which is necessary if the device is offline. 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Examples.codeblock.open-synced-realm-sync.cs
   :language: csharp

.. note::

   The first time a user logs on to your realm app, you should open the realm 
   *asynchronously* to sync data from the server to the device. After that initial 
   connection, you can open a realm *synchronously* to ensure the app works in 
   an offline state. 

Open a Local (Non-Synced) Realm
-------------------------------
When opening a local (non-synced) {+realm+}, pass a ``RealmConfiguration`` 
object to either ``GetInstanceAsync`` or ``GetInstance``. The following example 
creates a ``RealmConfiguration`` object with a local file path, sets the 
``IsReadOnly`` property to ``true``, and then opens a local {+realm+}  with that 
configuration information:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Examples.codeblock.local-realm.cs
   :language: csharp

Scoping the Realm
-----------------
The Realm instance implements ``IDisposable``, and you should dispose of a realm 
object immediately after use. The simplest way to do this is by declaring and 
instantiating the realm object in a ``using`` statement:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Examples.codeblock.scope.cs
   :language: csharp

If you require a realm object to be shared outside of a single method, be sure 
to manage its state by calling ``Dispose()``:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Examples.codeblock.dispose.cs
   :language: csharp

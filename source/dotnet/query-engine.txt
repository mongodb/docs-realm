Overview
--------

To filter data in your {+realm+}, you can leverage
{+client-database+}'s query engine. {+client-database+}'s
query engine implements standard `LINQ
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/introduction-to-linq-queries>`__
syntax. See the exact scope of LINQ implemented on the `LINQ
Support page
<https://realm.io/docs/dotnet/latest/api/linqsupport.html>`__.


Operators
---------

There are several types of operators available to filter a
:ref:`Realm collection <dotnet-client-collections>`.
Filters work by **evaluating** an operator expression for
every :term:`object <Realm object>` in the collection being
filtered. If the expression resolves to ``true``, Realm
Database includes the object in the results collection.

An **expression** consists of one of the following:

- The name of a property of the object currently being evaluated.
- An operator and up to two argument expression(s).
- A literal string, number, or date.

.. note:: About the examples on this page

   The examples in this page use a simple data set for a
   task list app. The two Realm object types are ``Project``
   and ``Task``. A ``Task`` has a name, assignee's name, and
   completed flag. There is also an arbitrary number for
   priority -- higher is more important -- and a count of
   minutes spent working on it. A ``Project`` has zero or more
   ``Tasks``.

   See the schema for these two classes, ``Project`` and
   ``Task``, below:

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/Schemas/ProjectAndTask.cs
      :language: csharp

Comparison Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most straightforward operation in a search is to compare
values.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - | ``==``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand expression is equal to the right-hand expression.

   * - | ``>``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand numerical or date expression is greater than the right-hand numerical or date expression. For dates, this evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand date is later than the right-hand date.

   * - | ``>=``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand numerical or date expression is greater than or equal to the right-hand numerical or date expression. For dates, this evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand date is later than or the same as the right-hand date.

   * - | ``<``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand numerical or date expression is less than the right-hand numerical or date expression. For dates, this evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand date is earlier than the right-hand date.

   * - | ``<=``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand numeric expression is less than or equal to the right-hand numeric expression. For dates, this evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand date is earlier than or the same as the right-hand date.

   * - | ``!=``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand expression is not equal to the right-hand expression.

.. example::

   The following example uses the query engine's
   comparison operators to:

   - Find high priority tasks by comparing the value of the ``priority`` property value with a threshold number, above which priority can be considered high.
   - Find just-started or short-running tasks by seeing if the ``progressMinutes`` property falls within a certain range.
   - Find unassigned tasks by finding tasks where the ``assignee`` property is equal to ``null``.
   - Find tasks assigned to specific teammates Ali or Jamie by seeing if the ``assignee`` property is in a list of names.

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/Query/Comparison.cs
            :language: csharp


Logical Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can make compound predicates using logical operators.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - | ``&&``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if both left-hand and right-hand expressions are ``true``.

   * - | ``!``
     - Negates the result of the given expression.

   * - | ``||``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if either expression returns ``true``.

.. example::

   We can use the query language's logical operators to find
   all of Ali's completed tasks. That is, we find all tasks
   where the ``assignee`` property value is equal to 'Ali' AND
   the ``isComplete`` property value is ``true``:

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/Query/Logical.cs
            :language: csharp


String Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can compare string values using these string operators.
Regex-like wildcards allow more flexibility in search.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 60

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - ``StartsWith``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string expression begins with the right-hand string expression. This is similar to ``contains``, but only matches if the left-hand string expression is found at the beginning of the right-hand string expression.

   * - | ``EndsWith``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string expression ends with the right-hand string expression. This is similar to ``contains``, but only matches if the left-hand string expression is found at the very end of the right-hand string expression.

   * - | ``Like``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string expression
       matches the right-hand string wildcard string
       expression. A wildcard string expression is a string
       that uses normal characters with two special wildcard
       characters:

       - The ``*`` wildcard matches zero or more of any character
       - The ``?`` wildcard matches any character.

       For example, the wildcard string "d?g" matches "dog",
       "dig", and "dug", but not "ding", "dg", or "a dog".

   * - | ``Equals`` (C#)
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string is lexicographically equal to the right-hand string.


.. example::

   We use the query engine's string operators to find
   projects with a name starting with the letter 'e' and
   projects with names that contain 'ie':

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/Query/String.cs
            :language: csharp


Aggregate Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can apply an aggregate operator to a collection property
of a Realm object. Aggregate operators traverse a
:ref:`collection <dotnet-client-collections>` and reduce it
to a single value.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 60

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - | ``Count`` (C#)
     - Evaluates to the number of objects in the given collection.

.. example::

   We create a couple of filters to show different facets of
   the data:

   - Projects with average tasks priority above 5.
   - Long running projects.

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/Query/Accumulator.cs
            :language: csharp

Summary
-------

- There are several categories of **operators** available to filter results: comparison, logical, string and aggregate operators.

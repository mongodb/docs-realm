Overview
--------

We recommend calling {+realm+} methods asynchronously. However, .NET console apps 
do not support background threads. So if you are building a .NET 
console app with the async {+realm+} API, you must include a library that 
provides support for asynchronous tasks. 

Usage
-----
In the following example, we have built an example console app that uses the 
`Nito.AsyncEx <https://github.com/StephenCleary/AsyncEx>`_ package to provide 
an ``AsyncContext``, under which we run our {+realm+} code.

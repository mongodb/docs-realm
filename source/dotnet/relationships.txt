Overview
--------

{+service+} allows you to define explicit relationships between the types of
objects in a {+app+}. A relationship is an object property that references
another {+service-short+} object rather than one of the primitive data types. You
define relationships by setting the property type to another class that inherits 
from ``RealmObject``.

Relationships are direct references to other objects in a {+realm+}, which
means that you don't need bridge tables or explicit joins to define a
relationship like you would in a relational database. Instead, you can
access related objects by reading and writing to the property that
defines the relationship. {+client-database+} executes read operations
lazily as they come in, so querying a relationship is just as performant
as reading a regular property.

There are three primary types of relationships between objects:

- :ref:`One-to-One Relationship <dotnet-to-one-relationship>`
- :ref:`One-to-Many Relationship <dotnet-to-many-relationship>`
- :ref:`Inverse Relationship <dotnet-inverse-relationship>`

Key Concepts
------------

.. _dotnet-to-one-relationship:

To-One Relationship
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **to-one** relationship means that an object is related in a specific
way to no more than one other object. You define a to-one relationship
for an object type in its :ref:`object schema <dotnet-object-schema>` by
specifying a property where the type is the related {+service-short+} object type.

.. example::

   An application could use the following object schemas to indicate
   that a Person may or may not own a single Dog by including it in its
   ``dog`` property:
   
   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Relationships.codeblock.one-to-one.cs
      :language: csharp

.. _dotnet-to-many-relationship:

To-Many Relationship
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **to-many** relationship means that an object is related in a specific
way to multiple objects. You define a to-many relationship for an object
type in its :ref:`object schema <dotnet-object-schema>` by specifying a
property where the type is an ``IList<T>`` of the related {+service-short+} object
type.

.. example::
   
   An application could use the following object schemas to indicate
   that a Person may own multiple Dogs by including them in its ``dog``
   property:
   
   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Relationships.codeblock.one-to-many.cs
      :language: csharp


.. note::
   
   To define a collection of objects within an object, use an ``IList<T>`` with 
   only a getter. You do not need to initialize it in the constructor, as {+realm+} 
   will generate a collection instance the first time the property is accessed. 

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Relationships.codeblock.one-to-many-use.cs
      :language: csharp


.. _dotnet-inverse-relationship:

Inverse Relationship
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An **inverse relationship** links an object back to any other objects that refer
to it in a defined to-one or to-many relationship. Relationship definitions are
unidirectional, so you must explicitly define a property in the object's model
as an inverse relationship.

For example, the to-many relationship "User has many Tasks" does not
automatically create the inverse relationship "Task belongs to User". If you
don't specify the inverse relationship in the object model, you need to
run a separate query to look up the user that is assigned to a given task.

To define the inverse relationship, define a getter-only ``IQueryable<T>`` property 
in your object model, where ``T`` is the source type of the relationship, and  
then annotate this property with a 
:dotnet-sdk:`[Backlink(sourceProperty)] <reference/Realms.BacklinkAttribute.html>` 
attribute, where "sourceProperty" is the name of the property on the other 
side of the relationship. The following example shows how to do this with the 
"User has many Tasks" scenario:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Relationships.codeblock.inverse.cs
   :language: csharp

In this example, note that:

- The User object's ``Tasks`` property is defined as a to-many relationship
  (i.e., it is of type ``IList<Task>``).

- The Task object's ``Assignee`` property inverts the relationship and
  refers to any User object that contains this specific Task in its 
  ``Tasks`` property.

Summary
-------

- A **relationship** is an object property that allows an object to
  reference other objects of the same or another object type.

- Relationships are direct references. You can access related objects
  directly through a relationship property without writing any type of join.

- {+client-database+} supports to-one, to-many, and inverse relationships.

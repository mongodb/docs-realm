Overview
--------

A **{+realm+}** is a set of related objects that conform to a pre-defined
schema and share user-level access permissions. Realms may contain more
than one type of data as long as a schema exists for each type.

.. _dotnet-realm-schema:

Realm Schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **{+backend-schema+}** is a list of valid :ref:`objects <dotnet-realm-objects>` 
that each define an object type that a {+app+} may persist. All objects in a  
{+realm+} must conform to the {+backend-schema+}.

A .NET application provides a {+frontend-schema+} when opening a {+realm+}. If the 
{+realm+} already contains data, then it already has a defined schema, and when 
the client application opens the {+realm+}, 
{+client-database+} validates the schema on the client against the existing schema.

To define the schema, you can specify the 
:dotnet-sdk:`ObjectClasses <reference/Realms.RealmConfigurationBase.html#Realms_RealmConfigurationBase_ObjectClasses>` 
property on the 
:dotnet-sdk:`RealmConfiguration <reference/Realms.RealmConfiguration.html>`. If 
you omit this property, then all classes that inherit from 
:dotnet-sdk:`RealmObject <reference/Realms.RealmObject.html>` or 
:dotnet-sdk:`EmbeddedObject <reference/Realms.EmbeddedObject.html>` are added 
to the schema automatically.

.. _dotnet-schema-version:

Schema Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **schema version** identifies the state of a :ref:`{+backend-schema+}
<dotnet-realm-schema>` at a given point in time. {+client-database+} tracks the 
schema version of each {+realm+} and uses it to map the objects in each {+realm+} 
to the correct schema.

Schema versions are ascending integers that you can optionally include
in the {+realm+} configuration when you open a {+realm+}. If a client
application does not specify a version number when it opens a {+realm+} then
the {+realm+} defaults to version ``0``.

.. important:: Increment Versions Monotonically
   
   :ref:`Migrations <dotnet-client-migrations>` must update a {+realm+} to a
   higher schema version. {+client-database+} will throw an error if a client
   application opens a {+realm+} with a schema version that is lower than
   the {+realm+}'s current version or if the specified schema version is the
   same as the {+realm+}'s current version but includes different
   :ref:`object schemas <dotnet-object-schema>`.

Summary
-------

- A :term:`{+realm+}` is a collection of objects that conform to a
  schema. It is not a single, application-wide database. There can and
  usually will be more than one {+realm+} per application.

- A :term:`partition value` is a {+realm+}'s unique identifier.

- {+service-short+} Rules define who can read or write the {+realm+} and apply to the {+realm+} as a whole.

- A :term:`{+backend-schema+}` is a specification of the object types used in a {+app+}.

Overview
--------
{+service+} applications model data as objects composed of property-value pairs
that each contain one or more primitive data types or other {+service-short+}
objects. :term:`{+service-short+} objects <Realm object>` are regular C# classes 
that inherit from :dotnet-sdk:`RealmObject <reference/Realms.RealmObject.html>` 
or :dotnet-sdk:`EmbeddedObject <reference/Realms.EmbeddedObject.html>`.

{+service+} uses :ref:`partitioning <partitioning>` to organize these data objects 
into groups that share the same access permissions, thus reducing the amount of 
data to only that which a given client needs. These groups of similar objects are 
called called :term:`{+realms+} <{+realm+}>`.

{+realms+} are stored locally (on the device) in memory-mapped ``.realm`` files,
which allows the client to quickly access the data even when there is no 
network connectivity to the {+service+} backend.

Overview
--------

{+service+} applications model data as objects composed of property-value pairs
that each contain one or more primitive data types or other {+service-short+}
objects. :term:`{+service-short+} objects <Realm object>` are essentially the same
as regular objects, but they also include
additional features like
:ref:`real-time updating data views <dotnet-live-object>` and reactive
:ref:`change event handlers <dotnet-client-notifications>`.

Every {+service-short+} object has an *object type* that refers to the object's
class. Objects of the same type share an :ref:`object schema
<dotnet-object-schema>` that defines the properties and relationships of those
objects. In most languages you define object schemas using the native
class implementation.

.. _dotnet-example:

Example
--------

.. example::

   The following code block shows an object schema that describes a Dog.
   Every Dog object must include a ``Name`` and may
   optionally include the dog's ``Age``, ``Breed`` and a list of people that 
   represents the dog's ``Owners``. 

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/Examples.codeblock.dog_class.cs
      :language: csharp


.. note::
   
   To define a collection of objects within an object, use an ``IList<T>`` with 
   only a getter. You do not need to initialize it in the constructor, as {+realm+} 
   will generate a collection instance the first time the property is accessed. 


.. _dotnet-live-object:

Live Object
-----------

Objects in {+service-short+} clients are **live objects** that
update automatically to reflect data changes, including
:doc:`synced </sync>` remote changes, and emit
:ref:`notification events <dotnet-client-notifications>` that you
can subscribe to whenever their underlying data changes. You
can use live objects to work with object-oriented data
natively without an :wikipedia:`ORM
<Object-relational_mapping>` tool.

Live objects are direct proxies to the underlying stored data, which
means that a live object doesn't directly contain data. Instead, a live
object always references the most up-to-date data on disk and
:wikipedia:`lazy loads <Lazy_loading>` property values when you access
them from a :ref:`collection <dotnet-client-collections>`. This means that a
{+realm+} can contain many objects but only pay the performance cost for
data that the application is actually using.

Valid write operations on a live object automatically persist to the
{+realm+} and propagate to any other synced clients. You do not need to
call an update method, modify the {+realm+}, or otherwise "push" updates.

.. _dotnet-object-schema:

Object Schema
-------------

An **object schema** is a configuration object that defines the properties and 
relationships of a {+service-short+} object. {+service-short+} client 
applications define object schemas with the native class implementation in their 
respective language using the :term:`{+frontend-schema+}`.

Object schemas specify constraints on object properties such as the data
type of each property and whether or not a property is required. Schemas can 
also define :ref:`relationships <dotnet-client-relationships>` between object 
types in a {+realm+}.

Every {+app+} has a :ref:`{+backend-schema+} <dotnet-realm-schema>`
composed of a list of object schemas for each type of object that the
{+realms+} in that application may contain. {+service+} guarantees that all 
objects in a {+realm+} conform to the
schema for their object type and validates objects whenever they're
created, modified, or deleted.

.. _dotnet-property-types:

Property Types
~~~~~~~~~~~

{+client-database+} supports the following property data types and their nullable counterparts:

- ``bool``
- ``byte``
- ``short``
- ``int``
- ``long``
- ``float``
- ``double``
- ``decimal``
- ``char``
- ``string``
- ``byte[]``
- ``DateTimeOffset``
- ``Decimal128`` from ``MongoDB.Bson``
- ``ObjectId`` from ``MongoDB.Bson``
- A ``RealmObject`` subclass 
- An ``EmbeddedObject`` subclass (see :ref:`Embedded Objects <dotnet-property-embedded>`)
- ``IList<T>`` where T is any of the previous data types (see :ref:`Lists <dotnet-property-lists>`)

The ``byte``, ``char``, ``short``, ``int``, and ``long`` types  are all stored as 64 bit integer values
within {+client-database+}. 

If you choose to provide custom constructors, you must declare a public constructor with no arguments.

.. _dotnet-property-lists:

Lists
~~~~~

Realm objects can contain lists of all supported data types. 
You can model these collections by defining a getter-only property of type
`IList<T> <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.ilist-1?view=net-5.0>`__,
where ``T`` can be any data type (excluding lists).

Lists of objects cannot contain null values - i.e. deleting an object from the database
will also remove it from any lists where it existed. Lists of primitive types can contain null
values. If null values should not be allowed, do not use nullable types
in the list declaration (i.e., use ``IList<double>`` instead of ``IList<double?>``) or
add the :ref:`[Required]<dotnet-required-optional-property>` attribute if the list contains reference types, such as ``string``
or ``byte[]``.


.. _dotnet-property-embedded:

Embedded Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+client-database+} provides the ability to nest objects within other
objects. This has several advantages:

- If using {+sync+}, objects will translate into MongoDB documents that
  follow a :manual:`denormalized data model </core/data-model-design/>`.

- When you delete an object that contains another object, the delete
  operation removes both objects from the {+realm+}, so unused objects
  don't accumulate in your {+realm+} file, taking up valuable space on
  user's mobile devices.

To embed an object, extend 
:dotnet-sdk:`EmbeddedObject <reference/Realms.EmbeddedObject.html>`
for the class that you'd like to nest within another class:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/Schemas/Embedded.cs
   :language: csharp


Then, any time you reference that class from another class,
{+client-database+} will embed the referenced class within the enclosing
class.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`Embedded Objects <dotnet-embedded-objects>`

.. _dotnet-attributes:

Attributes
----------

.. _dotnet-primary-key:

Primary Key
~~~~~~~~~~~

A **primary key** is a property that uniquely identifies an object. You can
create a primary key with any of the following types (or their nullable counterparts):

- ``ObjectId``
- ``string``
- ``char``
- ``byte``
- ``short``
- ``int``
- ``long``

You may define a primary key on a **single 
property** for an 
object type as part of the :ref:`object schema <dotnet-object-schema>`.
{+client-database+} automatically indexes primary key properties, which
allows you to efficiently read and modify objects based on their primary
key. 

If an object type has a primary key, then all objects of that type must
include the primary key property with a value that is unique among
objects of the same type in a {+realm+}. 

.. note::
   
   Once you assign a property as a primary key, you cannot change it.
   
   The following example demonstrates how to designate a primary key in an object schema:
   
   .. literalinclude:: /examples/Schemas/PrimaryKey.cs
      :language: csharp


.. _dotnet-required-optional-property:

Required and Optional Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In C#, value types are implicitly non-nullable, but can be made optional by appending 
`?  <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/nullable-value-types>`__.
Reference types, such as ``string`` and ``byte[]``, are implicitly nullable and can be
made required by annotating them with the ``[Required]`` attribute. Properties of types
that inherit from ``RealmObject`` or ``EmbeddedObject`` are special and can always be
null. Applying ``[Required]`` on such a property will result in a compilation error.

You can use the ``[Required]`` attribute as seen in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/Schemas/Required.cs
   :language: csharp


.. _dotnet-default-property-values:

Default Property Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the built-in language features to assign a default value to a property. 
In C#, you can assign a default value in the property declaration. 

.. literalinclude:: /examples/Schemas/DefaultValues.cs
   :language: csharp

.. note:: Default Values and Nullability

   While default values ensure that a newly created object cannot contain
   a value of ``null`` (unless you specify a default value of ``null``),
   they do not impact the nullability of a property. To make a property
   non-nullable, see :ref:`Required Properties <dotnet-required-optional-property>`.

.. dotnet-index-property:

Indexes
~~~~~~~

**Indexes** support the efficient execution of queries in
{+client-database+}. Without indexes, {+client-database+} must perform a
*collection scan*, i.e. scan every document in a collection, to select
those documents that match a query. If an appropriate index exists for a
query, {+client-database+} can use the index to limit the number of
documents that it must inspect.

Indexes are special data structures that store a small portion of a
{+realm+}'s data in an easy to traverse form. The index stores the value
of a specific property ordered by the value of the property. The ordering of
the index entries supports efficient equality matches and range-based
query operations.

Adding an index to a property makes write operations slightly slower, but makes
certain queries faster. Indexes require space in your {+realm+} file, so
adding an index to a property will increase disk space consumed by your
{+realm+} file.

You can index properties with the following types:

- ``bool``
- ``byte``
- ``short``
- ``int``
- ``long``
- ``DateTimeOffset``
- ``char``
- ``string``
- ``ObjectId``

To index a property, use the :dotnet-sdk:`[Indexed] <reference/Realms.IndexedAttribute.html>`
attribute:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/Schemas/Indexed.cs
   :language: csharp


.. _dotnet-property-relationships:

Relationships
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+client-database+} supports several kinds of object relationships.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`Relationships <dotnet-client-relationships>`

.. _dotnet-property-relationships-many-to-one:

To-One
======

To set up a many-to-one or one-to-one relationship, create a property  in your application
whose type inherits ``RealmObject`` or ``EmbeddedObject``:


.. literalinclude:: /examples/Schemas/ManyToOne.cs
   :language: csharp

Each ``Dog`` references zero or one ``Person`` instances. Nothing prevents
multiple ``Dog`` instances from referencing the same ``Person`` as an owner;
the distinction between a many-to-one and a one-to-one relationship is
up to your application.

Setting a relationship property to null removes the connection between
objects, but {+client-database+} does not delete the referenced object
unless that object is :ref:`embedded <dotnet-property-embedded>`.

.. _dotnet-property-relationships-many-to-many:

To-Many
=======

You can create a relationship between one object and any number of objects
using a property of type ``IList<T>``\ in your application, where ``T`` is a subclass of
``RealmObject`` or ``EmbeddedObject``:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/Schemas/ManyToMany.cs
   :language: csharp


.. _dotnet-property-relationships-inverse:

Inverse Relationships
=====================

By default, {+client-database+} relationships are unidirectional. You
can follow a link from one class to a referenced class, but not in the
opposite direction. You can provide a link in the opposite direction
with the :dotnet-sdk:`[Backlink] <reference/Realms.BacklinkAttribute.html>` attribute:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/Schemas/Inverse.cs
   :language: csharp

Since relationships are many-to-one or many-to-many, following inverse
relationships can result in zero, one, or many objects.

Like any other ``RealmResults`` set, you can
:ref:`query <dotnet-client-query-engine>` an inverse relationship.


.. _dotnet-ignore-property:

Ignore a Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you don't want to save a property in your model to a {+realm+}, you can
ignore that property. A property is ignored by default if it is not autoimplemented or 
does not have a setter.

Ignore a property from a {+service-short+} object model with the
:dotnet-sdk:`[Ignored] <reference/Realms.IgnoredAttribute.html>` attribute:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/Schemas/Ignored.cs
   :language: csharp

.. _dotnet-rename-property:

Rename a Property
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, {+client-database+} uses the name defined in the model class
to represent properties internally. In some cases you might want to change
this behavior:

- To make it easier to work across platforms, since naming conventions differ.
- To change a property name in .NET without forcing a migration.

Choosing an internal name that differs from the name used in model classes
has the following implications:

- Migrations must use the internal name when creating classes and properties.
- Schema errors reported will use the internal name.

Use the :dotnet-sdk:`[MapTo] <reference/Realms.MapToAttribute.html>`
attribute to rename a property:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/Schemas/RenameProperty.cs
   :language: csharp


.. _dotnet-rename-object:

Rename a Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, {+client-database+} uses the name defined in the model class
to represent classes internally. In some cases you might want to change
this behavior:

- To support multiple model classes with the same simple name in different namespaces.
- To make it easier to work across platforms, since naming conventions differ.
- To use a class name that is longer than the 57 character limit enforced by {+client-database+}.
- To change a class name in .NET without forcing a migration.

Use the :dotnet-sdk:`[MapTo] <reference/Realms.MapToAttribute.html>`
attribute to rename a class:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/Schemas/RenameClass.cs
   :language: csharp

.. _dotnet-provide-subset-classes-schema:

Provide a Subset of Classes to your Realm Schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, your application's {+service-short+} Schema includes all
classes that inherit from ``RealmObject`` or ``EmbeddedObject``. If you only want to include a
a subset of these classes in your {+service-short+}
Schema, you can update your configuration to include the specific classes you want:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/Schemas/SubsetClasses.cs
   :language: csharp

.. _dotnet-decimal128:

Using Decimal Values
--------------------
Realm supports 128-bit decimal values with the ``Decimal128`` Bson type. When 
defining a decimal type, you can use the ``Decimal128`` Bson type or the .NET 
``decimal`` type, even though it is only a 96-bit decimal. The SDK automatically 
converts between the two, although you risk losing precision or range. The 
following example shows how to use both the ``Decimal128`` Bson type and the .NET 
``decimal`` type:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/DecimalFun.codeblock.decimal128.cs
   :language: csharp


Summary
-------

- {+service-short+} objects are of a **type** defined as you would any other
  class.

- {+service-short+} objects are **live**: they always reflect the latest version
  on disk and update automatically when the underlying object changes.

- A {+service-short+} object type may have a **primary key** property to uniquely
  identify each instance of the object type.

- The {+service-short+} object's **schema** defines the properties of the object and
  which properties are optional, which properties have a default value,
  and which properties are indexed.

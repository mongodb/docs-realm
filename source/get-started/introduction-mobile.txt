This introduction explains the {+service+} product at a high level for
developers who primarily develop mobile applications. After
reading, you should understand what {+service+} is, how it interacts
with {+client-database+}, and which benefits {+backend+} offers compared
to traditional mobile development stacks.

.. note::
   If you prefer working on the backend or on web
   applications, consider reading the
   :doc:`Introduction for Web Developers
   </get-started/introduction-web>` or the
   :doc:`Introduction for Back-end Developers
   </get-started/introduction-backend>`.

What Problem Does MongoDB Realm Solve?
--------------------------------------

As a developer, you face a number of challenges during the
development of any mobile application. To name a few, mobile developers
must:

- Gracefully handle the unpredictable environment of mobile apps in
  which connections can be lost, devices can shut down at any time, and
  clients usually update with a significant delay after release, if at
  all.

- Coordinate between mobile clients, backend APIs, and databases to
  maintain a common schema of objects and endpoints with which to
  communicate.

- Stay aware of security vulnerabilities across all components in an
  ecosystem, from the HTTP protocol, to API endpoints, to data stored on
  the client.

- Consistently serialize objects between networks, database storage,
  and application memory.

- Program in the languages and frameworks for one or more mobile
  operating systems.

All of these challenges present different obstacles. You can solve each
in isolation with a wide variety of libraries and frameworks. Deciding
which solution solves each problem with the right tradeoffs for your use
case is a challenge most developers know all too well.

In addition to the challenges presented by each component individually,
the combination of multiple components creates even more challenges.
For instance, you can use a Java library on your Android client to
serialize objects in that environment, but consistently serializing
across Android, iOS, the web, and each of your backend services
presents more of a challenge.

Realm Database
--------------

Many, but not all, of these challenges arise due to particularities of
the mobile environment, including network reliability, local storage,
and keeping UIs reactive (up-to-date as underlying data changes).
:term:`{+client-database+}` solves many common mobile programming
headaches:

- **Local storage**: {+client-database+} runs right on client devices.
  Access objects using the native query language for each
  platform, so storing, accessing, and updating your data is simple and
  lightweight.

- **Network reliability**: {+client-database+} is offline-first: you
  always read from and write to the local database, not over the network.
  When :term:`{+sync+}` is enabled, {+client-database+} synchronizes
  data with {+backend+} over the network in a background thread,
  pushing local data changes to {+backend+} and pulling remote changes
  down. The :term:`sync protocol` resolves conflicts
  consistently on each client and in the
  :term:`linked {+atlas+} cluster <linked cluster>`.

- **Reactive UI**: :term:`Live objects <live objects>` always reflect
  the latest data stored in {+client-database+} and allow you to
  subscribe to changes, so you can keep your UI up-to-date at all times.

The {+service-short+} SDK lets you connect to local {+realms+} for Android, iOS,
Node.js, React Native, and UWP development.

MongoDB Atlas
-------------

Client applications generate a lot of data. Whether it's uploaded
reviews and ratings, posts and comments on a blog, or inventory
in a kitchen, you need to store that data somewhere. `{+atlas+}
<https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?tck=docs_realm>`_ provides
cloud-hosted managed instances of MongoDB that are always available.

Atlas supports aggregations and other complex workloads with the full
capabilities of MongoDB. You can connect to your {+atlas-short+}
instance in your backend services using MongoDB drivers for a wide range
of languages. Or connect your {+atlas-short+} instance to `{+charts+}
<https://www.mongodb.com/products/charts?tck=docs_realm>`_ to visualize
your data in real time. Storing your data in {+atlas-short+} makes it
easy to share data across users and platforms.

MongoDB Realm
-------------

{+service+} enables sync between {+client-database+} and {+atlas+},
seamlessly stitching together the two components into an application
layer for your mobile app. To support these services, {+backend+} also
provides components to fulfill several common application requirements:

- :ref:`{+service-short+} Users and Authentication <users-and-authentication>`
  provide built-in user management with easy integration into
  :ref:`third-party authentication providers <auth-providers>`,
  like :ref:`Facebook <facebook-authentication>`,
  :ref:`Google <google-authentication>`, and
  :ref:`Apple <apple-id-authentication>`.

- :ref:`{+service-short+} Functions <functions>` provide server-side logic for
  your :term:`{+app+}`. Similar to endpoints in a REST API, except
  instead of manually constructing the URL, headers, body, and method
  for a call to an HTTP endpoint, you call {+service-short+} Functions from a module
  of the {+service-short+} SDK in your client application.

- :ref:`{+service-short+} Triggers <triggers>` automatically
  execute a function at a scheduled time or when an event occurs, such
  as a change to a database or a call to a HTTP endpoint.

- :term:`{+service-short+} Rules` let you control who accesses what data.

- Server-side :ref:`{+service-short+} Values and {+service-short+} Secrets <values-and-secrets>`
  enable you to define global variables and private credentials once and
  use them across your entire {+app+}.

- Use the :ref:`GraphQL API <graphql-api>` to access data stored in a
  linked MongoDB cluster using any standard GraphQL client.

The {+service-short+} Mobile SDKs let you can call functions, authenticate users,
sync remote {+realms+}, and query your local {+realms+}.

Get Started with MongoDB Realm
------------------------------

Jump right in and :doc:`create a MongoDB Realm application
</get-started/create-realm-app>` or check out our Task Tracker tutorial
for any of these platforms:

- :ref:`Android with Kotlin <android-kotlin-tutorial>`
- :ref:`iOS with Swift <ios-swift-tutorial>`
- :ref:`React Native with JavaScript <react-native-tutorial>`

You can also refer to the documentation for each client SDK:

- :doc:`Android SDK </android>` for Kotlin and Java
- :doc:`iOS SDK </ios>` for Swift and Objective-C
- :doc:`.NET SDK </dotnet>` for C# / Xamarin
- :doc:`React Native SDK </react-native>` for TypeScript and JavaScript

Summary
-------

- {+service+} is a serverless application platform that takes care of
  the details of deployment and scaling for you. You can customize your
  {+app+} with custom logic via functions and triggers, custom
  permissions via rules, and authentication via third-party SSO.

- {+client-database+} is an offline-first mobile object database in
  which you can directly access and store live objects without an
  :wikipedia:`ORM <Object-relational_mapping>`.

- Live Objects and {+sync+} offer significant benefits
  over traditional mobile development stacks:

  - Live Objects always reflect the latest state of data in the database,
    making it easier to keep your UI in sync with changes to your data,
    regardless of where those changes come from.

  - {+sync+} synchronizes data between client-side {+realms+} and the
    server-side {+atlas+} cluster linked to your
    {+app+}. The sync protocol resolves conflicts consistently
    across all instances of a {+realm+}, both on the server and in client
    applications.
  
  - {+client-database+} synchronizes data in a background thread,
    abstracting away network usage so you don't have to worry about
    latency, timeouts, or dropped connections.

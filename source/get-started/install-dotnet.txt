.. admonition:: Update the Fody Weavers File
   :class: important

   Realm depends on the `Fody
   <https://github.com/Fody/Fody>`__ weaver. If you were not
   already using Fody in your project, Visual Studio will
   generate a properly-configured ``FodyWeavers.xml`` file
   for you.

   However, if your project was already using Fody, you must
   manually add the Realm weaver to the ``FodyWeavers.xml``
   file. When done, your ``FodyWeavers.xml`` file should
   look something like this:

   .. code-block:: xml

      <Weavers xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="FodyWeavers.xsd">
        <Realm />
      </Weavers>

   {+atlas+}
      `MongoDB Atlas
      <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?tck=docs_realm>`_ is a hosted
      MongoDB service option in the cloud which requires no installation
      overhead and offers a free tier to get started. To learn more
      about {+atlas+}, see the :atlas:`Atlas documentation <>`.

   {+backend+}
      A cloud-hosted Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) providing client-side
      functionality via the Realm SDK and an administrative interface
      via a website.

   MongoDB document
      See the MongoDB Manual's :manual:`definition of document
      </core/document/>`. For :term:`{+instances+} <{+instance+}>` that use
      :term:`{+sync+}`, every MongoDB document in the {+instance+}'s
      :term:`linked Atlas cluster <linked cluster>` corresponds to
      a synced :term:`Realm object` in a client :term:`Realm`.

   partition key
      A field within a :term:`MongoDB document` whose
      :term:`value <partition value>` determines which :term:`{+realm+}`
      contains the document's corresponding :term:`Realm object`.

   partition value
      A value of a :term:`{+instance+}`'s :term:`partition key` field.
      Every unique partition value corresponds to a different
      :term:`{+realm+}` assignment.

   {+realm+}
      A collection of :term:`Realm objects <Realm Object>` sharing the same
      :term:`partition key` value. Client instances subscribe to
      individual {+realms+} which passively synchronize changes as network
      availability allows.

   Realm client
      Anything that interacts with a :term:`{+instance+}` using the
      :term:`Realm SDK`. Examples include phone apps, IoT devices,
      and server applications.

   Realm SDK
      A library used by a :term:`Realm client` to connect to a
      :term:`{+service+}` application or a local
      :term:`{+client-database+}`.

   {+instance+}
      An instance of the :term:`{+service+}` Backend-as-a-Service.

   {+client-database+}
      An :term:`ACID`-compliant offline-first object database for mobile
      devices. Using the Realm SDK, you can query a local instance of
      the {+client-database+} and synchronize your local instance with data stored
      inside :term:`{+atlas+}`. Offline-first design ensures that
      reads and writes query the local database instance only. When {+sync+}
      is enabled, a separate background thread handles synchronization
      of changes between local {+realms+} and your
      :term:`synced {+atlas+} cluster <synced cluster>`.
   
   Realm object
      An object that you can store in a :term:`{+realm+}`, defined by a
      :term:`{+schema+}` through either any Realm SDK or the
      {+backend-schema+} editor on the {+service+} admin site. Object schemas
      can define primitive fields as well as embedded lists and relations.
      For :term:`{+instances+} <Realm app>` that use :term:`Realm sync`,
      every Realm object in a client Realm corresponds to a synced
      :term:`MongoDB document` in the Realm app's
      :term:`linked Atlas cluster <linked cluster>`.

   GraphQL
      Open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs. {+service+}
      GraphQL supports reading and writing data as well as subscribing
      to data changes. An alternative to :term:`{+client-database+}` queries
      using the client's native query language.

   compaction
      Allocation and deallocation of data within a :term:`{+client-database+}`
      and/or exceeding the size of physical memory can lead to
      fragmentation on disk. Calling the ``compact`` method
      reorganizes internal data structures to reduce the storage
      overhead of local {+realms+} in the event of fragmentation.

   {+backend-schema+}
      A structure that defines the forms of all :term:`MongoDB documents
      <MongoDB document>` that you can read or write into a
      :term:`{+instance+}'s <{+instance+}>`
      :term:`linked {+atlas+} cluster <linked cluster>`. Defined and
      enforeced in your {+instance+}.

   {+frontend-schema+}
      A structure that defines the forms of all :term:`Realm objects
      <Realm object>` that you can read or write into a client-local
      :term:`Realm instance`. Defined natively in the code of your client
      application.

   {+schema+}
      A general term describing the form of all :term:`Realm objects
      <Realm object>` that you can read or write into a client-local
      :term:`Realm instance` and all :term:`MongoDB documents
      <MongoDB document>` that you can read or write into a
      :term:`{+instance+}'s <{+instance+}>`
      :term:`linked {+atlas+} cluster <linked cluster>`.

   Schema Validation
      Rules for an instance of MongoDB that specify the form of documents
      that you can insert into each collection, including both fields
      and values.

   live objects
      Instances of :term:`Realm objects <Realm Object>` that always
      reflect the state of the underlying object in the
      :term:`Realm version` of the enclosing
      :term:`Realm instance <Realm instance>`. Implemented using
      :term:`zero-copy` objects that access object attributes via
      shallow pointers into memory-mapped data. You can subscribe to
      changes to any live object or collection of live objects,
      including Realm instances.

   write transaction
      You can only write to a :term:`{+realm+}` during a write
      transaction. Beginning or committing a write transaction has the
      side effect of advancing the :term:`Realm version` of the
      enclosing :term:`Realm instance`.

   event loop
      A design pattern in which a central loop waits
      for signals from a UI or data source before updating underlying
      data structures. On iOS, known as a :apple-dev:`run loop
      <foundation/runloop>`. On Android, known as a :android-dev:`Looper
      <reference/android/os/Looper>`. Also known as the **main loop** or
      **main event loop** on some platforms.

   Realm instance
      The result returned by a call to ``realm.open()``. An interface
      through which a :term:`Realm client` application can read and write
      to a local :term:`{+realm+}`. Every Realm instance references a
      :term:`Realm version`. You can update the Realm version referenced
      by a Realm instance by explicitly calling the ``refresh`` method
      on that Realm instance. Beginning or committing a write
      transaction on your Realm instance also advances the Realm
      version. Platform with a built-in :term:`event loop` automatically
      refresh the Realm instance on the event loop thread between
      iterations of the event loop.

   Realm version
      A snapshot of data in a local :term:`{+realm+}` at a given moment.
      Each :term:`Realm instance` references a Realm version. The
      :term:`Realm SDK` cannot free resources for a Realm version
      while any :term:`Realm instance` continues to reference it.

   Realm file
      File containing all data for a local :term:`{+realm+}` for an instance
      of :term:`{+client-database+}`.

   zero-copy
      A principle upon which :term:`{+service+}` is built. While traditional
      ORMs copy data from the database into native-language objects,
      :term:`Realm objects<Realm object>` read and write data using
      :wikipedia:`memory mapping </Memory-mapped_file>` to read and
      write data directly to and from the database via shallow object
      wrappers.

   ACID
      An acronym that expands to "Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and
      Durability". {+service+} is :ref:`ACID-compliant <acid-compliance>`. See
      :wikipedia:`the Wikipedia entry for ACID </ACID>` for more
      information.

   Realm webhook
      An HTTP endpoint that calls a function upon request.

   {+function+}
      Server-side logic for your {+instance+}. You can call
      functions from any :term:`Realm client`, from other functions,
      with a :term:`{+trigger+}`, or a :term:`Realm webhook`.

   {+trigger+}
      Execute a function automatically when an event occurs or at a
      scheduled time. You can configure responses to :term:`data changes
      <database trigger>`, :term:`user logins <authentication trigger>`,
      and :term:`scheduled events <scheduled trigger>`. Every trigger
      activation calls a :term:`{+function+}`.

   database trigger
      Call a :term:`{+function+}` whenever a document is added,
      updated, or removed in a :term:`linked cluster`. Passes a
      change event describing the data that changed to the linked
      function.

   authentication trigger
      Call a :term:`{+function+}` whenever a user
      interacts with an :term:`authentication provider`,
      such as whenever a user logs into your :term:`Realm
      app`. Passes an authentication event describing the
      user and interaction to the linked function.

   scheduled trigger
      Call a :term:`{+function+}` based on a schedule that you
      define using a :ref:`CRON expresssion <CRON-expresssions>`.
   
   linked cluster
      A :term:`{+atlas+}` database cluster that is associated with
      your :term:`{+instance+}`. You can define data schemas and access
      rules to control who can access what in any linked cluster.
      :term:`{+client-database+}` data is automatically synchronized with
      your linked cluster when :term:`{+sync+}` is enabled, which
      makes that linked cluster a :term:`synced cluster`. Access
      data in your synced cluster from a :term:`Realm client` using
      the {+atlas+} service in the Realm SDK.

   synced cluster
      A :term:`{+atlas+}` database cluster that is
      :term:`partitioned <partitioning>` into
      client :term:`{+realms+} <{+realm+}>` that
      :term:`synchronizes data <{+sync+}>` via your
      :term:`{+instance+}`. Access data in your synced cluster from a
      :term:`Realm client` using {+client-database+} via the Realm SDK.

   partitioning
      A process that maps :term:`MongoDB documents <MongoDB document>`
      in a :term:`synced {+atlas+} cluster <synced cluster>` into
      :term:`Realm objects <Realm object>` in client
      :term:`{+realms+} <{+realm+}>`. See the :ref:`partitioning`
      documentation for details.

   system function
      A :term:`{+function+}` that runs as the :term:`system user`.
   
   system user
      A user that communicates directly with the :term:`linked cluster`
      and other services, bypassing collection :term:`{+rules+}` and
      :term:`Schema Validation`. This user bypasses most restrictions on
      the
      :ref:`CRUD & Aggregation APIs <mongodb-crud-and-aggregation-apis>`.
   
   custom user data
      A mapped :term:`MongoDB document` that stores arbitrary
      information about a given {+service+} user. For example, you can store
      a user's preferred language, local timezone, or an ID for an
      external service.
   
   external dependencies
      One or more JavaScript modules from ``npm`` that you have uploaded
      to your :term:`{+instance+}`. You can import and use external
      dependencies from any :term:`{+function+}`.

   function context
      A global variable available that allows you to interface with
      components of your :term:`{+instance+}` from a :term:`{+function+}`.
      For example, you can call another {+function-short+}, communicate
      with an external service using the HTTP module, or access data in a
      :term:`linked cluster`.

   {+value+}
      A named reference to a piece of static data defined in
      :term:`{+backend+}`, accessible through :term:`{+function+}
      <{+function+}>` and :term:`{+rule+} <{+rules+}>` expressions.

   {+rules+}
      Boolean expressions that determine the read and write permissions
      for a given :ref:`user <user-objects>` for a particular resource.

   {+secret+}
      A private value stored in :term:`{+backend+}` that
      cannot be directly read, but can be assigned to
      variables. {+secrets-short+} are automatically obscured
      from {+backend+} logs. Common use cases include
      :term:`authentication provider` and service configurations.

   {+ui+}
      A web interface from which you can manage any
      :term:`{+service+}` :term:`{+instance-short+} <{+instance+}>`. For example, you
      can define :term:`{+functions-short+} <{+function+}>`,
      create automated :term:`{+triggers-short+} <{+trigger+}>`, view
      :ref:`logs <logs>`, and link :term:`{+atlas+}` clusters.

   {+sync+}
      Shares data changes between a :term:`{+backend+}`
      :term:`linked cluster` and a :term:`Realm client`-local
      :term:`{+client-database+}`. {+service+} resolves conflicts between
      changes consistently between clients so all connected clients
      eventually arrive at the same state.

   {+sync-protocol+}
      Procedure used by :term:`{+client-database+}` when :term:`{+sync+}`
      is enabled to update local data to reflect remote data changes and
      push local changes to :term:`{+backend+}`. This protocol merges
      changes and resolves conflicts between those changes consistently
      across all synced instances of a :term:`{+realm+}`.

   {+cli+}
      A command line interface named ``realm-cli`` from which you
      can manage any :term:`{+service+}` :term:`{+instance-short+}
      <{+instance+}>`. For
      example, you can define :term:`{+functions-short+} <{+function+}>`,
      create automated :term:`{+triggers-short+} <{+trigger+}>`,
      view :ref:`logs <logs>`, and link :term:`{+atlas+}` clusters.

   Realm Administration API
      A :ref:`HTTP API <admin-api>` through which you can perform
      administrative tasks.

   developer mode
      Allows you to synchronize data between an instance of
      :term:`{+client-database+}` and a :term:`linked {+atlas+} cluster
      <linked cluster>` without defining a strict, inviolable
      :term:`schema <{+schema+}>`. Intended for fast interation during
      early stages of development before defining a schema.

   Sync role
      A set of :term:`{+realm+}`-level permissions that {+backend+}
      evaluates to determine whether a user may sync a
      given {+realm+}. See :ref:`Define Sync Rules
      <sync-rules>`.

   authentication provider
      An integration of a specific authentication mechanism
      into {+service+}'s user authentication system. {+service+}
      provides several authentication providers -- such as
      :ref:`email/password <email-password-authentication>`
      authentication, :ref:`Google authentication
      <google-authentication>`, and :ref:`custom JWT
      authentication <custom-jwt-authentication>` -- that
      you can use in your client application to allow users
      to log in.

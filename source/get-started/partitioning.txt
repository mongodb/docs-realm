The MongoDB Atlas cluster linked to your MongoDB Realm app likely contains a significant amount of data. This data differs from the data
stored on client mobile devices in several ways. 

- The data stored in Atlas takes up more physical storage than any
  single client device generates or has the capacity to store.

- Atlas data encompasses all permissions and all clients; most clients
  (aside from administrators) only require the subset of data that they
  have the permission to read or write.

Realms contain collections of objects that share the same permissioning. A single Realm might contain all of the objects that
one specific user has the permission to write. A single Realm could
also contain all of the objects that a larger group of users has the
permission to read. The concept is the same: a realm is a group of
objects that share the same access requirements. In most cases, a
Realm is only a small fraction of the data stored by your application.

You can break up the large amount of data stored by your Realm app in
MongoDB Atlas into the small collections of data required by individual
clients with partitioning. To partition your data into Realms, you'll
need to assign a :term:`partition key`. The partition key is a field
in every MongoDB docment in every MongoDB collection inside atlas whose value determines the Realm that owns that document. The **partition value** is the value of that field, and each unique partition value translates directly to a unique Realm.

Client devices can sync multiple Realms at a time at the cost of
additional space and additional network usage to sync changes. Sync
Realms from your Realm app to a client mobile device using the Realm Mobile SDKs.

You must specify the partition key for your Realm app when enabling
Realm Sync.

Partition Key Limitations
-------------------------

Because of the relationship between partition values, client synchronization, and permissions, partition values are subject to certain limitations. Specifically:

- the name of a partition key field cannot change
- MongoDB Realm only allows partition values to use the String, ObjectID, Int, or Long types

MongoDB Realm is a suite of products that work together to
make it easy to read, write, and synchronize data across
platforms.

Why Realm?
----------

Designed for mobile development:
  Mobile app developers must deal with unreliable networks,
  limited bandwith, and finite power. Users expect a
  responsive app experience in which they can read and write
  data regardless of connectivity. Realm is specifically
  designed to meet these challenges.

Sync with security: 
  Users expect security while selectively sharing
  synchronized data with teammates, friends, or other user
  groups. Developers want to provide these features without
  dealing with the complexity of integration and upkeep.
  Realm is the only major solution today that scales well
  with both automatic synchronization and access rules.

Infrastructure:
  Building, administering, and maintaining server
  infrastructure takes time and resources. Realm Cloud
  manages all parts of the server infrastructure, enabling
  developers to focus on making your app special and going
  to market faster.

Realm Product Suite
-------------------

MongoDB Realm consists of three products:

Realm Database:
  - Provides a simple and fast alternative to SQLite and Core Data, available for Android, iOS, Node.js, React Native, Xamarin, and UWP development.
  - Eliminates the need for ORMs and other boilerplate data transformation code by working directly with your objects across all supported languages.
  - Simplifies the development of highly concurrent, reactive apps with its powerful threading model and notifications system.

Realm Sync:
  - Synchronizes your data across devices.
  - Provides robust read and write functionality independent of network connectivity or availability.
  - Guarantees strong eventual consistency of data with its built-in conflict resolution.

Realm Cloud:
  - Enables developers to quickly build applications without having to set up server infrastructure.
  - Accelerates app development by providing out-of-the-box authentication, user management, and permission management.
  - Supports serverless application architectures with Triggers and Functions.

MongoDB Realm is a suite of products that work together to
make it easy to read and write data.

Realm Database:
  - Provides a simple and fast alternative to SQLite and Core Data, available for Android, iOS, Node.js, React Native, Xamarin, and UWP development.
  - Eliminates the need for ORMs and other boilerplate data transformation code by working directly with your objects across all supported languages.
  - Simplifies the development of highly concurrent, reactive apps with its powerful threading model and notifications system.

Realm Sync:
  - Seamlessly synchronizes your data across devices.
  - Allows your users to read and write data regardless of network connectivity.
  - Guarantees strong eventual consistency in data with its built-in conflict resolution.

Realm Cloud:
  - Enables developers to quickly build applications without having to set up server infrastructure.
  - Accelerates app development by providing out-of-the-box authentication, user management, and permission management.
  - Allows you to run code on the cloud with Triggers and Functions.

Why Realm?
----------

Designed for mobile development:
  Mobile app developers must deal with unreliable networks,
  limited bandwith, and finite power. Users expect a
  responsive app experience in which they can read and write
  data regardless of connectivity. Realm is specifically
  designed to meet these challenges.

Sync with security: 
  Users expect security while selectively sharing synchronized
  data with teammates, friends, or other user groups. Realm is
  the only major solution today that scales well with both
  Sync and access rules.

Infrastructure:
  Database and server administration and other infrastructure
  pieces are critical and complex, but too many developers
  spend too much time and effort there when these pieces are
  not special to the app they are building. By handling the
  server side for you, Realm Cloud enables you to focus your
  time and resources on making your app special and going to
  market faster.

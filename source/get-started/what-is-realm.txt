:term:`{+service+}` is a suite of products that work together to
make it easy to read, write, and synchronize data across
platforms.

Why Realm?
----------

Designed for mobile development:
  Mobile app developers must deal with unreliable networks,
  limited bandwith, and finite power. Users expect a
  responsive app experience in which they can read and write
  data regardless of connectivity. :term:`{+client-database+}` is
  specifically designed to meet these challenges.

Sync with security: 
  Users expect security while selectively sharing
  synchronized data with teammates, friends, or other user
  groups. Developers want to provide these features without
  dealing with the complexity of integration and upkeep.
  {+backend+} is the only major solution today that scales well
  with both automatic synchronization and access :term:`Rules
  <{+service-short+} Rules>`.

Infrastructure:
  Building, administering, and maintaining server
  infrastructure takes time and resources. :term:`{+backend+}`
  manages all parts of the server infrastructure, enabling
  developers to focus on making your app special and going
  to market faster.

Realm Product Suite
-------------------

{+service+} consists of three products:

{+client-database+}:
  - Provides a simple and fast alternative to SQLite and Core Data, available for Android, iOS, Node.js, React Native, Xamarin, and UWP development.
  - Eliminates the need for ORMs and other boilerplate data transformation code by working directly with your objects across all supported languages.
  - Simplifies the development of highly concurrent, reactive apps with its powerful threading model and notifications system.

{+sync+}:
  - Synchronizes your data across devices.
  - Provides robust read and write functionality independent of network connectivity or availability.
  - Guarantees strong eventual consistency of data with its built-in conflict resolution.

{+backend+}:
  - Enables developers to quickly build applications without having to set up server infrastructure.
  - Accelerates app development by providing out-of-the-box authentication, user management, and permission management.
  - Supports serverless application architectures with :term:`{+service-short+} Triggers <{+service-short+} Trigger>` and :term:`{+service-short+} Functions <{+service-short+} Function>`.

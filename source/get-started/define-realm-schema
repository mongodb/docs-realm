Overview
--------

MongoDB Realm provides Schemas as a way to model data with minimal
overhead and without the use of complex mapping logic or an ODM or ORM.
Schemas can be used with your Realm application or with your cluster
with MongoDB Atlas. 



Define A Realm Schema With MongoDB Atlas:
-----------------------------------------
If you're starting with data in MongoDB Atlas you can use Schema to sample the data in any of your collections and generate a corresponding schema.  You can then edit and extend your Schema in any way that you see fit via standard JSON schema and use our schema validation to test your Schema against your data before moving forward.

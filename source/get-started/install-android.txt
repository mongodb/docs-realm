Overview
--------

Realm's Android SDK enables your Android applications to
interact with Realm using either the Java or Kotlin
languages. This page details how to install Realm in your
project and get started.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before getting started, ensure your development environment
meets the following prerequisites:

- `Android Studio <https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html>`__ version 1.5.1 or higher.
- JDK version 7.0 or higher.
- Android API Level 9 or higher (Android 2.3 and above).

.. admonition:: No Java Support without Android
   :class: important

   Realm does not support Java or Kotlin outside of Android.
   Realm also does not support Eclipse as an IDE. Please
   migrate to Android Studio.

Installation
------------

Realm supports the Gradle build system. The Maven and Ant
build systems are not supported. Follow these steps to add
the Realm Android SDK to your project.

.. admonition:: A note on ProGuard
   :class: note

   Because Realm provides a ProGuard configuration as part
   of the Realm library, you do not need to add any
   Realm-specific rules to your ProGuard configuration.

Overview
--------

{+service+}'s Android SDK enables your Android applications to
interact with {+service+} using either the Java or Kotlin
languages. This page details how to install {+service+} in your
project and get started.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before getting started, ensure your development environment
meets the following prerequisites:

- `Android Studio <https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html>`__ version 1.5.1 or higher.
- JDK version 7.0 or higher.
- Android API Level 9 or higher (Android 2.3 and above).

Installation
------------

{+service+} supports the Gradle build system. Follow these steps
to add the {+service+} Android SDK to your project.

.. admonition:: A note on ProGuard
   :class: note

   Because {+service+} provides a ProGuard configuration as part
   of the {+service+} library, you do not need to add any
   {+service+}-specific rules to your ProGuard configuration.

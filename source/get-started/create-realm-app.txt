Overview
--------

The following steps guide you through setting up a generic {+app+}. The
term ":term:`{+app+} <{+app+}>`" refers to the central {+service+}
backend instance for your mobile or web application.

Prerequisites
-------------
Before you begin, you will need a
`{+atlas+} <https://cloud.mongodb.com/user/register?tck=docs_realm>`_ account.
You can learn more about creating an |atlas| account in the
:atlas:`Atlas Getting Started </getting-started>`
documentation.

Procedure
---------
A. Log on to Atlas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use {+service+}, you must be logged into `{+atlas-short+}
<https://cloud.mongodb.com?tck=docs_realm>`_.

B. Create an Atlas Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create an Atlas cluster to use with your {+app+}, following these steps:

1. In the {+leftnav+}, click :guilabel:`Clusters`, and then
   click the :guilabel:`Build New Cluster` button. The :guilabel:`Create
   New Cluster` page opens.

2. Choose your preferred provider and region, tier, and additional
   settings. As you build your cluster, {+atlas-short+} displays the
   associated costs at the bottom of the page.

   Be sure to select MongoDB version 4.4 for your cluster if you wish to
   use :term:`sync`!

   .. note::

      {+atlas-short+} provides a Free Tier M0 replica set as well as paid M10+
      clusters. Free Tier deployments have restrictions as compared to
      paid M10+ deployments but will work for the purposes of the
      tutorials we offer. For complete documentation on these
      restrictions, see :atlas:`Atlas M0 (Free Tier), M2, and M5 Limitations
      </reference/free-shared-limitations/>`.

3. The default cluster name is :guilabel:`Cluster0`. If you wish to
   change the name, do so now, as cluster names cannot be changed once
   configured.

4. Click the :guilabel:`Create Cluster` button to save your changes.

.. note::

   For detailed information about the options available when creating
   an {+atlas-short+} cluster, see
   :atlas:`Create a New Cluster </create-new-cluster/>`.

C. Add a Realm App
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. In {+atlas-short+}, select the :guilabel:`Realm` tab.

#. If you are creating your first {+app+} in this {+atlas-short+}
   project, click the :guilabel:`Start a New Realm App` button in the
   center of the screen. If you have already created at least one {+app+}
   in this {+atlas-short+} project, click the
   :guilabel:`Create a New App` button in the top right of the screen.

#. In the :guilabel:`Name your Realm application` dialog, enter an
   :guilabel:`Application Name` for your {+app+}.

   .. include:: /includes/note-app-name-limitations.rst

#. Select a cluster in your project in your project from the
   :guilabel:`Link your Database` dropdown. {+service+} will automatically
   create a :ref:`MongoDB service <mongodb-service>` linked to this
   cluster with the name "mongodb-atlas".

   .. include:: /includes/mongodb-4.4-required-for-sync-admonition.rst

#. Select a :ref:`deployment model <realm-deployment-models>` and
   :ref:`deployment region <realm-regions>` for your application.

#. Click :guilabel:`Create Realm Application`.

Upon creation of your {+app+}, you will be redirected to the
{+service+} console. Your {+app+} is created with a
MongoDB service named :guilabel:`mongodb-atlas`.

Overview
--------

The Realm Node.js SDK enables development of applications
using the JavaScript and `TypeScript
<https://www.typescriptlang.org/>`__ languages. Realm on
Node.js is best suited for writing server-side applications.
Your Node.js application could be one component in a wider
stack that also includes iOS and Android apps.

The Realm Node.js SDK is not suitable for front-end
application development.

- Due to limitations of the browser environment, it is not possible to build a browser-based web app with this SDK. For front-end web applications, use the :doc:`Realm GraphQL SDK </get-started/graphql>`.
- For cross-platform mobile app development using web frameworks, use the :doc:`Realm React Native SDK </get-started/install-react-native>`.
- Realm does not officially support other front-end frameworks, such as `Electron <https://electronjs.org/>`__.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before getting started, ensure your development environment
meets the following prerequisites:

- `Node.js <https://nodejs.org/en/>`__ version 8.3.0 (and later versions in 8.x) or Node.js 10.x.
- Linux, macOS, or Windows 8 (and later).

Installation
------------

Follow these steps to create a Node.js project and add the

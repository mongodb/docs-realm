Overview
--------

In modern applications, users update their data continuously. Users also
expect their data to be available and accurate cross-platform and in
real time. Storing your data in `MongoDB Atlas
<http://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/>`_ ensures the availability of
your data. Using schemas ensures the accuracy of the data by
performing type and format checks on fields. 

There are two different types of schemas you will need:

* A :doc:`Realm Object Model </data-model/realms>`, for your mobile application.
* A :doc:`Realm Schema </mongodb/document-schemas>`, for your MongoDB Atlas cluster. 

If you have already started storing your application data on MongoDB
Atlas, you can generate a Realm Schema through ``Automated
Schema Generation with MongoDB Realm`` and translate that Realm Schema
into the Realm Object Model you need for mobile. Alternatively, if you
have not started storing your application data yet in Atlas,
``Development Mode with MongoDB Realm`` allows you to create both
the schemas that you will need.

.. note:: 

  There are some differences between `Realm Schema
  <https://json-schema.org/>`_ and Realm Object Models including the
  structure of relationships and restrictions on certain data types. To
  learn more, read the :doc:`Realm Object Model Restrictions
  </realm-database-restrictions>` page. 

Automated Schema Generation with MongoDB Realm
----------------------------------------------

You can create a Realm Schema if you already have data in MongoDB Atlas.
Navigate through the MongoDB Realm UI to sample the data in your
collection to automatically generate a schema. You can then edit that
schema and translate it into a Realm Object Model for the language of
your choice.

Development Mode with MongoDB Realm
-----------------------------------

Through :guilabel:`Development Mode` in the MongoDB Realm UI, you can develop
your Realm Object Model to use for your mobile application. After developing your Realm Object Model,
MongoDB will automatically generate a Realm Schema for your Atlas
cluster.

.. include:: /includes/steps/development-mode-realm-schema.rst

Summary
-------
- If you already have application data stored in MongoDB Atlas, you can translate your automatically-generated schema into a Realm Object Model to use for your Realm Mobile Application.
- If you want to take your Realm app to production but do not already have application data stored in MongoDB Atlas, you can activate ``Development Mode`` in the MongoDB Realm UI. This will allow you to develop your Realm Object Model and have it automatically translated into a Realm Schema for Atlas.

Overview
--------

View Live Objects in Realtime
-----------------------------

Realm Studio gives you the ability to view live objects while you're 
running a client app in an emulator. You can see how functions in your 
app are transforming objects live in your local {+realm+} file in 
realtime. This is a powerful debugging and development tool.

To view live objects in Realm Studio, you'll need to :ref:`find your {+realm+} 
file <realm-studio-find-a-realm-file>`. Once you know your {+realm+} file 
path, you can open it in Realm Studio while your app is running.

.. note::

   Unfortunately, Android emulators do not support viewing live objects 
   in Realm Studio. If you're developing for Android, you must download 
   the file from the emulator before you can access it.

Query Objects in the Realm
--------------------------

When you view a {+realm+} file in Realm Studio, you can query the objects 
within the file. The Realm Studio query bar at the top of the main pane 
accepts the :ref:`{+client-database+} JavaScript query syntax<node-client-query-engine>`. 
You can query using:

- Comparison operators
- Logical operators
- String operators
- Aggregate operators?
- Set operators?

You can also access a query reference document from within Realm Studio 
by pressing the :guilabel:`?` button next to the query bar.

Export SDK Model Definitions
----------------------------

Realm Studio offers a feature that streamlines cross-platform development: 
export SDK model definitions. 

For example, you may be an iOS developer who has already created a 
schema in an existing app. You now need to declare the same schema for 
your Android app. Recreating that schema in another programming language 
can be time-consuming and error-prone. Instead, you can open your {+realm+} 
file in Realm Studio, and export the model definition in Java.

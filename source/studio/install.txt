Overview
--------

Realm Studio is available for Linux, MacOS, and Windows. Installing it 
is as easy as selecting a version, and downloading and running the 
installer.

Procedure
---------

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Select a version

      The binaries listed on this page are always the latest version of
      Realm Studio.

      If you open an older version of a realm file in a newer Realm Studio
      version, you may see a prompt to upgrade your realm file. Once
      upgraded, you cannot revert to the older file version. You may also
      need to upgrade your SDK to a version that supports the newer file format.

      If you don't want to upgrade Realm, download an older
      version of Realm Studio. You can see a list of all releases at
      `Realm Studio Releases <https://studio-releases.realm.io/>`_.
      Click a version number to view a page listing enhancements, fixes,
      and file downloads.

   .. step:: Download the binary

      Download and extract the correct binary for your operating system.
      You can find all of the binaries for a build by visiting either of
      these pages:
      
      - `Realm Studio Releases <https://studio-releases.realm.io/>`_ page: 
        click into the release version to see all the binaries.
      - :github:`Releases on GitHub <realm/realm-studio/releases/latest>`:
        the binaries are listed as **Assets** on the build version.

      Run the executable file. Follow installer instructions.

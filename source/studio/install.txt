   .. step:: Select a version


      The binaries listed on this page are always the latest version of
      Realm Studio.

      If you open an older version of a realm file in a newer Realm Studio
      version, you may see a prompt to upgrade your realm file. Once
      upgraded, you cannot revert to the older file version. You may also
      need to upgrade your SDK to a version that supports the newer file format.

      If you don't want to upgrade Realm Database, download an older
      version of Realm Studio. You can see a list of all releases at
      `Realm Studio Releases <https://studio-releases.realm.io/>`_.

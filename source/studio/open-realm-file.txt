Find a Realm File
-----------------

Tabs per language/framework

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Swift
      :tabid: swift

      .. code-block:: swift

         // Get on-disk location of the default Realm
         let realm = try! Realm()
         print("Realm is located at:", realm.configuration.fileURL!)

   .. tab:: JavaScript
      :tabid: javascript

      .. code-block:: javascript

         // Get on-disk location of the default Realm
         Realm.open({}).then(realm => {
             console.log("Realm is located at: " + realm.path);
         });

   .. tab:: Java
      :tabid: java
    
      The filesystem used by Android emulators is not directly accessible 
      from the machine running Realm Studio. You must download the file
      from the emulator before you can access it.

      First, find the path of the file on the emulator:

      .. code-block:: java

         // Run this on the device to find the path on the emulator
         Realm realm = Realm.getDefaultInstance();
         Log.i("Realm", realm.getPath());

      Then, download the file using ADB. You can do this while the app 
      is running.

      .. code-block:: java

         > adb pull <path>

      You can also upload the modified file again using ADB, but only 
      when the app isn't running. Uploading a modified file while the 
      app is running can corrupt the file.

      .. code-block:: java

         > adb push <file> <path>

   .. tab:: .Net
      :tabid: net

      .. code-block:: csharp

         var realm = Realm.GetInstance();
         Console.WriteLine($"Realm is located at: {realm.Config.DatabasePath}");

Open a Realm File

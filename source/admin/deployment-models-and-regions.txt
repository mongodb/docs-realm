Overview
--------

When you first create a {+app+}, you must select a
:ref:`deployment type <realm-deployment-models>` that determines where
your application's data is stored and processed. You can deploy your
{+app+} globally or limit the deployment to a specific
:ref:`cloud deployment region <realm-regions>`.

Global Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Globally deployed {+app+}s are hosted in every :ref:`cloud
region <realm-regions>` that {+service+} supports. The {+service-short+} SDKs
automatically execute application requests, such as reading user
information or calling a function in the cloud region that's closest to
the user that issued the request.

Write operations to a linked MongoDB cluster are handled within a single
region that you specify when you :doc:`create your application
</get-started/create-realm-app>`. By default, {+service-short+} handles writes in
the region closest to your application's original linked MongoDB
cluster.

Local Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Locally deployed {+app+}s are hosted in a specific :ref:`cloud region
<realm-regions>` that you specify when you first :doc:`create your
application </get-started/create-realm-app>`. Application requests and
MongoDB write operations will all be handled exclusively in the
specified region. By default, local applications are deployed in the
region that is closest to your application's initial linked `{+atlas+}
<https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?tck=docs_realm>`_ data source or
``us-east-1`` if there is no linked data source.

.. _realm-regions:

Cloud Deployment Regions
------------------------

{+service+} supports deployment and writes in the following AWS regions:

- Virginia (``us-east-1``)
- Oregon (``us-west-2``)
- Ireland (``eu-west-1``)
- Sydney (``ap-southeast-2``)

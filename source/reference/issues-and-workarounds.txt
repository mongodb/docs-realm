Sync
----

Sync fails to enable shortly after cluster creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enabling {+sync+} on a newly-created cluster may fail with an error
message about parsing the URI. This happens because an SRV record hasn't
propagated yet. While we work to provide more helpful diagnostics around
this issue, there are two possible workarounds:

- Wait five minutes, then enable {+sync+}.
- Unlink and :ref:`re-link the cluster <link-a-data-source>`.

.. _mongodb-service-limitations-overview:

Overview
--------

{+service+} has several guidelines to keep in mind when architecting how
your tools and clients interact with MongoDB through {+service-short+}.
Keep this guidance in mind when deciding how to structure queries,
selecting which CRUD and aggregation operations to use, and determining
how to handle concurrent workloads.

.. Please keep these sections alphabetized by section title.

.. _mongodb-service-limitations-aggregation:

Aggregation
-----------

{+service-short+} supports all :manual:`aggregation pipeline
stages </reference/operator/aggregation-pipeline/>` in
:ref:`system functions <function-system-user>` except for ``$currentOp``
and ``$indexStats``.

For security reasons, only a subset of aggregation pipeline stages are
supported in :ref:`user functions <function-active-user>`.

For a list of pipeline stages that are available and their allowed function
context, see :ref:`Aggregation <mongodb-crud-and-aggregation-apis-aggregation>`.

.. _mongodb-service-limitations-atlas-support:

Atlas
-----

Batch Loading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When data is bulk/batch loaded into {+atlas+}, you may see a delay in
data appearing on devices while {+service+} processes changes.

Serverless Instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+service-short+} does not support `Serverless Instances
<https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/serverless>`__ at this time.

Sharded Clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+sync+} does not currently support sharded {+atlas+} clusters. However,
you can add a sharded cluster as a data source and access it from a
:ref:`function <functions>`.

Time Series Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:manual:`Time series collections </core/timeseries-collections/>` do not
yet support :manual:`change streams </changeStreams/>`. Therefore,
you cannot define triggers on or sync to a time series collection.

.. _mongodb-service-limitations-change-streams:

Change Streams
--------------

{+service-short+} limits the total number of change streams open against a given
cluster across all {+app+}s based on the cluster's size. It also limits the
number of client applications that can concurrently listen for changes using
``watch()`` and :ref:`Sync <sync>`. The
following table lists the limitations for each cluster size:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 30 30

   * - Cluster Size
     - Maximum Number of Change Streams
     - Maximum Number of Concurrent Listening Clients

   * - Free Tier (``M0``)
     - 5
     - 250

   * - Shared Clusters (``M2``/``M5``)
     - 10
     - 500

   * - Small, Dedicated Clusters (``M10``/``M20``)
     - 100
     - 1000

   * - Standard Clusters (``M30``/``M40``)
     - 1000
     - 10000

   * - Standard Clusters (``M50`` - ``M90``)
     - 2500
     - 50000

   * - High-Power Clusters (``M100+``)
     - 2500
     - 100000 (Contact Support for Additional Usage)

.. note::

   {+service-short+} opens a single change stream on each collection that is
   associated with a :ref:`Database Trigger <database-trigger>`, :ref:`Collection Sync
   <sync>`, or ``watch()`` operation.

.. important:: Usage Recommendation

   To minimize the number of concurrent listening clients and open
   change streams:

   - Start Watch and Sync operations only when necessary. Close any open
     Watch and Sync streams immediately when they're no longer
     necessary.

   - Avoid data models that require you to Watch or Sync an unbounded
     number of collections.

.. _mongodb-service-limitations-database-commmands:

Database Commands
-----------------

{+service-short+} does not support any :manual:`database commands
</reference/command>` in the Client SDKs or :doc:`Functions
</functions>`. You can, however, call a limited subset of database
commands when when connected to a MongoDB cluster over the :ref:`wire
protocol <wire-protocol>`. For a list of supported commands, see
:ref:`Database Commands
<mongodb-crud-and-aggregation-apis-database-commands>`.

.. _mongodb-service-limitations-version-requirements:

MongoDB Version Requirements
----------------------------

You can access most of the CRUD and Aggregation functionality of MongoDB
version 3.6 with the :doc:`MongoDB service </mongodb>`; however, {+service+}
does not support all operations and features available in standard tools
and clients. For a list of specific MongoDB operations that
are available when you connect to MongoDB through {+service-short+}, see
:ref:`the CRUD & Aggregation API reference
<mongodb-crud-and-aggregation-apis>`.

{+sync+} requires {+atlas+} clusters to run
MongoDB 4.4.0 or greater. 

.. _mongodb-service-limitations-query-options:

Query Options
-------------

{+service-short+} supports all query options in :ref:`system functions
<function-system-user>`. {+service-short+} does not support certain options for
CRUD operations run from :ref:`user functions <function-active-user>`. For a
list of specific options that are available when you connect to MongoDB through
{+service-short+}, see :ref:`Query Options
<mongodb-crud-and-aggregation-apis-query-options>`.

.. _mongodb-service-limitations-query-results:

Query Results
-------------

MongoDB queries executed through {+service-short+} can return a maximum of 50,000
documents. If you need to return more documents, consider paginating
your query.

.. _mongodb-service-limitations-request-traffic:

Request Traffic
---------------

{+service+} limits request traffic to 5,000 concurrent requests. Any 
requests made beyond this limit return an HTTP response status code of 
`429 - Too Many Requests <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429>`_.
You can request a higher limit by `filing a support ticket
<https://support.mongodb.com/welcome>`__.

.. _mongodb-service-limitations-rules:

Rules 
-----

{+sync+} supports :ref:`{+sync-short+} rules<sync-rules>`.
{+sync+} does not support :ref:`roles/field-level
rules<define-roles-and-permissions>` at this time.

.. _mongodb-service-limitations-static-hosting:

Static Hosting
--------------

{+service-short+} enforces a 25MB maximum file size constraint on
:doc:`static hosting </hosting/>`.

.. _mongodb-service-limitations-concurrent-workloads:

Sync - Concurrent Workloads
---------------------------

Writing:
  {+service+} supports up to 30 users concurrently writing data to an
  underlying MongoDB document. With more than 30 concurrent writers, you
  may see delays in syncing or conflict resolution.

Reading:
  Frontend clients reading from a global {+realm+} can scale past tens
  of thousands of concurrent users.

.. _scalability:

.. tip:: Scalability
   
   When you intend to have many concurrent writers, have each writer
   work on a separate document.

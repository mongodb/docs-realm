Overview
--------

If you have :ref:`enabled Realm Sync <enable-sync>`, you may have to terminate and re-enable {+sync+} for one of the following reasons:

- An upgrade from a Shared Tier {+atlas-short+} Cluster to a Shared or Dedicated instance
- A move to an {+atlas-short+} cluster that is distributed across regions/cloud providers
- An upgrade to NVMe Atlas clusters
- An :manual:`oplog </core/replica-set-oplog/>` rollover
- A paused {+sync+} session on a shared tier cluster due to infrequent usage 
- Troubleshooting, at the request of MongoDB Support

.. _terminating-realm-sync:

Terminate Realm Sync 
--------------------
Terminate {+sync+} in your {+app+} to stop syncing data across
devices. 

.. warning:: Recovering Unsynchronized Changes after Terminating Sync
 
 Terminating and re-enabling {+sync+} prevents unsynchronized client changes
 from automatically syncing. To recover any unsynchronized changes, implement a
 manual client reset that handles this case in your client applications:

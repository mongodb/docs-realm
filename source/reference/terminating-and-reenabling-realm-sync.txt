Overview
--------

If you have :ref:`enabled Realm Sync <enable-sync>`, you may have to terminate and reenable {+sync+} for one of the following reasons:

- An upgrade from a Shared Tier {+atlas-short+} Cluster to a Shared or Dedicated instance
- When moving an {+atlas-short+} cluster across regions/cloud providers
- When upgrading NVMe Atlas clusters
- If the Oplog rolls over due to a Bug or misconfiguration
- If {+sync+} becomes paused on a shared tier cluster with in-frequent usage 
- For certain troubleshooting steps (at the request of MongoDB Support)

.. _terminating-realm-sync:

Terminate Realm Sync 
--------------------
Terminate {+sync+} in your {+backend+} application to stop syncing data across
devices. 

.. warning:: 
 
 Terminating/Re-enabling Sync will prevent local changes that you have not
 synced yet from syncing. If you plan on terminating Sync in production and wish
 to capture any write transaction that you have not sent to the Realm server
 yet, you should ensure that your applications have client reset logic that
 handles this case. 

 To learn how to perform a client reset, see the documentation for the Realm SDKs:

successful.

Overview
--------

{+service+} allows you to upgrade your shared tier cluster (**M0**, **M2**, and
**M5**) to a dedicated cluster. Upgrade your cluster before releasing a Realm
Sync application by completing the following steps.

.. note::

   Using a shared tier cluster on a production application is not recommended.
   To avoid data loss, upgrade to a dedicated tier cluster before releasing your
   application.

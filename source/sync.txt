Overview
--------

To sync data across devices, you can :ref:`enable {+sync+} <enable-sync>` for your
{+app+}. {+sync+} automatically handles complex and tedious issues like data
serialization, network recovery, and conflict resolution, so you can focus on the actual
business logic of your app.

To understand how best to use {+sync+}, it's important to understand the problem
{+sync-short+} aims to address.

.. _the-connectivity-problem:

The Connectivity Problem
------------------------

:term:`{+client-database+}` is a local, mobile database in
which your app can store data. Eventually, most apps
need to share that data with the outside world.
Consider a few examples:

- A team collaborates in real-time on a shared
  document across the Internet.

- A front-line worker fills out a report while
  working somewhere with low or no network connectivity.

- An IoT device uploads its sensor data to the cloud.

Traditionally, developers use an HTTP client in a mobile app to
manually communicate with a REST API over the Internet. This means that
every mobile app needs to solve the following problems for every
client platform:

- serialization

- a consistent schema of objects

- gracefully handling network failures and slowdowns

- resolving conflicts between changes to the same data on different
  clients

{+sync+} handles network access and conflict resolution in a
background thread of your application, so your application logic stays
the same regardless of network conditions. The :term:`{+service-short+} data model`
makes it easy to manage a consistent schema of objects in your database
and across all client platforms.

.. _offline-first:

Think Offline-first
-------------------

{+sync+} is built on the assumption that connectivity will
drop. We call this mentality **offline-first**. After you
make changes to the local {+realm+} on the client device, the {+service-short+}
SDK automatically sends the changes to the server as soon
as possible. Likewise, the {+service-short+} SDK automatically receives
changes from the server and integrates those changes into
the local {+realm+}. In effect, you continue to work with the
local {+realm+} without moment-to-moment concern for network
connectivity or lack thereof.

The offline-first design leads to some of the main benefits
of {+service+}:

Seamless User Experience:
  Users interact with local data with zero latency
  regardless of their moment-to-moment connectivity.

Live Objects Across Devices:
  {+service+}'s :term:`live objects` concept extends across
  devices: updates on one device sync to the corresponding
  objects on other devices. :term:`Notifications` based on
  these updates make it easy to update the application UI to
  react to local and remote changes.

It's Automatic:
  {+sync+} is built into the {+service-short+} SDK. You do not need to write
  your own synchronization protocol and deal with connectivity
  issues when synchronizing data. The :term:`sync protocol` is
  the same across platforms. {+service+} handles passing the
  objects across the network automatically, so there is no
  need to map from one platform's database to another or
  serialize and deserialize objects in order to send and
  receive them over the network.

Despite these advantages, offline-first design introduces one
problem: if client devices can remain offline while changes
are made locally and remotely, they must share those changes
when those client devices come back online.
To make matters more complicated, every client device must
arrive at the same state when all changes have been synced.
This is why {+sync+} includes **automatic conflict resolution**.

.. _conflict-resolution-overview:

Resolving Conflicts
-------------------

{+service+}'s :term:`sync conflict resolution engine <sync protocol>` is
deterministic. Changes received out-of-order eventually converge on the
same state across the server and all clients. As such, {+sync+}
is :wikipedia:`strongly eventually consistent
<Eventual_consistency#Strong_eventual_consistency>`.

.. note:: Realm Sync's Internal Conflict

   From {+service+}'s perspective, changesets may
   arrive any time that connectivity allows. There is no
   guarantee that an earlier-timestamped changeset from one
   client actually arrives before a later-timestamped
   changeset from another client. As a result, the server
   has to be able to process events out-of-order. {+service+}
   keeps a per-{+realm+} transaction history to deal with the
   out-of-order nature of messages.

In simple terms, {+sync+}'s conflict resolution comes down
to **last write wins**. {+sync+} also uses more
sophisticated techniques like :wikipedia:`operational
transform <Operational_transformation>` to handle, for
example, insertions into lists.

.. _realm-sync-best-practices:

Best Practices
--------------

We recommend following these best practices to ensure optimal {+app+}
performance:

Deployment model and geographic regions:
  Use a local {+service-short+} :ref:`deployment model<realm-local-deployment>` 
  when building a {+sync+} application. Configure your {+app+} and
  MongoDB data source to run within the same geographic region and cloud
  provider.

Atlas oplog:
  {+sync+} requires access to the {+atlas+} oplog. For best results,
  keep 48 hours of oplog for a cluster using {+sync-short+}. 

.. seealso::

   :atlas:`Atlas oplog </reference/atlas-oplog>`

Summary
-------

- {+sync+} enables offline-first app development by handling network
  loss and recovery automatically.

- {+sync+} has a built-in conflict resolution engine that guarantees
  strong eventual consistency.

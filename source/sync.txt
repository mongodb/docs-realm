Enable Sync
-----------

You can enable {+sync-short+} on any {+app+} you have :ref:`created <create-a-realm-app>`.

.. note::

   {+service-short+} syncs all data from collections with a defined
   :ref:`{+backend-schema+} <mongodb-schemas>` in your :term:`Atlas cluster <linked
   cluster>`. If you do not specify a field in your schema, Realm will not sync that
   field to the clients.

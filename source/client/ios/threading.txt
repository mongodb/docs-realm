Overview
--------

To make your iOS and tvOS apps fast and responsive, you must
balance the computing time needed to lay out the visuals and
handle user interactions with the time needed to process
your data and run your business logic. Typically, app
developers spread this work across multiple threads: the
main or UI thread for all of the user interface-related
work, and one or more background threads to compute heavier
workloads before sending it to the UI thread for
presentation. By offloading heavy work to background
threads, the UI thread can remain highly responsive
regardless of the size of the workload. But it can be
notoriously difficult to write thread-safe, performant, and
maintainable multithreaded code that avoids issues like
deadlocking and race conditions. {+service+} aims to
simplify this for you.

Three Rules to Keep in Mind
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+service+} enables simple and safe multithreaded code when you
follow these three rules:

Don't lock to read:
  {+client-database+}'s :ref:`Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC)
  <ios-mvcc>` architecture eliminates the need to lock for read operations. The
  values you read will never be corrupted or in a
  partially-modified state. You can freely read from {+realms+}
  on any thread without the need for locks or mutexes.
  Unnecessarily locking would be a performance bottleneck
  since each thread might need to wait its turn before
  reading.

Avoid writes on the UI thread if you write on a background thread:
  You can :ref:`write <ios-realm-database-writes>` to a
  {+realm+} from any thread, but there can be only one
  writer at a time. Consequently, write transactions block
  each other. A write on the UI thread may result in your
  app appearing unresponsive while it waits for a write on a
  background thread to complete. If you are using
  :doc:`{+sync+} </sync/sync-overview>`, avoid writing on
  the UI thread as {+sync-short+} writes on a background
  thread.

Don't pass live objects, collections, or {+realms+} to other threads:
  Live objects, collections, and {+realm+} instances are
  **thread-confined**: that is, they are only valid on the
  thread on which they were created. Practically speaking,
  this means you cannot pass live instances to other
  threads. However, {+client-database+} offers several mechanisms for
  :ref:`sharing objects across threads
  <ios-communication-across-threads>`.

.. _ios-communication-across-threads:

Communication Across Threads
----------------------------

You can have the same {+realm+} open on multiple threads as
separate {+realm+} instances. You are free to read and write
with {+realm+} instances on the thread where you first opened
them. One of the key rules when working with {+client-database+} in a
multithreaded environment is that objects are
**thread-confined**: you may not access the instances of a
{+realm+}, collection, or object that originated on other
threads. {+client-database+}'s :ref:`Multiversion Concurrency Control
(MVCC) <ios-mvcc>` architecture means that there could be many
active versions of an object at any time. Thread-confinement
ensures that all instances in that thread are of the same
internal version.

A :term:`{+realm+} instance` is designed to work with one version at a
time, not several different versions. Consider what {+client-database+}
would have to do to support this: it would need to store a
potentially enormous graph to allow the {+realm+} instance to
reconcile the different object versions internally. Faced
with this, it seems more reasonable to impose the limitation
that you cannot pass live instances across threads. This
design choice keeps the implementation relatively simple,
more space-efficient, and more performant as a result.

When you need to communicate across threads, you have
several options depending on your use case:

- To work modify the data on two threads, :ref:`query <ios-client-query-engine>`
  for the object on both threads.

- To react to changes made on any thread, use {+client-database+}'s
  :ref:`notifications <ios-client-notifications>`.

- To see changes from other threads in the {+realm+} on the current
  thread, :ref:`refresh <ios-refreshing-realms>` your {+realm+} instance.

- To send a fast, read-only view of the object to other threads,
  :ref:`"freeze" <ios-frozen-objects>` the object.

- To keep and share many read-only views of the object in your app, copy
  the object from the {+realm+}.

.. _ios-refreshing-realms:

Refreshing Realms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you open a {+realm+}, it reflects the most recent
successful write commit and remains on that version until it
is **refreshed**. This means that the {+realm+} will not see
changes that happened on another thread until the next
refresh. {+realms+} on the UI thread -- more precisely, on any
:term:`event loop` thread -- automatically refresh themselves at the
beginning of that thread's loop. However, you must manually
refresh {+realm+} instances that do not exist on loop threads or
that have auto-refresh disabled.

.. _ios-frozen-objects:

Frozen Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Live, thread-confined objects work fine in most cases.
However, some apps -- those based on reactive, event
stream-based architectures, for example -- need to send
immutable copies around to many threads for processing
before ultimately ending up on the UI thread. Making a deep
copy every time would be expensive, and {+client-database+} does not allow
live instances to be shared across threads. In this case,
you can **freeze** objects, collections, and {+realms+}.

Freezing creates an immutable view of a specific object,
collection, or {+realm+} that still exists on disk and does not
need to be deeply copied when passed around to other
threads. You can freely share a frozen object across threads
without concern for thread issues.

When working with frozen objects, an attempt to do any of
the following throws an exception:

- Opening a write transaction on a frozen {+realm+}.
- Modifying a frozen object.
- Adding a change listener to a frozen {+realm+}, collection, or object.

Once frozen, it is not possible to unfreeze an object. You
can use ``isFrozen()`` to check if the object is frozen.
This method is always thread-safe.

To modify a frozen object, query for it on an unfrozen
{+realm+}, then modify it.

Frozen objects are not live and do not automatically update.
They are effectively snapshots of the object state at the
time of freezing.

When you freeze a {+realm+}, its child objects also become
frozen.

Frozen objects remain valid as long as the live {+realm+} that
spawned them stays open. Therefore, avoid closing the live
{+realm+} until all threads are done with the frozen objects.
You can close frozen {+realm+} before the live {+realm+} is closed.

.. admonition:: On caching frozen objects
   :class: important

   Caching too many frozen objects can have a negative
   impact on the {+realm+} file size. "Too many" depends on your
   specific target device and the size of your {+service-short+}
   objects. If you need to cache a large number of versions,
   consider copying what you need out of the {+realm+} instead.

.. _ios-mvcc:

Realm's Threading Model in Depth
--------------------------------

{+client-database+} provides safe, fast, lock-free, and concurrent access
across threads with its :wikipedia:`Multiversion Concurrency
Control (MVCC) <Multiversion_concurrency_control>`
architecture.

Compared and Contrasted with Git
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are familiar with a distributed version control
system like `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`__, you may already
have an intuitive understanding of MVCC. Two fundamental
elements of Git are:

- Commits, which are atomic writes.
- Branches, which are different versions of the commit history.

Similarly, {+client-database+} has atomically-committed writes in the form
of :ref:`transactions <ios-realm-database-writes>`. {+client-database+} also has many
different versions of the history at any given time, like
branches.

Unlike Git, which actively supports distribution and
divergence through forking, a {+realm+} only has one true latest
version at any given time and always writes to the head of
that latest version. {+client-database+} cannot write to a previous
version. This makes sense: your data should converge on one
latest version of the truth.

Internal Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A {+realm+} is implemented using a :wikipedia:`B+ tree
<B%2B_tree>` data structure. The top-level node represents a
version of the {+realm+}; child nodes are objects in that
version of the {+realm+}. The {+realm+} has a pointer to its latest
version, much like how Git has a pointer to its HEAD commit.

{+client-database+} uses a copy-on-write technique to ensure
:wikipedia:`isolation <Isolation_(database_systems)>` and
:wikipedia:`durability <Durability_(database_systems)>`.
When you make changes, {+client-database+} copies the relevant part of the
tree for writing. {+client-database+} then commits the changes in two
phases:

- {+client-database+} writes changes to disk and verifies success.
- {+client-database+} then sets its latest version pointer to point to the newly-written version.

This two-step commit process guarantees that even if the
write failed partway, the original version is not corrupted
in any way because the changes were made to a copy of the
relevant part of the tree. Likewise, the {+realm+}'s root
pointer will point to the original version until the new
version is guaranteed to be valid.

.. admonition:: Diagram
   :class: note

   The following diagram illustrates the commit process:

   .. figure:: /images/mvcc-diagram.png
      :alt: {+client-database+} copies the relevant part of the tree for writes, then replaces the latest version by updating a pointer.
      :lightbox:

   1. The {+realm+} is structured as a tree. The {+realm+} has a pointer
      to its latest version, V1.

   #. When writing, {+client-database+} creates a new version V2 based on V1.
      {+client-database+} makes copies of objects for modification (A\ :sup:`1`,
      C\ :sup:`1`),  while links to unmodified objects continue to
      point to the original versions (B, D).

   #. After validating the commit, {+client-database+} updates the {+realm+}'s
      pointer to the new latest version, V2. {+client-database+} discards
      old nodes no longer connected to the tree.

{+client-database+} uses :term:`zero-copy` techniques
like memory mapping to handle data. When you read a value
from the {+realm+}, you are virtually looking at the value on
the actual disk, not a copy of it. This is the basis for
:ref:`live objects <ios-live-object>`. This is also why a {+realm+}
head pointer can be set to point to the new version after
the write to disk has been validated.

Summary
-------

- {+service+} enables simple and safe multithreaded code when you follow
  three rules:
  - don't lock to read

  - avoid writes on the UI thread if you write on background threads or
    use :doc:`{+sync+} </sync/sync-overview>`
    
  - don't pass live objects to other threads.

- There is a proper way to share objects across threads for each use case.

- In order to see changes made on other threads in your {+realm+}
  instance, you must manually **refresh** {+realm+} instances that do
  not exist on "loop" threads or that have auto-refresh disabled.

- For apps based on reactive, event-stream-based architectures, you can
  **freeze** objects, collections, and {+realms+} in order to pass
  shallow copies around efficiently to different threads for processing.

- {+client-database+}'s multiversion concurrency control (MVCC)
  architecture is similar to Git's. Unlike Git, {+client-database+} has
  only one true latest version for each {+realm+}.

- {+client-database+} commits in two stages to guarantee isolation and durability.

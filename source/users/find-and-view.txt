Find a User
-----------

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui
      
      To find information about one or more users, click :guilabel:`App Users`
      in the {+leftnav+}. The page opens to the :guilabel:`Users` tab which has
      a list of users associated with your {+app+}:
      
      .. figure:: /images/find.png
         :figwidth: 750px
         :alt: The Users screen in the UI, which shows a filterable list of all users
      
      .. tip::
         
         If you already know the ID of the user you want to find, you can search
         for their ID in the :guilabel:`Users` table search bar.
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli
      
      .. include:: /includes/note-procedure-uses-cli-v2.rst
      
      To find information about one or more users, call ``realm-cli users
      list``. The CLI will prompt you for your App ID and list users in that app
      for you to select.
      
      .. code-block:: bash
         
         realm-cli users list
      
      You can also specify the arguments when you call the program:
      
      .. code-block:: bash
         
         realm-cli users list --app=<Your App ID>

.. _filter-users:

Filter Users
------------

You can specify filters that limit a list of users to a subset of users that
satisfy the filter conditions.

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui
      
      Use the :guilabel:`filter bar` at the top of the :guilabel:`Users` table
      to define filters. You can filter by:
      
      - :guilabel:`Provider type`
        
        - Anonymous
        - Email/Password
        - API Key
        - Facebook
        - Google
        - Apple
        - Custom JWT
        - Custom Function
      
      - :guilabel:`Status`
      
        - Confirmed
        - Pending
      
      - :guilabel:`State`
      
        - Enabled
        - Disabled
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli

      You can filter user operations with the following flags and arguments:
      
      - ``--pending``: If included, lists only pending users. Otherwise, lists only confirmed users.
      
      - ``--state``: Lists only users in the specified state
        
        - ``"enabled"``
        - ``"disabled"``
      
      - ``--provider``:
        
        - ``"anon-user"``
        - ``"local-userpass"``
        - ``"api-key"``
        - ``"oauth2-facebook"``
        - ``"oauth2-google"``
        - ``"oauth2-apple"``
        - ``"custom-token"``
        - ``"custom-function"``
      
      .. example::
         
         The following command limits the output to only :ref:`pending
         <confirm-user>` (unconfirmed) email/password users:
         
         .. code-block:: shell
            
            realm-cli users list --pending --provider="local-userpass"
      
      .. example::
         
         The following command limits the output to only :ref:`disabled
         <disable-user>` users:
         
         .. code-block:: shell
            
            realm-cli users list --state="disabled"

View a User's Devices
---------------------

When a user connects to your application, {+backend+}
:ref:`logs information <authentication-logs>` similar to the following:

.. figure:: /images/devices.png
   :figwidth: 750px
   :alt: A detail view for a specific user that lists devices they've used with your app

Logged information includes:

- The device platform, which will be either an http client
  ("chrome", "firefox", "phantomjs", etc.) or a mobile OS ("ios",
  "android", etc.)
- The platform version.
- Your app version on the device.
- A unique device ID.

To view this information, from the list of users, expand any user and then
expand :guilabel:`Devices`.

.. _view-provider-data:

View a User's Provider Data
---------------------------

Whenever a user connects to your application and authenticates using one
of the authentication providers you have enabled, {+backend+} logs the
provider data.

.. figure:: /images/provider.png
   :figwidth: 750px
   :alt: A detail view for a specific user that lists metadata about them from an authentication provider

You can view this collection of Provider Data from within the list of
users by doing the following:

#. Find a user in the list of users.

#. Expand the user, and then expand the :guilabel:`Provider Data`.

.. _view-user-log:

View a User's Activity Log
--------------------------

{+backend+} logs every request made by each of your {+app+}
users, including executed function calls.  Also, if a function writes to
the log using ``console.log``, ``console.warn``, or ``console.error``,
these entries will be included within the function’s log output.

.. figure:: /images/user_log.png
   :figwidth: 750px
   :alt: A detail view for a specific user that shows a log of their interactions with your app

To view a user's request logs, follow these steps:

#. Select :guilabel:`App Users` from the {+leftnav+}.

#. Under the :guilabel:`Users` tab, find a user in the list and click on the ellipsis (``...``).

#. Click :guilabel:`View activity`. This will redirect you to a log of requests made by that specific user. You can expand an entry to view details for that request.

Summary
-------

- You can search for users in the ``Users`` page of the {+ui+}.

- {+backend+} logs information such as user’s connected devices,
  provider data, and activity log

Find a User
-----------

To find a specific user, click :guilabel:`Users` in the left navigation
pane. The Users page displays with the :guilabel:`Users` tab as the
default view. You will see a list of users associated with your
{+app+}, like this:

   :figwidth: 750px

As the number of users increases, you may find it convenient to filter
the view to a subset of users. To do this, use the :guilabel:`filter bar`
to limit the types of users. You can filter by:

- :guilabel:`Provider type` -- Anonymous, Email/Password, Google,
  Facebook, API Keys, or Custom Authentication
- :guilabel:`Status` -- Enabled or Disabled

Also, the :guilabel:`filter bar` contains a search box, enabling
you to find a specific user by their ID.

View a User's Devices
---------------------

When a user connects to your application, {+backend+}
:ref:`logs information <authentication-logs>` similar to the following:

.. figure:: /images/devices.png
   :figwidth: 750px

Logged information includes:

- The device platform, which will be either an http client
  ("chrome", "firefox", "phantomjs", etc.) or a mobile OS ("ios",
  "android", etc.)
- The platform version.
- Your app version on the device.
- A unique device ID.

To view this information, from the list of :guilabel:`Users`, expand any
user and then expand :guilabel:`Devices`.

.. _view-provider-data:

View a User's Provider Data
---------------------------

Whenever a user connects to your application and authenticates using one
of the authentication providers you have enabled, {+backend+} logs the
provider data.

.. figure:: /images/provider.png
   :figwidth: 750px

You can view this collection of Provider Data from within the list of
:guilabel:`Users` by doing the following:

#. Find a user in the list of :guilabel:`Users`.

#. Expand the user, and then expand the :guilabel:`Provider Data`.

.. _view-user-log:

View a User's Activity Log
--------------------------

{+backend+} logs every request made by each of your {+app+}
users, including executed function calls.  Also, if a function writes to
the log using ``console.log``, ``console.warn``, or ``console.error``,
these entries will be included within the function’s log output.

.. figure:: /images/user_log.png
   :figwidth: 750px

To view a user's request logs, follow these steps:

#. Select :guilabel:`Users` from the left-side navigation.

#. Under the :guilabel:`Users` tab, find a user in the list and click on the ellipsis (``...``).

#. Click :guilabel:`View activity`. This will redirect you to a log of requests made by that specific user. You can expand an entry to view details for that request.


Summary
-------

- You can search for users in the ``Users`` page of the {+ui+}.

- {+backend+} logs information such as user’s connected devices,
  provider data, and activity log

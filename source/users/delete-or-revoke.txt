On the :guilabel:`Users` page, you can manage user accounts. The
Realm console makes it easy to create test user accounts, delete
user accounts, and revoke sessions.

Deleting or Disabling a User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. default-domain:: mongodb

There may be a situation when you need to disable or completely remove a
user from your MongoDB Realm application. To do so, use the following procedure:

#. Select :guilabel:`Users` from the left-hand navigation.

#. Select either :guilabel:`Confirmed` or :guilabel:`Pending`, depending
   on the current state of the user you wish to delete.

#. Under the :guilabel:`Users` tab, find a user in the list and click on
   the ellipsis (``...``).

#. Choose either :guilabel:`Disable User` or :guilabel:`Delete User`.
   Both options invalidate all access tokens and refresh tokens for the
   user, and the user can no longer log in. :guilabel:`Delete User`
   also removes the account from your Realm application. Users
   that have not yet been confirmed cannot be disabled, only deleted.

.. note::

   Deleting a user will not automatically delete any data in your
   MongoDB database that you have associated with that user. For
   example, if you have a ``todo_items`` collection with an
   ``"owner_id"`` field, deleting a user will not automatically delete
   all of their To-Do items. You will need to manually remove those
   documents from your database if you want to fully remove all traces
   of that user.


Revoking User Sessions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Situations may arise where you need to log a particular user out of
all of their :ref:`sessions <user-sessions>`, and prevent them from making
further requests until they reauthenticate. The MongoDB Realm admin console
makes this a straightforward process.

Use the following procedure to revoke all the sessions for a particular
user:

#. Select :guilabel:`Users` from the left-side navigation.

#. Under the :guilabel:`Users` tab, find a user in the list and click on the ellipsis (``...``).

#. Click :guilabel:`Revoke all sessions`. This invalidates all access
   tokens and refresh tokens for that user. This means that to perform
   any further requests in any of their sessions, they will need to
   reauthenticate.

Delete or Disable a User
------------------------

There may be a situation when you need to disable or completely remove a
user from your :term:`{+app+}`. To do so, use the following procedure:

#. Select :guilabel:`Users` from the left-hand navigation.

#. Select either :guilabel:`Confirmed` or :guilabel:`Pending`, depending
   on the current state of the user you wish to delete.

#. Under the :guilabel:`Users` tab, find a user in the list and click on
   the ellipsis (``...``).

#. Choose either :guilabel:`Disable User` or :guilabel:`Delete User`.
   Both options invalidate all access tokens and refresh tokens for the
   user, and the user can no longer log in. :guilabel:`Delete User` also
   removes the account from your {+app+}. Users who are not
   yet confirmed cannot be disabled, only deleted.

.. note::

   Deleting a user will not automatically delete any data in your
   :term:`linked {+atlas+} cluster <linked cluster>` that you have
   associated with that user. For example, if you have a ``todo_items``
   collection with an ``"owner_id"`` field, deleting a user will not
   automatically delete all of their To-Do items. You will need to
   manually remove those documents from your database if you want to
   remove all traces of that user fully.

.. _revoke-user-sessions:

Revoke a User's Sessions
------------------------

Situations may arise where you need to log a particular user out of
all of their :ref:`sessions <user-sessions>` and prevent them from making
further requests until they reauthenticate. The {+service-short+} admin console
makes this a straightforward process.

Use the following procedure to revoke all the sessions for a particular
user:

#. Select :guilabel:`Users` from the left-side navigation.

#. Under the :guilabel:`Users` tab, find a user in the list and click on the ellipsis (``...``).

#. Click :guilabel:`Revoke all sessions`. This invalidates all access
   tokens and refresh tokens for that user, meaning that to perform
   any further requests in any of their sessions, users will need to
   reauthenticate.

Summary
-------

- You can delete or disable {+app+} users through the {+ui+}.

- You can log out {+app+} users from all of their sessions through
  the {+service-short+} admin console.

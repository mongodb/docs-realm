.. _delete-user:

Delete a User
-------------

You can completely remove a user from your application, including any metadata
and authentication provider identities.

.. tip::
   
   If you don't want to delete the user's account, you can :ref:`disable their
   account <disable-user>` to temporarily suspend their access.

      :tabid: ui
      
      #. Select :guilabel:`App Users` from the {+leftnav+}.
      
      #. Select either :guilabel:`Confirmed` or :guilabel:`Pending`, depending
         on the current state of the user you wish to delete.
      
      #. Under the :guilabel:`Users` tab, find a user in the list and click on
         the ellipsis (``...``).
      
      #. Click :guilabel:`Delete User` and confirm your choice.
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli
      
      .. include:: /includes/note-procedure-uses-cli-v2.rst
      
      To delete a user, call ``realm-cli users delete``. The CLI will prompt you
      for your App ID and list users in that app for you to select.
      
      .. code-block:: bash
         
         realm-cli users delete
      
      You can also specify the arguments when you call the program:
      
      .. code-block:: bash
         
         realm-cli users delete \
           --app=<Your App ID> \
           --user=<User ID>
      
      .. tip::
         
         You can delete multiple users with a single command by specifying
         their ``id`` values as a comma-separated list.
         
         .. code-block:: bash
            
            realm-cli users delete --user=6099694d5debcbcc873ff413,60996996b78eca4a8d615d3a

.. note::

   Realm does not automatically delete any data in your :term:`linked {+atlas+}
   cluster <linked cluster>` that you have associated with a deleted user, such
   as by including their ID in an ``owner_id`` field. To remove all traces of a
   deleted user, you must manually delete or modify any such documents.

.. _disable-user:

Disable a User
--------------

You can temporarily disable a user, which prevents the user from logging in and
invalidates any of the user's existing access and refresh tokens. You can
:ref:`enable <enable-user>` a disabled user to let them log in again.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui
      
      #. Select :guilabel:`App Users` from the {+leftnav+}.
      
      #. Select either :guilabel:`Confirmed` or :guilabel:`Pending`, depending
         on the current state of the user you wish to disable.
      
      #. Under the :guilabel:`Users` tab, find a user in the list and click on
         the ellipsis (``...``).
      
      #. Click :guilabel:`Disable User` and confirm your choice.
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli
      
      .. include:: /includes/note-procedure-uses-cli-v2.rst
      
      To disable a user, call ``realm-cli users disable``. The CLI will prompt you
      for your App ID and list users in that app for you to select.
      
      .. code-block:: bash
         
         realm-cli users disable
      
      You can also specify the arguments when you call the program:
      
      .. code-block:: bash
         
         realm-cli users disable \
           --app=<Your App ID> \
           --user=<User ID>
      
      .. tip::
         
         You can disable multiple users with a single command by specifying
         their ``id`` values as a comma-separated list.
         
         .. code-block:: bash
            
            realm-cli users disable --user=6099694d5debcbcc873ff413,60996996b78eca4a8d615d3a

.. _revoke-user-sessions:

Revoke a User's Sessions
------------------------

Situations may arise where you need to log a particular user out of
all of their :ref:`sessions <user-sessions>` and prevent them from making
further requests until they reauthenticate. The {+service-short+} admin console
makes this a straightforward process.

Use the following procedure to revoke all the sessions for a particular
user:

#. Select :guilabel:`App Users` from the {+leftnav+}.

#. Under the :guilabel:`Users` tab, find a user in the list and click on the ellipsis (``...``).

#. Click :guilabel:`Revoke all sessions`. This invalidates all access
   tokens and refresh tokens for that user, meaning that to perform
   any further requests in any of their sessions, users will need to
   reauthenticate.

Summary
-------

- You can delete or disable {+app+} users through the {+ui+}.

- You can log out {+app+} users from all of their sessions through
  the {+service-short+} admin console.

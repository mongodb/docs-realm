Overview
--------

You can store arbitrary data about your application users in a MongoDB
collection and configure {+service+} to automatically expose each user's data
in a field of their :ref:`user object <user-objects>`. For example, you
might store a user's preferred language, date of birth, or their local
timezone.

{+service+} automatically finds a user's custom data document and includes it
in their access token when they log in. You can access the data in the
``custom_data`` field of the user's object in :ref:`function context
<context-get-user-information>`, the :json-expansion:`%%user` expansion,
and their client application access token.

{+service+} does not manage custom user documents so you are responsible for
creating and deleting them. The underlying data is a regular MongoDB
document, so you can use standard CRUD operations through the
:doc:`MongoDB Atlas service </mongodb>` to define and modify a user's
custom data. You can also use :doc:`authentication triggers
</triggers/authentication-triggers>` to dynamically update user
documents, such as storing the time of their most recent login in the
``lastLogin`` field.

.. important:: Store One Document Per User

   Documents that contain user data must include the user's ID in a
   :term:`specific field <user ID field>`. If multiple documents specify
   the same user's ID, {+service+} only exposes the data from the
   document that was inserted first.

Configuration
-------------

{+service+} stores MongoDB documents that correspond to custom user data
in a :term:`linked MongoDB Atlas cluster <linked cluster>`. When you
configure custom user data for your application, you specify:

- the :term:`custom user data cluster`

- the :term:`custom user data database`

- the :term:`custom user data collection` in which custom
  user data documents are stored

- the :term:`user ID field` used to map custom user data documents
  to users (via :term:`user ID`)

Configure Permissions for Custom User Data
------------------------------------------

Because custom user data belongs to a specific user, it could contain
personal or private information depending on the needs of your
application. If your application stores such information in custom user
data, you should restrict access to custom user data appropriately.
While the permissioning model of your custom user data depends on the
needs of your application, consider using one of the following permission
models to restrict read and write access to privileged users only: 

- Make your custom user data readable and writable by only the user
  whose ID matches the :term:`user ID field` of each custom user data
  document. In this permissioning model, the user writes custom user
  data using :ref:`MongoDB Data Access <mongodb-data-access>` or
  :ref:`Sync <sync>`.

- Make your custom user data readable and writable by only a
  :term:`system user <system user>` in a :term:`system function`. Create
  a system function that handles edits to custom user data for a user
  using the ``user.id`` value provided by the :ref:`function context
  <context-user>`. In this permissioning model, the user writes custom
  user data using the :ref:`Functions API <functions>`.

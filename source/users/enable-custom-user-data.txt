Overview
--------

You can store arbitrary data about your application users in a MongoDB
collection and configure {+service+} to automatically expose each user's data
in a field of their :ref:`user object <user-objects>`. For example, you
might store a user's preferred language, date of birth, or their local
timezone.

{+service+} automatically finds a user's custom data document and includes it
in their access token when they log in. You can access the data in the
``custom_data`` field of the user's object in :ref:`function context
<context-get-user-information>`, the :json-expansion:`%%user` expansion,
and their client application access token.

{+service+} does not manage custom user documents so you are responsible for
creating and deleting them. The underlying data is a regular MongoDB
document, so you can use standard CRUD operations through the
:doc:`MongoDB Atlas service </mongodb>` to define and modify a user's
custom data. You can also use :doc:`authentication triggers
</triggers/authentication-triggers>` to dynamically update user
documents, such as storing the time of their most recent login in the
``lastLogin`` field.

   :class: important

   Documents that contain user data must include the user's ID in a
   specific field. If multiple documents specify the same user's ID,
   {+service+} only exposes the data from the document that was inserted
   first.

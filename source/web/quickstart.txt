Overview
--------

This page shows you how to connect the Realm Web SDK to an Atlas App Services
backend, authenticate a user, and work with data. Before you begin, you'll
need to :ref:`create an App <create-a-realm-app>` for your web app to use.

.. _web-quickstart-install:

Install the Web SDK
-------------------

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: npm
      :tabid: npm

      .. code-block:: shell

         npm install realm-web

   .. tab:: yarn
      :tabid: yarn

      .. code-block:: shell

         yarn add realm-web

   .. tab:: CDN
      :tabid: CDN

      Add a ``<script>`` tag to the ``<head>`` of your HTML file to load
      the Realm Web SDK as a global variable from a content delivery
      network.

      Use the most recent version:

      .. code-block:: html

         <script src="https://unpkg.com/realm-web/dist/bundle.iife.js"></script>

      Or import a specific version:

      .. code-block:: html

         <script src="https://unpkg.com/realm-web@1.5.1/dist/bundle.iife.js"></script>

.. _web-quickstart-import-realm:

Import the Web SDK
------------------

Near the top of any JavaScript or TypeScript file that uses Realm, add the
following import statement:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/web/quick-start.test.snippet.import-realm.js
   :language: javascript

.. note::
   
   If you loaded the SDK using a ``<script>`` tag then you don't need to import
   the SDK to use it. Instead, you can access it using the global ``Realm``
   variable.

.. _web-quickstart-init-app:

Initialize the App
------------------

To use App Services features such as user authentication and functions, you must
access your App using your App ID. You can find your App ID in the App Services UI.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/web/quick-start.test.snippet.initialize-realm-app.js
   :language: javascript

.. _web-quickstart-authenticate:

Authenticate a User
-------------------

When :ref:`anonymous authentication <anonymous-authentication>` is enabled,
users can log into your app without providing any identifying information:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/web/quick-start.test.snippet.authenticate-user.js
   :language: javascript

App Services provides many additional ways to authenticate, register, and
link users.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`Authenticate a User <web-authenticate>`
.. _web-quickstart-function:

Call a Function
---------------

To call a :ref:`function <functions>`, use the ``Realm.User.functions``
interface to :ref:`call your serverless functions <web-call-a-function>` as if
they were regular JavaScript functions defined on the object.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/web/quick-start.test.snippet.call-a-function.js
   :language: javascript

.. _web-use-graphql:

Use the GraphQL API
-------------------

To execute CRUD operations and call custom resolvers through the :ref:`GraphQL
API <graphql-api>`, we recommend that you use a third-party GraphQL library such
as :ref:`Apollo Client <graphql-apollo-react>`. To authenticate your GraphQL
request, include a valid user token in the Authorization header of the request.

.. seealso::
  - :doc:`Apollo Client (React) </web/graphql-apollo-react>`
  - :ref:`Run GraphQL Operations from a CLI <graphql-cli>`

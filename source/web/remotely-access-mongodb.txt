Overview
--------

You can query data stored in MongoDB directly from your client
application code with the MongoDB query language by using MongoDB
Realm's :js-sdk:`RemoteMongoDB <Realm-RemoteMongoDB.html>`. MongoDB
Realm provides data access :ref:`rules <mongodb-rules>` for collections
to securely retrieve results based on the logged-in user or the content
of each document.


Prerequisites
-------------

Before you can remotely access MongoDB, you must:

- Have a :term:`linked Atlas cluster <linked cluster>` 


Example: Query For Data in Your Collection
------------------------------------------

The following example is an HTML file. After setting your Realm app ID
in the code, you can open the file in a browser and check the console.

.. note::

   The following code snippet requires that :ref:`Anonymous
   Authentication <anonymous-authentication>` is enabled in your MongoDB
   Realm App.

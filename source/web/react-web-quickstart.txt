Realm - React Quickstart
========================

This guide shows you how to set up a basic React web application that connects
to your Atlas App Services backend and authenticates an anonymous user.

We put together a finished version of this quickstart on CodeSandbox. All you
have to do is paste in your Realm App ID to connect to your app.

- `JavaScript CodeSandbox <https://codesandbox.io/s/realm-web-react-quickstart-rd8j2?file=/src/App.js>`__
- `TypeScript CodeSandbox <https://codesandbox.io/s/realm-web-react-ts-quickstart-wb0f4?file=/src/App.tsx>`__

Prerequisites
-------------

- This guide assumes that you have already :ref:`created an Atlas App Services
  backend <create-a-realm-app>` and :ref:`enabled anonymous
  authentication <anonymous-authentication>`.

- To create and run this application you will need :npm:`npm <>` installed on
  your machine.

- The `create-react-app <https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/>`__
  documentation recommends that you install :npm:`npx <package/npx>` to run
  ``create-react-app`` rather than using a version that's installed on your
  machine.

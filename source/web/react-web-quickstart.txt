MongoDB Realm - React Quickstart
================================

This guide shows you how to set up a basic React web application that connects
to your MongoDB Realm app and authenticates an anonymous user.

We put together a finished version of this quickstart on CodeSandbox. All you
have to do is paste in your Realm App ID to connect to your app.

- `JavaScript CodeSandbox <https://codesandbox.io/s/realm-web-react-quickstart-rd8j2?file=/src/App.js>`__
- `TypeScript CodeSandbox <https://codesandbox.io/s/realm-web-react-ts-quickstart-wb0f4?file=/src/App.tsx>`__

Prerequisites
-------------

- This guide assumes that you have already :doc:`created a MongoDB Realm
  application </procedures/create-realm-app>` and :doc:`enabled anonymous
  authentication </authentication/anonymous>`.

- To create and run this application you will need :npm:`npm <>` installed on
  your machine.

- The `create-react-app <https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/>`__
  documentation recommends that you install :npm:`npx <package/npx>` to run
  ``create-react-app`` rather than using a version that's installed on your
  machine.

.. _web-create-user:

Create a User
-------------

For most :ref:`authentication methods <authentication-providers>`, Realm 
automatically creates a :ref:`user object <user-objects>` the first time 
a user authenticates. The only exception is email/password authentication. 
When you use email/password authentication, you must :ref:`register 
<web-email-password-register-new-user>` and :ref:`confirm 
<web-email-password-complete-confirmation>` a user before the user can 
authenticate to a Realm application.

.. _web-delete-user:

Delete a User
-------------

.. versionadded:: 1.7.0

Call your {+app+}'s ``.deleteUser()`` method on a user object to delete 
the user object from your Realm application. This deletes the object from
the server in addition to clearing local data.

.. important:: Deleting All User Data

   Deleting a user only deletes the user object, which may contain associated 
   metadata from the associated auth provider. This does not delete :ref:`custom 
   user data <web-access-custom-user-data>` or user-entered data from your 
   application.

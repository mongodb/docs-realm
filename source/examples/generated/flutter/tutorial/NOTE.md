# Note on modifications here

Note that the files in this folder have been slightly modified from the Bluehawk state.
They also have their file names to include `.modified` to reflect this.

Modifications:

- For some reason Bluehawk isn't capturing that the files are `dart` in the heading.
  This has been updated.
- I've also added a `:caption:` to show file name for clarity in the tutorial.

Also, for reasons I don't fully comprehend, Bluehawk didn't create the `.. code-block::`
directive or .rst file for `init_realm.snippet.base-version.dart`, so I'm just
using a `.. literalinclude::` to add it to the docs.

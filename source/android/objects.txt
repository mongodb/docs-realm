Overview
--------

{+service+} applications model data as objects composed of field-value pairs
that each contain one or more primitive data types or other {+service-short+}
objects. :term:`{+service-short+} objects <Realm object>` are essentially the same
as regular objects, but they also include
additional features like
:ref:`real-time updating data views <android-live-object>` and reactive
:ref:`change event handlers <android-client-notifications>`.

Every {+service-short+} object has an *object type* that refers to the object's
class. Objects of the same type share an :ref:`object schema
<android-object-schema>` that defines the properties and relationships of those
objects. In most languages you define object schemas using the native
class implementation.

.. example::

   The following code block shows an object schema that describes a Dog.
   Every Dog object must include a ``name`` and ``age`` and may
   optionally include the dog's ``breed`` and a reference to a Person
   object that represents the dog's ``owner``.

Key Concepts
------------

.. _android-live-object:

Live Object
~~~~~~~~~~~

Objects in {+service-short+} clients are **live objects** that
update automatically to reflect data changes, including
:doc:`synced </sync>` remote changes, and emit
:ref:`notification events <android-client-notifications>` that you
can subscribe to whenever their underlying data changes. You
can use live objects to work with object-oriented data
natively without an :wikipedia:`ORM
<Object-relational_mapping>` tool.

Live objects are direct proxies to the underlying stored data, which
means that a live object doesn't directly contain data. Instead, a live
object always references the most up-to-date data on disk and
:wikipedia:`lazy loads <Lazy_loading>` property values when you access
them from a :ref:`collection <android-client-collections>`. This means that a
{+realm+} can contain many objects but only pay the performance cost for
data that the application is actually using.

Valid write operations on a live object automatically persist to the
{+realm+} and propagate to any other synced clients. You do not need to
call an update method, modify the {+realm+}, or otherwise "push" updates.

.. _android-object-schema:

Object Schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An **object schema** is a configuration object that defines the fields,
relationships of a {+service-short+} object type. {+service-short+} client applications
define object schemas with the native class implementation in their
respective language using the :term:`{+frontend-schema+}`.

Object schemas specify constraints on object properties such as the data
type of each property, whether or not a property is required, and the
default value for optional properties. Schemas can also define
:ref:`relationships <android-client-relationships>` between object types in
a {+realm+}.

Every {+app+} has a :ref:`{+backend-schema+} <android-realm-schema>`
composed of a list of object schemas for each type of object that the
{+realms+} in that application may contain.

{+service+} guarantees that all objects in a {+realm+} conform to the
schema for their object type and validates objects whenever they're
created, modified, or deleted.

.. _android-primary-key:

Primary Key
~~~~~~~~~~~

A **primary key** is a String or Integer property that uniquely
identifies an object. You may optionally define a primary key for an
object type as part of the :ref:`object schema <android-object-schema>`.
{+client-database+} automatically indexes primary key properties, which
allows you to efficiently read and modify objects based on their primary
key.

If an object type has a primary key, then all objects of that type must
include the primary key property with a value that is unique among
objects of the same type in a {+realm+}. You cannot change the primary
key property for an object type after any object of that type is added
to a {+realm+}.

.. _android-property-schema:

Property Schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **property schema** is a field-level configuration that defines and
constrains a specific property in an object schema. Every object schema
must include a property schema for each property in the object. At
minimum, a property schema defines a property's data type and indicates
whether or not the property is required.

You can configure the following constraints for a given property:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Parameter
     - Description

   * - Type
     - Every property in a {+service-short+} object has a strongly defined data
       type. A property's type can be a primitive data type or an object
       type defined in the same {+realm+}. The type also specifies whether
       the property contains a single value or a list of values.

       {+client-database+} supports the following primitive data types:

       - Boolean
       - Integer
       - Double
       - String
       - Date
       - Data
       - Decimal128 from ``org.bson.types``
       - ObjectId from ``org.bson.types``

   * - Optional
     - Optional properties may contain a null value or be entirely
       omitted from an object. By default, all properties are required
       unless explicitly marked as optional.

   * - Default
     - If a client application creates a new object that does not have a
       value for a defined property, the object uses the default value
       instead.

       Objects that are missing a required field without a defined
       default value will fail validation when you attempt to create
       them and will not persist to the {+realm+}.

   * - Indexed
     - A property index significantly increases the speed of certain
       read operations at the cost of additional overhead for write
       operations. Indexes are particularly useful for equality
       comparison, such as querying for an object based on the value of
       a property.

Summary
-------

- {+service-short+} objects are of a **type** defined as you would any other
  class.

- {+service-short+} objects are **live**: they always reflect the latest version
  on disk and update automatically when the underlying object changes.

- A {+service-short+} object type may have a **primary key** property to uniquely
  identify each instance of the object type.

- The {+service-short+} object's **schema** defines the properties of the object and
  which properties are optional, which properties have a default value,
  and which properties are indexed.

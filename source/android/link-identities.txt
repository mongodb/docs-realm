Link User Identities
====================

Overview
--------

{+service+} provides :ref:`multiple ways <authentication-providers>` for
users to log into your application. Because each method of authentication
corresponds to a unique user identity, {+service-short+} lets you merge
multiple identities corresponding to a single user into one user
identity.

Example
-------

For instance, consider an application that enables users to authenticate
via :ref:`anonymous authentication <anonymous-authentication>` so they
may explore functionality without linking to an existing
SSO provider or generating a new password. When that user decides to
finally create a full account with an SSO provider or email/password
authentication, you need some way of persisting the user's original
anonymous identity with their new permanent identity.

You can link identities using the ``linkCredentials()`` or
``linkCredentialsAsync()`` methods of the ``User`` object of a logged in
User.

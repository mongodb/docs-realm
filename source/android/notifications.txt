Overview
--------

Any modern app should be able to react when data changes,
regardless of where that change originated. When a user adds
a new item to a list, you may want to update the UI, show a
notification, or log a message. When someone updates that
item, you may want to change its visual state or fire off a
network request. Finally, when someone deletes the item, you
probably want to remove it from the UI. {+service+}'s notification
system allows you to watch for and react to changes in your
data, independent of the writes that caused the changes.

{+service-short+} emits three kinds of notifications:

- :ref:`Realm notifications <android-realm-notifications>` whenever a specific {+realm+} commits a write transaction.
- :ref:`Collection notifications <android-collection-notifications>` whenever any :term:`{+service-short+} object` in a collection changes, including inserts, updates, and deletes.
- :ref:`Object notifications <android-object-notifications>` whenever a specific {+service-short+} object changes, including updates and deletes.

.. _android-subscribe-to-changes:

Subscribe to Changes
--------------------

Generally, this is how you observe a {+realm+}, collection, or object:

1. Create a notification handler for the {+realm+}, collection, or object notification.
2. Add the notification handler to the {+realm+}, collection, or object that you want to observe.
3. Receive a notification token from the call to add the handler. Retain this token as long as you want to observe.
4. When you are done observing, invalidate the token.

.. _android-realm-notifications:

Realm Notifications
-------------------
You can register a notification handler on an entire {+realm+}.
{+client-database+} calls the notification handler whenever any write
transaction involving that {+realm+} is committed. The
handler receives no information about the change.

This is useful when you want to know that there has been a
change but do not care to know specifically what changed.
For example, proof of concept apps often use this
notification type and simply refresh the entire UI when
anything changes. As the app becomes more sophisticated and
performance-sensitive, the app developers shift to more
granular notifications.

.. example::

  Suppose you are writing a real-time collaborative app. To
  give the sense that your app is buzzing with collaborative
  activity, you want to have an indicator that lights up when
  any change is made. In that case, a realm notification
  handler would be a great way to drive the code that controls
  the indicator.

.. _android-collection-notifications:

Collection Notifications
------------------------

You can register a notification handler on a specific
collection within a {+realm+}. The handler receives a
description of changes since the last notification.
Specifically, this description consists of three lists of
indices:

- The indices of the objects that were deleted.
- The indices of the objects that were inserted.
- The indices of the objects that were modified.

.. important:: Order Matters

   In collection notification handlers, always apply changes
   in the following order: deletions, insertions, then
   modifications. Handling insertions before deletions may
   result in unexpected behavior.

{+client-database+} emits an initial notification after retrieving the
collection. After that, {+client-database+} delivers collection
notifications asynchronously whenever a write transaction
adds, changes, or removes objects in the collection.

Unlike {+realm+} notifications, collection notifications contain
detailed information about the change. This enables
sophisticated and selective reactions to changes. Collection
notifications provide all the information needed to manage a
list or other view that represents the collection in the UI.

.. example::

  The following code shows how to observe a collection for
  changes in order to update the UI.

.. _android-object-notifications:

Object Notifications
--------------------

You can register a notification handler on a specific object
within a {+realm+}. {+client-database+} notifies your handler:

- When the object is deleted.
- When any of the object's properties change.

The handler receives information about what fields changed
and whether the object was deleted.

.. example::

  The following code shows how to open a default realm, create
  a new instance of a class, and observe that instance for
  changes.

Summary
-------

- Notifications allow you to watch for and react to changes on your objects, collections, and {+realm+}s.
- When you add a notification handler to an object, collection, or {+realm+} that you wish to observe, you receive a token. Retain this token as long as you wish to keep observing.
- {+client-database+} has three notification types: {+realm+}, collection, and object notifications. Realm notifications only tell you that something changed, while collection and object notifications allow for more granular observation.

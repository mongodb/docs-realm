Overview
--------

To filter data in your {+realm+}, you can leverage
{+client-database+}'s query engine. {+client-database+}'s
query engine uses a :wikipedia:`Fluent interface
<Fluent_interface>` to construct multi-clause queries. See
`RealmQuery API
<https://realm.io/docs/java/latest/api/io/realm/RealmQuery.html>`__
for a complete list of available methods.


Operators
---------

There are several types of operators available to filter a
:ref:`Realm collection <android-client-collections>`.
Filters work by **evaluating** an operator expression for
every :term:`object <Realm object>` in the collection being
filtered. If the expression resolves to ``true``, Realm
Database includes the object in the results collection.

An **expression** consists of one of the following:

- The name of a property of the object currently being evaluated.
- An operator and up to two argument expression(s).
- A literal string, number, or date.

.. note:: About the examples on this page

   The examples in this page use a simple data set for a
   task list app. The two Realm object types are ``Project``
   and ``Task``. A ``Task`` has a name, assignee's name, and
   completed flag. There is also an arbitrary number for
   priority -- higher is more important -- and a count of
   minutes spent working on it. A ``Project`` has zero or more
   ``Tasks``.

   See the schema for these two classes, ``Project`` and
   ``Task``, below:

Comparison Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most straightforward operation in a search is to compare
values.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - ``between``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand numerical or date expression is between or equal to the right-hand range. For dates, this evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand date is within the right-hand date range.

   * - | ``equalTo``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand expression is equal to the right-hand expression.

   * - | ``greaterThan``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand numerical or date expression is greater than the right-hand numerical or date expression. For dates, this evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand date is later than the right-hand date.

   * - | ``greaterThanOrEqualTo``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand numerical or date expression is greater than or equal to the right-hand numerical or date expression. For dates, this evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand date is later than or the same as the right-hand date.

   * - ``in``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand expression is in the right-hand list.

   * - | ``lessThan``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand numerical or date expression is less than the right-hand numerical or date expression. For dates, this evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand date is earlier than the right-hand date.

   * - | ``lessThanOrEqualTo``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand numeric expression is less than or equal to the right-hand numeric expression. For dates, this evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand date is earlier than or the same as the right-hand date.

   * - | ``notEqualTo``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand expression is not equal to the right-hand expression.

.. example::

   The following example uses the query engine's
   comparison operators to:

   - Find high priority tasks by comparing the value of the ``priority`` property value with a threshold number, above which priority can be considered high.
   - Find just-started or short-running tasks by seeing if the ``progressMinutes`` property falls within a certain range.
   - Find unassigned tasks by finding tasks where the ``assignee`` property is equal to ``null``.
   - Find tasks assigned to specific teammates Ali or Jamie by seeing if the ``assignee`` property is in a list of names.

Logical Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can make compound predicates using logical operators.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - | ``and``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if both left-hand and right-hand expressions are ``true``.

   * - | ``not``
     - Negates the result of the given expression.

   * - | ``or``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if either expression returns ``true``.

.. example::

   We can use the query language's logical operators to find
   all of Ali's completed tasks. That is, we find all tasks
   where the ``assignee`` property value is equal to 'Ali' AND
   the ``isComplete`` property value is ``true``:

          .. literalinclude:: /examples/Query/Logical.java

      .. tab::
          :tabid: kotlin

          .. literalinclude:: /examples/Query/Logical.kt
            :language: kotlin

String Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can compare string values using these string operators.
Regex-like wildcards allow more flexibility in search.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 60

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - | ``beginsWith``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string expression begins with the right-hand string expression. This is similar to ``contains``, but only matches if the left-hand string expression is found at the beginning of the right-hand string expression.

   * - ``contains``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string expression is found anywhere in the right-hand string expression.

   * - | ``endsWith``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string expression ends with the right-hand string expression. This is similar to ``contains``, but only matches if the left-hand string expression is found at the very end of the right-hand string expression.

   * - | ``like``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string expression
       matches the right-hand string wildcard string
       expression. A wildcard string expression is a string
       that uses normal characters with two special wildcard
       characters:

       - The ``*`` wildcard matches zero or more of any character
       - The ``?`` wildcard matches any character.

       For example, the wildcard string "d?g" matches "dog",
       "dig", and "dug", but not "ding", "dg", or "a dog".

   * - | ``equalTo``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string is lexicographically equal to the right-hand string.


.. example::

   We use the query engine's string operators to find
   projects with a name starting with the letter 'e' and
   projects with names that contain 'ie':

          :tabid: kotlin

          .. literalinclude:: /examples/Query/String.kt
             :language: kotlin

Aggregate Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can apply an aggregate operator to a collection property
of a Realm object. Aggregate operators traverse a
:ref:`collection <android-client-collections>` and reduce it
to a single value.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 60

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - | ``average``
     - Evaluates to the average value of a given numerical property across a collection.

   * - | ``count``
     - Evaluates to the number of objects in the given collection.

   * - | ``max``
     - Evaluates to the highest value of a given numerical property across a collection.

   * - | ``min``
     - Evaluates to the lowest value of a given numerical property across a collection.

   * - | ``sum``
     - Evaluates to the sum of a given numerical property across a collection.

.. example::

   We create a couple of filters to show different facets of
   the data:

   - Projects with average tasks priority above 5.
   - Long running projects.

Summary
-------

- There are several categories of **operators** available to filter results: comparison, logical, string and aggregate operators.

Overview
--------

A **{+realm+}** is a set of related objects that conform to a pre-defined
schema and share user-level access permissions. Realms may contain more
than one type of data as long as a schema exists for each type.

A {+realm+} allows you to partition data according to who
uses it and when they use it. Every {+realm+} stores data in
a separate :term:`{+realm+} file` that contains a binary
encoding of each object in the {+realm+}. You can
automatically :doc:`synchronize {+realm+} across multiple
devices </sync>` and set up :ref:`reactive
event handlers <android-realm-notifications>` that call a
function any time an object in a {+realm+} is created,
modified, or deleted.

Comparison with Other Databases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The {+service+} data model is similar to both relational and document
databases but has distinct differences from both. To underscore these
differences, it's helpful to highlight what a {+realm+} **is not**:

A {+realm+} is not a single, application-wide database.
    Unlike other applications, which store all of their data in a single
    database, {+app+}s often split data across multiple {+realms+} to
    organize data more efficiently and to enforce access controls.

A {+realm+} is not a table.
    Tables typically only store one kind of information, such as street
    addresses or items in a store inventory, whereas a {+realm+} can contain
    any number of object types.

A {+realm+} is not a collection of schemaless documents.
    Application objects are similar to documents, but every object in a
    {+realm+} conforms to a defined schema for its object type. An object
    cannot contain a field that is not described by its schema.

Key Concepts
------------

.. _android-realm-schema:

Realm Schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **{+backend-schema+}** is a list of valid :ref:`object schemas
<android-realm-objects>` that each define an object type that a {+app+}
may persist. All objects in a {+realm+} must conform to the {+backend-schema+}.

Client applications provide a {+frontend-schema+} when they open a
{+realm+}. If a {+realm+} already contains data, then {+client-database+}
validates each existing object to ensure that an object schema was
provided for its type and that it meets all of the constraints specified
in the schema.

.. example::
   
   A {+realm+} that contains basic data about books in libraries might use a
   schema like the following:
   
   .. code-block:: json
      
      [
        {
          "type": "Library",
          "properties": {
            "address": "string",
            "books": "Book[]"
          }
        },
        {
          "type": "Book",
          "primaryKey": "isbn",
          "properties": {
            "isbn": "string",
            "title": "string",
            "author": "string",
            "numberOwned": { "type": "int?", "default": 0 },
            "numberLoaned": { "type": "int?", "default": 0 }
          }
        }
      ]

.. _android-schema-version:

Schema Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **schema version** identifies the state of a :ref:`{+backend-schema+}
<android-realm-schema>` at some point in time. {+client-database+} tracks the schema
version of each {+realm+} and uses it to map the objects in each {+realm+}
to the correct schema.

Schema versions are ascending integers that you can optionally include
in the {+realm+} configuration when you open a {+realm+}. If a client
application does not specify a version number when it opens a {+realm+} then
the {+realm+} defaults to version ``0``.

.. important:: Increment Versions Monotonically
   
   :ref:`Migrations <android-client-migrations>` must update
   a {+realm+} to a higher schema version.
   {+client-database+} will throw an error if a client
   application opens a {+realm+} with a schema version that
   is lower than the {+realm+}'s current version or if the
   specified schema version is the same as the {+realm+}'s
   current version but includes different :ref:`object
   schemas <android-object-schema>`.

.. _android-realm-permissions:

Realm Permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **permission** is a boolean flag that indicates that a user is
authorized to access, modify, or manage a {+realm+}. Permissions are defined
individually for each {+realm+} and either apply to a specific user or
configure the default permission for all users that don't have
permissions specified on the {+realm+}.

All {+realms+} are private by default, which means that the owner has full
permissions and no other user has any permissions unless explicitly
granted by the owner or a user with manage permissions on the {+realm+}.

{+service+} supports the following permissions:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Permission
     - Description

   * - ``mayRead``
     - If ``true``, the user has read access to all objects in the
       {+realm+}.
       
       Read access does not imply write access, so a user may not
       be able to modify a {+realm+} that they can read.

   * - ``mayWrite``
     - If ``true``, the user has read and write access to all objects in
       the {+realm+}.
       
       Write access requires read access, so the ``mayWrite``
       permission also sets ``mayRead`` to ``true`` for the user.

   * - ``mayManage``
     - If ``true``, the user has read and write access to all objects in
       the {+realm+} and can set permissions on the {+realm+} for other users.
       
       Manage access requires write access, so the ``mayManage``
       permission also sets ``mayWrite`` and ``mayRead`` to ``true`` for
       the user.

.. _android-realm-path:

Realms are Partitions of Atlas Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each {+realm+} corresponds to a subset of the data in your
:term:`{+app+}'s <{+app+}>`
:term:`synced {+atlas+} cluster <synced cluster>`. You can customize the
:ref:`partitioning <partitioning>` of data using your application's
:ref:`partition key <partition-keys>`. Unique values of the partition
key, known as :term:`partition values <partition value>`, correspond to
individual {+realms+}.

You can customize permissions for these partitions of data using
:ref:`{+service-short+} Rules <sync-rules>`.

.. _android-realm-modules:

Realm Modules
-------------

{+service-short+} modules are collections of {+service-short+} object
models. You can selectively include invidual modules when opening a
{+realm+}.

.. note::
   
   Libraries that include {+client-database+} must expose and use their
   schema through a module. Doing so prevents the library from
   generating the default ``RealmModule``, which would conflict with
   the default ``RealmModule`` used by any app that includes the library.
   Apps using the library access library classes through the module:

Summary
-------

- A :term:`{+realm+}` is a collection of objects that conform to a
  schema. It is not a single, application-wide database. There can and
  usually will be more than one {+realm+} per application.

- A :term:`{+backend-schema+}` is a versioned specification of the
  object types used in a {+app+}.

- {+service-short+} Rules define who can read or write
  the {+realm+} and apply to the {+realm+} as a whole.

- A :term:`partition value` is a {+realm+}'s unique identifier.

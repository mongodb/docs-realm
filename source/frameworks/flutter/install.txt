Use Atlas Device SDK in a Flutter project to build cross-platform
applications with Flutter and Dart. This guide provides instructions for
installing the SDK in a Flutter project. For details about installing the SDK
in a standalone Dart project, refer to
:ref:`sdks-install`.

Requirements
------------

Install Flutter with Dart in your development environment. The Flutter
installation includes Dart. To learn how, refer to the official
`Flutter Installation Guide <https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install>`__.

When building a project with Flutter, the SDK requires the following minimum
versions:

- Flutter version {+flutter-minimum-version+} or later.
- Dart version {+dart-minimum-version+} or later.

Supported Platforms

Install the SDK
---------------

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Create a Project

      To create a Flutter project, run the following commands:

      .. code-block:: bash

         flutter create <app_name>
         cd <app_name>

      For more information, refer to Flutter's `Get Started Guide
      <https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/test-drive?tab=terminal>`__.

   .. step:: Add the SDK to the Project

      To add the Flutter SDK to your project, run the following command:

      .. code-block:: bash

         flutter pub add realm

      This downloads the `realm <https://pub.dev/packages/realm>`__
      package, and adds it to your project.

      In your ``pubspec.yaml`` file, you should see:

      .. code-block:: yaml
         :caption: pubspec.yaml

         dependencies:
           realm: <latest_version>

      .. note:: Using Networking in your macOS App

         If you are developing with Flutter in the macOS App Sandbox and
         require network access, you must enable network entitlements in your
         app. By default, network requests are not allowed due to built-in
         macOS security settings.

         To learn how to change your app's macOS entitlements, refer to
         :ref:`Device Sync and App Sandbox Entitlements
         <sdks-macos-flutter-app-sandbox-entitlements>`.

Import the SDK
--------------

To use the SDK in your app, import the package into any files that use it:

.. code-block:: dart
   :caption: ExampleFile.dart

   import 'package:realm/realm.dart';

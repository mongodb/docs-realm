The ``@realm/react`` library offers custom React components that eliminate the boilerplate needed to
develop a React app using JavaScript-based Atlas Device SDKs. The components leverage the provider design pattern to manage your Atlas
connection, user creation and authentication, and data management.

- ``RealmProvider``: Work with the configured :js-sdk:`Realm <classes/Realm-1.html>`.

- ``AppProvider``: Connect to your :js-sdk:`App Services App Client <classes/Realm.App-1.html>`.

- ``UserProvider``: Access the logged-in :js-sdk:`user object <classes/Realm.User.html>`.

The providers are available in all SDKs that support a React environment. This includes React
Native, Web, and Electron.

Getting Started with Providers
------------------------------

Like all React components, you call providers using HTML opening and closing tags. Nesting a
component within another component's tags creates a parent-child relationship between them,
where child components can access the context created by their parent component. 

Context refers to the information made accessible by a provider. For example, the
``RealmProvider`` context is the Realm it connects to, so all components nested in the
``RealmProvider`` have access to that Realm.

Props
~~~~~

Components take parameters called props as input, passed into the opening tag. The props passed
into a parent component help create the context inherited by the components it wraps. Each
Provider has different props you can use for configuration.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: RealmProvider Props
      :tabid: realm-provider-props

      All properties of :realm-react-sdk:`BaseConfiguration <types/Realm.BaseConfiguration.html>` can be passed as props.

      The most common BaseConfiguration properties used are:

      - ``schema?: (RealmObjectConstructor<AnyRealmObject> | ObjectSchema)[]``

        Specifies all the object schemas in the Realm. Required when first creating a Realm.
        If omitted, the schema will be read from the existing Realm file.

      - ``sync?: SyncConfiguration``

        Defines Device Sync behavior for this realm, including initial subscriptions.

      ``RealmProvider`` has more props that define its behavior:

      - ``fallback?: React.ComponentType<unknown> | React.ReactElement | null | undefined``

        The fallback component to render while the Realm is opening or if the Realm fails to open.

      - ``closeOnUnmount?: boolean``

        Default is ``true``. If set to ``false``, the open realm will not close when the
        component unmounts.

      - ``realmRef?: React.MutableRefObject<Realm | null>``

        A ref to the Realm instance. This is useful if you need to access the Realm
        instance outside of the scope of the Realm.
      
      - ``children: React.ReactNode``

   .. tab:: AppProvider Props
      :tabid: app-provider-props

      All properties of :realm-react-sdk:`AppConfiguration 
      <types/Realm.AppConfiguration.html>` can be passed as props to ``AppProvider``.

      The most common AppConfiguration property used is:

      - ``id: string``

        Specifies the App Services App ID.

   .. tab:: UserProvider Props
      :tabid: user-provider-props

      - ``fallback?: React.ComponentType<unknown> | React.ReactElement | null | undefined``

        The fallback component to render if there is no authorized user. This can be
        used to render a log in screen or otherwise handle authentication.

Configure your Providers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your app's needs determine what providers you use, as all three providers are not always
necessary. 

This section details how to configure and expose a single Realm using a ``RealmProvider``
imported directly from ``@realm/react``. 
For information about using ``createRealmContext()`` to configure a Realm or exposing more
than one Realm, see "Create Context with createRealmContext()" below.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Configure a Realm with sync
      :tabid: configure-sync-realm

      If you are developing an app using Device Sync, you will need to use all three providers. 

      By default, Atlas syncs all data from the server before returning anything. If you want
      to sync data in the background, read :ref:`Configure a Synced Realm While Offline
      <react-native-open-synced-realm-offline>`.

      To configure a synced realm:

      1. Import ``RealmProvider``, ``AppProvider``, and ``UserProvider`` from ``@realm/react``.
      
      2. Configure ``AppProvider``.

         a. Pass your App Services App ID string to the ``id`` prop of the ``AppProvider``. 
      
      3. Configure ``UserProvider`` and nest it within ``AppProvider``.
        
         a. Pass a component that logs in a user to the ``fallback`` prop. The app renders this component if there is no authenticated user.
      
      4. Configure ``RealmProvider`` for Device Sync and nest it within ``UserProvider``.

         a. Pass your object models to the ``schema`` prop.

         b. Pass your sync properties into the ``sync`` prop. Your sync properties are formatted like a json dictionary.

         c. Add other configuration object properties as props to ``RealmProvider``.

         d. To sync data, you must set up a sync subscription. The example below uses an initial subscription,
            but you can also set up subscriptions in ``RealmProvider`` child components.

      Once your providers have been configured, nest your app components within the
      ``RealmProvider``. The rendering of each component is dependent on the successful
      execution of its parent components' functionality. For example, if ``AppProvider`` cannot
      connect to your app's App Services backend, the components it wraps will not render.
      
      You *must* nest the providers and app components as shown below to ensure each component
      has access to its required context:

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/react-native/ts/configure-realm-sync.test.snippet.configure-realm-sync-full.tsx
        :language: javascript

   .. tab:: Configure realm without sync
      :tabid: configure-non-sync-realm

      If you are developing an app without sync, you only need to use ``RealmProvider``.

      To configure a non-synced realm:
      
      #. Import ``RealmProvider`` from ``@realm/react``.

      #. Pass your object models to the ``schema`` prop.

      #. Add other Configuration object properties as props to ``RealmProvider``

      Once your ``RealmProvider`` has been configured, nest your app components within it to
      give them access to the realm opened. 

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/react-native/ts/configure-realm-local.test.snippet.configure-realm.tsx
        :language: typescript

Working with Providers using Hooks
----------------------------------

To use the provider's context in your app's components, you can use Hooks.

Hooks act as functions used to access states in your app. React offers built-in hooks you can
use either on their own or to build custom  Hooks.

There are two important rules to consider when working with hooks:

- Hooks can only be used at the top level of a React component.
- Hooks can only be called in a React component or a custom hook, not in regular JavaScript
  functions.

The ``@realm/react`` library has custom Hooks for each provider you can
use to access a provider's context in the components it wraps.

RealmProvider Hooks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _sdks-react-use-realm-hook:

useRealm()
``````````

.. code:: typescript
   :copyable: false
   :caption: Type signature

   useRealm(): Realm 

The ``useRealm()`` hook returns an opened :js-sdk:`realm instance<classes/Realm-1.html>`. The realm instance
gives you access to realm methods and properties. For example, you can call
``realm.write()`` to add a realm object to your realm.

To learn more about modifying Realm data, refer to :ref:`Write Transactions
<react-native-write-transactions>`.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/react-native/ts/create-test.test.snippet.crud-create-object.tsx
   :language: typescript
   :emphasize-lines: 3, 6-8, 15

*Returns*

- ``Realm``
Returns a realm instance. This is the realm created by the hook's parent,
``RealmProvider``.

.. _sdks-react-use-object-hook:

useObject()
```````````

.. code:: typescript
   :copyable: false
   :caption: Type signature

   useObject<T>(type, primaryKey): T & Realm.Object<T> | null

The ``useObject()`` hook returns a :js-sdk:`Realm object <classes/Realm.Object.html>` for a given
:ref:`primary key <react-native-primary-keys>`. You can pass an object class
or the class name as a string and the primary key.

The ``useObject()`` method returns null if the object doesn't exist or you have
deleted it. The hook will automatically subscribe to updates and rerender the
component using the hook on any change to the object.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/react-native/ts/read.test.snippet.crud-read-object-by-id.tsx
         :language: typescript

*Parameters* 

- ``type: string``
A string that matches your object model's class name or a reference to a
class that extends :js-sdk:`Realm.Object <classes/Object.html>`.
- ``primaryKey: T[keyof T]``
The primary key of the desired object.

*Returns*

- ``Realm.Object | null``
A Realm Object or ``null`` if no object is found.

.. _sdks-react-use-query-hook:

useQuery()
``````````

.. code:: typescript
   :copyable: false
   :caption: Type signature

   useQuery<T>(type, query?, deps?): Realm.Results<T & Realm.Object<T>>

The ``useQuery()`` hook returns a :js-sdk:`result <classes/Realm.Results.html>` that is a
collection of realm objects of a given type. These are the results of your query. A query can
be an object class or the class name as a string.

The ``useQuery()`` method subscribes to updates to any objects in the collection
and rerenders the component using it on any change to the results.

You can use ``.filtered()`` and ``.sorted()`` to filter and sort your query
results. You should do this in the ``query`` argument of ``useQuery`` so that
they only run when there are changes in the dependency array. For more examples,
refer to the :ref:`CRUD - Read <react-native-read-objects>` docs.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/react-native/ts/read.test.snippet.crud-read-filter-data.tsx
   :language: typescript
   :emphasize-lines: 3-5, 8-14

*Parameters* 

- ``type: string``
A string that matches your object model's class name or a reference to a
class that extends :js-sdk:`Realm.Object <classes/Object.html>`.
- ``query?: QueryCallback<T>``
A query function that can filter and sort query results. Builds on
``useCallback`` to memoize the query function.
- ``deps?: DependencyList``
A list of query function dependencies that's used to memoize
the query function.

*Returns*

- ``Realm.Results<T>``
A Realm Object or ``null`` if no object is found.

UserProvider Hooks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _sdks-react-use-user-hook:

useUser()
`````````

.. code:: typescript
   :copyable: false
   :caption: Type signature

   useUser<FunctionsFactoryType, CustomDataType, UserProfileDataType>(): Realm.User<FunctionsFactoryType, CustomDataType, UserProfileDataType>

The ``useUser()`` hook provides access to the :js-sdk:`logged-in user <classes/Realm.User.html>`. For example,
you can use ``useUser()`` to log the current user out.

When changes to the user object happen, this hook will rerender its parent
component. For example, if you call ``user.refreshCustomData`` to get updated
custom user data, the ``useUser()`` parent component will rerender.

.. include:: /examples/generated/react-native/v12/RealmWrapper.snippet.log-user-out.tsx.rst

*Returns*

- ``Realm.User``
An instance of the currently-authenticated Realm user.

AppProvider Hooks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _sdks-react-use-app-hook:

useApp()
````````

.. code:: typescript
   :copyable: false
   :caption: Type signature

   useApp<FunctionsFactoryType, CustomDataType>(): Realm.App<FunctionsFactoryType, CustomDataType>

*Example*

The ``useApp()`` hook provides access to a :js-sdk:`Realm.App <classes/App.html>`
instance.

.. include:: /examples/generated/react-native/v12/use-app.snippet.import-use-app.tsx.rst
.. include:: /examples/generated/react-native/v12/use-app.snippet.use-app.tsx.rst

*Returns*

- ``Realm.App``
An instance of the current ``Realm.App`` created by ``AppProvider``.

.. _sdks-react-use-auth-hook:

useAuth()
`````````

.. code:: typescript
   :copyable: false
   :caption: Type signature

You use the `useAuth()` Hook with a result and authentication method.

result
++++++

.. code:: typescript
   :copyable: false
   :caption: Type signature

   result: AuthResult

Result of authentication hook operation. For example, ``result.operation`` gives
you the name of the current operation.

*Enum values* 

- ``state``. Can be "not-started", "pending", "success", "error".
- ``operation``. For a list of all operation names, refer to the
  :realm-react-sdk:`API documentation <enums/AuthOperationName.html>`.

.. _create_context_with_createrealmcontext:

Create Context with createRealmContext()
----------------------------------------

.. code:: typescript
   :copyable: false
   :caption: Type signature

   createRealmContext(realmConfig?): RealmContext

*Parameters* 

- ``realmConfig?: Realm.Configuration``

  All properties of :realm-react-sdk:`BaseConfiguration 
  <types/Realm.BaseConfiguration.html>` can be used.

*Returns*

- ``RealmContext``

  An object containing a ``RealmProvider`` component, and the ``useRealm``,
  ``useQuery`` and ``useObject``  Hooks.

Most of the time, you will only use ``createRealmContext()`` if you need to
configure more than one realm. Otherwise, you should import ``RealmProvider``
and Hooks directly from ``@realm/react``.

The ``createRealmContext()`` method creates a `React Context
<https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context>`__ object for a realm with a given
:realm-react-sdk:`Configuration <types/Realm.BaseConfiguration.html>`. The
``Context`` object contains the following: 

- A Context Provider component that wraps around child components
  and provides them with access to Hooks.
- Various prebuilt Hooks that access the configured realm.

To work with more than one realm, you need to destructure a new realm provider and its
associated hooks from the result of ``createRealmContext()``. You can call this new realm
provider and use its associated Hooks the same way you would with the ``RealmProvider``
imported from the ``@realm/react`` library. You should namespace providers
to avoid confusion about which provider and Hooks you're working with.

Overview
--------

.. admonition:: Version Requirement
   :class: note

   GraphQL requires MongoDB version 4.0 or greater.

The {+service+} :graphql:`GraphQL <>` API allows client applications to access
data stored in a linked MongoDB cluster using any standard GraphQL client.
{+service-short+} automatically creates GraphQL types for every linked
collection that has a defined :doc:`document schema
</mongodb/enforce-a-document-schema>` and evaluates :doc:`role-based permissions
</mongodb/define-roles-and-permissions>` for all GraphQL requests.

.. admonition:: Create an Atlas Cluster for Free
   :class: note

   The GraphQL API lets you access data that you have stored in a
   `MongoDB Atlas
   <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?tck=docs_realm>`__ cluster or
   data lake. To get started, create a free cluster and :doc:`link it to
   your {+app+} </mongodb/link-a-data-source>`.

   If you don't have any data yet but you still want to explore the
   GraphQL API, consider adding a :atlas:`sample data set
   </sample-data>` to your cluster.

To learn how to make data available through the GraphQL API, see
:doc:`Expose Data in a Collection </graphql/expose-data>`.

To learn how to define custom queries and mutations, see :doc:`Define a
Custom Query or Mutation </graphql/custom-resolvers>`.

To learn about the types and operations that you can use with the {+service-short+}
GraphQL API, see :doc:`GraphQL Types & Resolvers
</graphql/types-and-resolvers>`.

Why GraphQL?
------------

GraphQL is a declarative, strongly-typed query language for client
applications. Clients define the exact data shape and contents that they
need in a single request which eliminates over-fetching problems and
circumvents the need for multiple costly round trips to the server.

To learn more about GraphQL, check out the :graphql:`official GraphQL
tutorial <learn>`.

Limitations
-----------

- The GraphQL API can process a maximum of ten resolvers for a given query or
  mutation. If an operation specifies more than ten resolvers, the entire
  operation will fail with the error message ``"max number of queries
  reached"``.

GraphQL Operations
------------------

{+service-short+} automatically generates types and resolvers for data that you
:doc:`expose to the GraphQL API </graphql/expose-data>`. The generated
types and operations are all named after the base type name for each
exposed collection. If you don't define a type name, {+service-short+} uses the
collection name instead.

For more information on how to expose a collection and name its data
type, see :doc:`Expose Data in a Collection </graphql/expose-data>`.

Queries
~~~~~~~

A GraphQL **query** is a read operation that requests specific fields
from one or more types. {+service-short+} automatically generates query types for
documents in each collection that has a defined :doc:`schema
</mongodb/enforce-a-document-schema>`.

For more information and examples, including a list of all automatically
generated query types, see :ref:`Query Resolvers
<graphql-query-resolvers>`.

.. code-block:: text

   # Find a single movie by name
   query {
     movie(query: { title: "The Matrix" }) {
       _id
       title
       year
       runtime
     }
   }

   # Find all movies from the year 2000
   query {
     movies(query: { year: 2000 }) {
       _id
       title
       year
       runtime
     }
   }

   # Find the ten longest movies from the year 2000
   query {
     movies(
       query: { year: 2000 }
       sortBy: RUNTIME_DESC
       limit: 10
     ) {
       _id
       title
       year
       runtime
     }
   }

Mutations
~~~~~~~~~

A GraphQL **mutation** is a write operation that creates, modifies, or
deletes one or more documents. {+service-short+} automatically generates mutation
types for documents in each collection that has a defined :doc:`schema
</mongodb/enforce-a-document-schema>`. {+backend+} uses transactions to ensure
safe writes via mutations.

For more information and examples, including a list of all automatically
generated mutation types, see :ref:`Mutation Resolvers
<graphql-mutation-resolvers>`.

.. code-block:: text

   # Insert a new movie
   mutation {
     insertOneMovie(data: {
       title: "Little Women"
       director: "Greta Gerwig"
       year: 2019
       runtime: 135
     }) {
       _id
       title
     }
   }

   # Update the year of a movie
   mutation {
     updateOneMovie(
       query: { title: "The Matrix" }
       set: { year: 1999 }
     ) {
       _id
       title
     }
   }

   # Delete a movie
   mutation {
     deleteOneMovie(query: { title: "The Room" }) {
       _id
       title
     }
   }

   # Delete multiple movies
   mutation {
     deleteManyMovies(query: { director: "Tommy Wiseau" }) {
       _id
       title
     }
   }

.. _app-services-get-started-overview:

You can get started with Atlas Device SDK and Device Sync in many different
ways. Pick a learning path that matches how you prefer to learn and what 
you want to experience in this sitting.

- Quickly see data syncing across devices in real-time: 
  :ref:`app-services-get-started-template-apps`
- Explore a tutorial that shows you how to modify a template application to 
  adapt it for your use case: :ref:`app-services-get-started-tutorials`
- Check out our example applications to see working implementations for
  common app development scenarios: :ref:`realm-examples`

Once you've gotten an overview of how things work, you may want to dive
deeper with one of these topics:

- Get a comprehensive walkthrough of how all the components fit together:
  :ref:`device-sdk-walkthrough`
- Learn how to configure Device Sync: :ref:`enable-sync`
- Explore permissions implementation details for common use cases: 
  :ref:`flexible-sync-permissions-guide`
- Learn how to model data for Device Sync or the SDK: :ref:`data-model`
- Learn how to perform CRUD operations with the device persistence layer: 
  :ref:`sdk-quick-start`

Quickly See Data Syncing in Real-Time
-------------------------------------

To quickly get started actually seeing data syncing in real-time, create
a Template App. Template apps bring together many of the building blocks 
available in Atlas App Services and Atlas Device SDK and start you off with 
a prebuilt app that you can customize. The following template apps are 
available:

- Todo list mobile apps written with Realm SDKs that sync data with App 
  Services using Device Sync
- A todo list web app using the GraphQL API and the Realm Web SDK

- Learn how to :ref:`create a template app <create-template-app>`
- Take a :ref:`guided exploration <device-sdk-quick-start>` of the template apps
- Check out the template apps in the 
  `Atlas UI <https://www.mongodb.com/realm/register?tck=docs_CTA_realm_template_apps>`__

Overview
--------

You can upload npm modules into your Realm application and use the
uploaded :ref:`external dependencies <external-dependencies>` in your
Functions. This allows your application to depend upon external
libraries for code reuse.

To use external dependencies, upload an archive of an npm
``node_modules`` folder via the Realm UI. Once uploaded, any Realm
Function can import and use any dependencies listed on the dependencies
page of the Realm UI.

Overview
--------

You can upload JavaScript modules from the npm registry into your {+app+}
and use the uploaded :ref:`external dependencies
<external-dependencies>` in your Functions. This allows your application to
depend upon external libraries and reuse code.

To use external dependencies, you must first upload an archive of an npm
``node_modules`` folder. {+service+} automatically transpiles uploaded modules to ES5
and supports most built-in modules. You can :doc:`import an uploaded module
</functions/import-external-dependencies>` in any {+service-short+} Function.

You can see a list of uploaded packages on the :guilabel:`Functions` screen of
the {+ui+} under the :guilabel:`Dependencies` tab.

.. important:: External Dependency Size Constraints

   Uploaded ``node_modules`` archive files are subject to a ``10MB`` size cap.

Summary
-------

- External Dependencies can be uploaded through the {+ui+} 
- Uploaded Dependencies can be used in {+service-short+} Functions

Next Steps
----------

- You have installed and archived your external dependencies locally,
  uploaded them to {+backend+}, and deployed your application. Now you
  can :doc:`import external dependencies
  </functions/import-external-dependencies>` in a {+service-short+} Function.

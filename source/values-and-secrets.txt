Introduction
------------

Realm :ref:`Values <app-value>` and :ref:`Secrets
<app-secret>` are static, server-side variables that you can
access or link to from other components of your application.
You can :doc:`access Values
</values-and-secrets/access-a-value>` directly from
:doc:`Functions </functions>` and :doc:`rule expressions
</services/json-expressions>` and link Secrets to
configuration values for :doc:`authentication providers
</authentication/providers>`.

Concepts
--------

.. _app-value:

Value
~~~~~

A **value** is a named reference to a piece of static data
stored by Realm that you can access in :doc:`Functions
</functions>` and :doc:`rules </services/json-expressions>`.

Values can resolve to two types of data:

- A *plain text* value resolves to a regular JSON object, array, or
  string that you define.

- A *secret* value resolves to the value of a :ref:`Secret <app-secret>`.

.. _app-secret:

Secret
~~~~~~

A **Secret** is a private value that is stored on the Realm
server, hidden from users, and not included in exported
applications. Secrets are useful for storing sensitive
information such as an API key or an internal identifier.

You cannot directly read the value of a Secret after
defining it. Instead, you link to the Secret by name in
authentication provider and service configurations. If you
need to access the Secret from a Function or rule, you can
link the Secret to a :ref:`Value <app-value>`.

.. note::

   You can only define a Secret through the Realm UI or
   :doc:`Admin API </admin/api/admin-v3>`.

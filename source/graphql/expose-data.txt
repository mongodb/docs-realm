Overview
--------

You can expose data from a MongoDB collection to client applications
through the GraphQL API. Realm automatically generates GraphQL types
and resolvers based on the :doc:`collection schema
</mongodb/enforce-a-document-schema>` and enforces :ref:`collection
rules <mongodb-rules>` for all GraphQL operations.

Procedure
---------

1. Configure Roles for the Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Realm enforces :ref:`collection rules <mongodb-rules>` for all incoming
GraphQL requests, so you need to define at least one :doc:`collection
role </mongodb/define-roles-and-permissions>` with the permissions that
your application requires.

All GraphQL requests include an authentication token that identifies the
logged in Realm user that sent the request. Realm evaluates a role for
every document included in a GraphQL operation and only returns fields
and documents that the user has permission to see. If Realm omits a
field, the field has a ``null`` value in the returned document.

2. Define a Schema for Documents in the Collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GraphQL requires that all data conforms to a well-defined type, so you
must :doc:`define a schema </mongodb/enforce-a-document-schema>` for
documents in the collection. Realm automatically generates
:doc:`GraphQL types and resolvers
</graphql/types-and-resolvers>` for documents in the collection
based on the collection schema and regenerates new types whenever the
schema changes.

.. admonition:: Automatically Generate a Schema
   :class: note

   Realm can generate a collection schema for you based on a sample of
   existing documents in the collection. If you don't have existing
   data, you can insert a new document that has a mock implementation of
   the fields you want to include in your schema and then generate a
   schema based on the mock.

3. Define Relationships to Other Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use a collection schema to define relationships that connect
each document in the local collection to one or more documents in a
foreign collection. The foreign collection can be any collection in the
same :doc:`linked MongoDB Atlas data source
</mongodb/link-a-data-source>` as the local collection, including the
local collection itself.

Relationships allow you to fluently reference and query related
documents in GraphQL read and write operations. For example, you can
query for a person and include the full document for each of their
children from the same ``people`` collection:

.. code-block:: text
   
   query {
     person(query: { name: "Molly Weasley" }) {
       _id
       name
       age
       picture
       children {
         _id
         name
         age
         picture
       }
     }
   }

Realm evaluates which foreign documents are related to a given local
document based on a foreign key value. For each relationship, the local
document contains either a single foreign key value or an array of
foreign key values in a specific field. A document is related to any
documents in the foreign collection where the value of the foreign key
field matches a foreign key included in the local field.

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui
      
      To define a relationship in the Realm UI, navigate to the :guilabel:`Rules` page
      for the local collection, click the :guilabel:`Relationships` tab, and enter a
      relationship definition.
      
      Relationship definitions have the following form:
      
      .. code-block:: json
         
         {
           "<Local Field Name>": {
             "ref": "#/realm/<Cluster>/<Database>/<Collection>",
             "foreign_key": "<Foreign Key Field Name>",
             "is_list": <Boolean>
           }
         }
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli
      
      To define a relationship for a local collection using Realm CLI or another
      code deploy method, add a relationship definition to the ``relationships``
      field of the collection's rules configuration file.
      
      .. code-block:: json
         :caption: ``/services/mongodb-atlas/rules/<db>.<collection>.json``
         
         {
           ...,
           relationships: {
             "<Local Field Name>": {
               "ref": "#/realm/<Cluster>/<Database>/<Collection>",
               "foreign_key": "<Foreign Key Field Name>",
               "is_list": <Boolean>
             }
           }
         }

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 60
   
   * - Field Name
     - Type
     - Description
   
   * - ``<Local Field Name>``
     - String
     - The name of a field defined in the local collection
   
   * - ``ref``
     - String
     - A path that specifies the foreign collection that contains the
       related documents.
   
   * - ``foreign_key``
     - String
     - The field name that contains the reference value for each
       document in the foreign collection. A document in the foreign
       collection is related if its ``foreign_key`` value matches the
       local field value.
   
   * - ``is_list``
     - Boolean
     
     - Indicates whether the relationship is to a single document or
       multiple documents. If ``true``, the local field contains an
       array of values. Otherwise, the field contains a single value.
       
       A relationship is not valid if ``is_list`` is ``true`` but your
       schema does not define the field as an array (or vice-versa).

.. example::
   
   Consider an application that has two collections:
   
   - The ``accounts`` collection contains documents that each describe
     a customer account.
     
     .. code-block:: json
        :caption: Account Collection Schema
        :emphasize-lines: 5
        
        {
          "title": "Account",
          "properties": {
            "_id": { "bsonType": "objectId" },
            "account_id": { "bsonType": "string" },
            "products": {
              "bsonType": "array",
              "items": { "bsonType": "string" }
            },
            ...
          }
        }
   
   - The ``customers`` collection contains documents that each describe
     a single customer that can have one or more accounts. Every
     document in the ``customers`` collection has an ``accounts`` field
     that contains an array of every ``account_id`` value from the
     ``accounts`` collection that applies to the customer.
     
     .. code-block:: json
        :caption: Customer Collection Schema
        :emphasize-lines: 5-8
        
        {
          "title": "Customer",
          "properties": {
            "username": { "bsonType": "string" },
            "accounts": {
              "bsonType": "array",
              "items": { "bsonType": "string" }
            },
            ...
          }
        }
   
   The app defines this relationship on the ``customers`` collection. It
   points from the array of account id values stored in the ``accounts``
   field to the ``account_id`` field of each document in the
   ``accounts`` collection.
   
   .. code-block:: json
      
      {
        "accounts": {
          "ref": "#/realm/mongodb-atlas/sample_analytics/accounts",
          "foreign_key": "account_id",
          "is_list": true
        }
      }
   
   With this relationship defined, Realm can fluidly return a customer
   and all of their accounts in the same GraphQL query.
   
   .. code-block:: text
      
      query CustomerAccounts {
        customer(query: { username: "Elizabeth Ray" }) {
          username
          accounts {
            account_id
            products
          }
        }
      }

4. Name the Data Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Realm names the GraphQL types that it generates based on the data type
that documents in the collection conform to. You can configure the name
of the GraphQL types by setting the ``title`` field in a schema to the
name of the data type that the schema defines.

There are three situations where you can set the ``title`` field:

- You can define the type name for each document in a collection by
  setting ``title`` at the root level of the schema. If you don't
  specify a title, Realm uses the name of the collection instead.

- You can define the type name for an embedded object by setting
  ``title`` in the embedded object schema.

- You can define the type name for a field that has a defined
  relationship by setting ``title`` in the field schema. Realm uses the
  ``title`` instead of the defined field name when it resolves
  relationships in GraphQL.

.. code-block:: json
   :emphasize-lines: 2

   {
     "title": "movie",
     "properties": {
       "_id": { "bsonType": "objectId" },
       "title": { "bsonType": "string" },
       "year": { "bsonType": "int" },
       "director": { "bsonType": "int" }
     }
   }

.. admonition:: Singular and Plural Types
   :class: note

   {+service-short+} generates two :ref:`GraphQL queries
   <graphql-query-resolvers>` for each collection:
   
   - A **singular** query that finds a specific document in the collection. The
     query uses the same name as the schema's ``title``. If the schema's
     ``title`` is a plural noun, {+service-short+} attempts to use its singular
     form as determined by the `Rails ActiveSupport inflection rules
     <https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activesupport/lib/active_support/inflections.rb>`__.
   
   - A **plural** query that finds a subset of all documents in the collection.
     If possible, the query uses the plural form of the singular query name. If
     {+service-short+} is unable to pluralize the name or if the pluralized name
     is the same as the singular name, the plural query uses the same name as
     the singular query with an additional ``"s"`` appended to the end.

   .. example::
      
      The following schema is configured for the ``laboratory.mice``
      collection:
      
      .. code-block:: json
         
         {
           "title": "Mouse",
           "bsonType": "object",
           "properties": {
             "_id": { "bsonType": "objectId" },
             "name": { "bsonType": "string" },
             "age": { "bsonType": "int" }
           }
         }
      
      {+service-short+} generates two queries, ``mouse`` (singular) and ``mice``
      (plural), based on the schema:

      .. code-block:: text
         
         query Mice {
           mouse(query: { _id: "5ebe6819197003ddb1f74475" }) {
             name
             age
           }
           mice {
             name
             age
           }
         }

Next Steps
----------

Once you have defined a schema for the collection, Realm automatically exposes
the documents in the collection through the GraphQL API. You can now connect
from a client application and execute queries and mutations.

Overview
--------

{+service+} applications are billed according to how much they're used on a
monthly basis. There are four independently-measured usage types that determine
how much you pay each month:

- :ref:`Realm Requests <billing-requests>`, which measures the number of
  requests that MongoDB Realm sends and receives from client applications and
  external services. Requests include function calls, trigger executions, and
  sync updates, but exclude user authentication.

- :ref:`Realm Compute <billing-compute>`, which measures the runtime and memory
  usage of all requests excluding sync and authentication.

- :ref:`Realm Sync <billing-sync>`, which measures the total amount of time in
  which a client application is actively syncing.

- :ref:`Data Transfer <billing-data-transfer>`, which measures the amount of
  data that {+service+} sends to external services and client applications.

.. admonition:: Track Your Usage
   :class: note
   
   You can track an application's usage for the current month from the
   application dashboard in the {+ui+}.

Monthly Free Tier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All {+service+} apps in a MongoDB Atlas project share a single monthly free
tier. All usage below the free tier thresholds in a given month is not billed.
Once the sum of all application usage in an organization exceeds a free tier
usage threshold, {+service-short+} immediately begins to bill for any additional
usage.

{+service+} is free to use below the following monthly free tier thresholds:

- 1,000,000 :ref:`requests <billing-requests>` **or** 500 hours of
  :ref:`compute <billing-compute>` **or** 10,000 hours of :ref:`sync
  <billing-sync>` runtime (whichever occurs first)

- 10GB of :ref:`data transfer <billing-data-transfer>`

Invoicing and Payment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+service+} is billed as part of MongoDB Atlas. All payment methods that
work with Atlas can be used to pay for {+service-short+}, including
prepaid Atlas Credits. Any costs associated with a linked Atlas data
source, such as database operations and backup, are billed separately
from {+service-short+}.

See :ref:`MongoDB Atlas Billing <atlas-billing>` for more information.

Usage Types
-----------

.. _billing-requests:

Realm Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+service-short+} counts the number of requests that an application receives and
handles. Authentication provider requests do not count towards your monthly
usage.

Requests are billed at a set rate for each request. There are three primary
types of request:

- **Function Executions**, such as when a user calls a function from a client
  app or when a function calls an external service. If an executing function
  calls another function, {+service-short+} considers both executions as part of
  the same request.

- **Trigger Executions**, such as when a database trigger matches a change
  event, a scheduled trigger is configured to fire, or an authentication
  triggers responds to a user login.

- **GraphQL Requests**, such as when a client application issues a
  GraphQL query operation or calls a custom resolver.

- **Webhook Requests**, such as when an external service sends a notification
  event or interaction payload to an incoming webhook URL.

- **Sync Operations**, such as when a client application modifies a synced
  {+realm+} or when {+service-short+} sends a sync changeset to a connected sync
  client. Each sync changeset that {+service-short+} sends to or receives from a
  given client is considered a separate request. Sync conflict resolutions are
  considered a separate request from the write operations that caused the
  conflict.

**Price:** $2.00 / 1,000,000 requests ($0.000002 / request)

**Formula:** (Function Executions + Trigger Executions + GraphQL/Webhook Requests + Sync Updates) * $0.000002

**Free Tier Threshold:** 1,000,000 :ref:`requests <billing-requests>` **or** 500
hours of :ref:`compute <billing-compute>` **or** 10,000 hours of :ref:`sync
<billing-sync>` runtime (whichever occurs first)

.. admonition:: Estimate Your Usage
   :class: admonition-example
   
   Consider answering the following questions to help estimate the number of
   requests that your application will receive each month.
   
   **Triggers**
   
   - How many times does this trigger execute each month?
   
   **Functions/GraphQL**
   
   - How many requests do you receive each user session?
   - How many monthly active users does your app have?
   - How many sessions does an average user open each month?
   
   **Realm Sync Requests**
   
   - How many write operations do users issue each session?
   - How many updates do users receive each session?
   - How many devices or active users does your app have?

.. _billing-compute:

Realm Compute
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+service-short+} counts the total amount of time and memory that each non-sync
application request takes to process. Compute is billed at a set rate for each
millisecond of runtime. For large requests, this rate is multiplied by a factor
that reflects the amount of memory the request used.

The memory multiplier begins at 1 (i.e. it does not affect your billing rate)
and increases by 1 for every 32MB of memory that a given request uses.

**Price:** $10.00 / 500 runtime hours (~$0.000000005 / ms)

**Formula:** (# Requests) * (Runtime (ms)) * (Memory (MB) / 32MB) * $0.000000005 / ms

**Free Tier Threshold:** 1,000,000 :ref:`requests <billing-requests>` **or** 500
hours of :ref:`compute <billing-compute>` **or** 10,000 hours of :ref:`sync
<billing-sync>` runtime (whichever occurs first)

.. admonition:: Estimate Your Usage
   :class: admonition-example
   
   Consider answering the following questions to help estimate the amount of
   compute time that your application will use each month.
   
   **Runtime**

   - How many sessions does a user open each month?
   - How many requests do you receive each session?
   - How long does each request take?
   - What does each request do?
   - How many requests do you make to MongoDB Atlas or another service?
   - Does a request handle heavy data processing? 
   
   **Memory Usage**
   
   - How much in-memory data does your application process for each request?
   - How many MongoDB documents does a request affect?

.. _billing-sync:

Realm Sync
~~~~~~~~~~

{+service-short+} counts the total amount of time in which a client application
user has an active connection to the sync server even if they are not 
transferring data at the time. Sync is billed at a set rate for each 
millisecond of sync runtime per user.

**Price:** $0.08 / 1,000,000 runtime minutes ($0.00000008 / ms)

**Formula:** (# Active Users) * (Sync time (ms / user)) * ($0.00000008 / ms)

**Free Tier Threshold:** 1,000,000 :ref:`requests <billing-requests>` **or** 500
hours of :ref:`compute <billing-compute>` **or** 10,000 hours of :ref:`sync
<billing-sync>` runtime (whichever occurs first)

.. admonition:: Estimate Your Usage
   :class: admonition-example
   
   Consider answering the following questions to help estimate the amount of
   sync time that your application will use each month.

   **Sync Sessions**
   
   - How many monthly active users does your app have?
   - How much time is an average user online each month?

.. _billing-data-transfer:

Data Transfer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+service-short+} measures the total amount of data that your application sends
out to client applications and external services. Data transfer is billed at a
set rate for each gigabyte of data egress.

**Price:** $0.12 per GB

**Formula:** (Data sent to clients/services (GB)) * ($0.12 / GB)

**Free Tier Threshold:** 10GB

.. admonition:: MongoDB Atlas Data Transfer
   :class: note
   
   {+service+} does not bill for data transfer to and from a linked
   MongoDB Atlas data source.

.. admonition:: Estimate Your Usage
   :class: admonition-example
   
   Consider answering the following questions to help estimate the amount of
   data that your application will transfer each month.
   
   **Data Transfer**
   
   - How many updates/requests does an average user issues each month? 
   - How much data is sent to users per update/request?
   - How often is data sent to external services?
   - How much data might be sent in each external service call?

Examples
--------

Mobile Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A group messaging application uses MongoDB Realm to manage permissions and sync
messages between users in the same group. The app has the following usage:

- There are around 2,000 active group chats in any given month.

- The average group chat has 4 users that each send around 900 messages each
  month.

- Messages are usually small but may contain up to 2KB of data.

- The average user has the app open for about 9 hours each month.

The following calculations approximate the cost of running this application for
one month:

.. cssclass:: config-table
.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 85
   
   * - Usage Type
     - Calculation
   
   * - :ref:`Realm Requests <billing-requests>`
     - - (2000 chats) * (4 users / chat) * (900 messages / user) = 7,200,000 messages
       
       - (7,200,000 messages) * ((1 write + 3 reads) / message) = 28,800,000 requests
       
       - (28,800,000 requests) - (1,000,000 free tier requests) = 27,800,000 requests

       - (27,800,000 requests) * ($0.000002 / request) = **$55.60**
   
   * - :ref:`Realm Sync <billing-sync>`
     - - (2000 chats) * (4 users / chat) * (9 hrs / user) = 72,000 active hrs
       
       - (72,000 active hrs) - (2,500 free tier hours) = 69,500 active hrs

       - (69,500 active hrs) * (60 mins / hr) * ($0.00000008 / min) = **$0.33**
   
   * - :ref:`Data Transfer <billing-data-transfer>`
     - - (7,200,000 messages) * (3 reads / message) = 21,600,000 reads
       
       - (21,600,000 reads) * (0.000002 GB / read) = 43.2 GB
       
       - (43.2 GB) - (10 free tier GB) = 33.2 GB

       - (33.2 GB) * ($0.12 / GB) = **$3.98**

   * - **TOTAL**
     - $55.60 (requests) + $0.33 (sync) + $3.98 (data transfer) = **$59.91 / month**

.. admonition:: Free Tier Usage
   :class: note
   
   The way that free tier usage affects your bill depends on your consumption
   each month. For this example, we assume that all requests and activity are
   spread evenly throughout the month.
   
   On every day of a 30 day month this application would handle 960,000
   requests, 2,400 sync hours, and 1.44 GB of data transfer. The app would hit
   the requests/compute/sync threshold on the second day of the month and the
   data transfer threshold on the seventh day.
   
   The free tier would cover the following usage in each area:
   
   - **Realm Requests:** 1,000,000 requests
   - **Realm Sync:** 2,500 hours
   - **Data Transfer:** 10 GB

Web Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A hardware store uses a web application that allows customers to browse and
order items online. The app uses Realm Functions and the GraphQL API to fetch
items based on a user's search, get detailed information for specific items, and
submit orders. The app has the following usage:

- There are around 100,000 visitors each month

- An average visitor performs 2 searches, looks at 10 items, and submits an
  order 20% of the time.

- Search results, item data, and order requests contain 4KB or less

The following calculations approximate the cost of running this application for
one month:

.. cssclass:: config-table
.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 85
   
   * - Usage Type
     - Calculation

   * - :ref:`Realm Requests <billing-requests>`
     - - (2 searches + 10 items + 0.20 orders) / visitor = 12.2 requests / visitor
       
       - (12.2 requests / visitor) * (100,000 visitors) = 1,220,000 requests

       - (1,220,000 requests) - (1,000,000 free tier requests) = (220,000 requests)
       
       - (220,000 requests) * ($0.000002 / request) = **$0.44**

   * - :ref:`Realm Compute <billing-compute>`
     - - (100,000 visitors) * ((2 searches + 10 items + 0.20 orders) / visitor) = 1,220,000 requests
       
       - (1,220,000 requests) * (100 ms / request) * 1 = 122,000,000 ms
         
         - *100 ms is a conservative runtime estimate for lightweight functions*
         - *4KB is well under 32MB, so the memory multiplier is 1*
       
       - (122,000,000 ms) - (28,152,000 free tier ms) = 93,848,000 ms
       
       - (93,848,000 ms) * ($0.000000005 / ms) = **$0.47**

   * - :ref:`Data Transfer <billing-data-transfer>`
     - - (1,220,000 requests) * (0.000002 GB / request) = 4.88 GB
       
       - (4.88 GB) - (10 free tier GB) = 0GB
       
       - (0GB) * ($0.12 / GB) = **FREE**

   * - **TOTAL**
     - $0.44 (requests) + $0.47 (compute) + $0 (data transfer) = **$0.91 / month**

.. admonition:: Free Tier Usage
   :class: note

   The way that free tier usage affects your bill depends on your consumption
   each month. For this example, we assume that all requests and activity are
   spread evenly throughout the month.
   
   On every day of a 30 day month this application would handle 41,290 requests,
   1.3 compute hours, and 16.8 GB of data transfer. The app would hit the
   requests/compute threshold on the 24th day of the month and the data transfer
   threshold on the first day.
   
   The free tier would cover the following usage in each area:
   
   - **Realm Requests:** 1,000,000 requests
   - **Realm Compute:** 7.82 hours
   - **Data Transfer:** 10 GB

Backend Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A regional pizza chain uses MongoDB Realm to handle orders for all of its
restaurants. The app has the following usage:

- The chain has 25 stores and each store gets about 12,000 orders each month

- For each order, a database trigger sends the customer an email receipt.
  Another trigger sends text message updates to the customer when their order is
  received, when it's sent out for delivery, and when it's about to be
  delivered.

- A scheduled trigger runs every 5 minutes to monitor delivery times. If a
  delivery is taking too long, it sends a text message update to the user. About
  10% of all deliveries take too long.

- Orders vary in size but are no larger than 4KB

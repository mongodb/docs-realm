Welcome to the {+service+} documentation! You can use the guides and reference
materials here to learn how to work with the two key components of Realm: the
Realm SDKs and MongoDB Realm application services.

- The Realm SDKs are a set of free and open source client libraries that you can
  use to build mobile, desktop, or IoT applications. The SDKs each include Realm
  Database, an embedded object database that stores data directly on the device
  and uses an idomatic object model instead of a tabular data model. You can
  also use the SDKs to connect to MongoDB Realm and sync data between client
  applications and MongoDB Atlas.

- MongoDB Realm is a cloud application platform run and hosted by MongoDB that
  provides services for your app. You can write serverless functions to handle
  your application logic and data access rules to manage user-level read and
  write permissions, all without worrying about the creating and maintaining the
  underlying infrastructure. Other services include Realm Sync, user
  authentication and authorization, database triggers, static file hosting, and
  more.

Realm includes an embedded, object-oriented database that lets you build
real-time, offline-first applications. You can also use Realm’s hosted
application services as a secure backend that can sync data between devices,
authenticate and manage users, and run serverless JavaScript functions.

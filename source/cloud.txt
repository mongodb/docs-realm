{+service+} enables real-time data sync between the :doc:`Realm SDKs
</sdk>` and :atlas:`MongoDB Atlas <>`. {+service-short+} also includes a
suite of tools for building cross-platform applications like user
authentication providers, serverless functions & triggers, and dynamic
data access rules.

MongoDB Realm is a hosted cloud platform that provides services to run your
application logic and securely access and sync data. Realm helps developers
focus on building great user experiences by providing production-ready services
that eliminate the need to write repetitive boilerplate code. MongoDB Realm can
be used in conjunction with the Realm SDKs to build full stack application or on
its own for fully serverless applications.

For instance, the platform can run database triggers off any data changes in
MongoDB Atlas. A web developer could add webhooks and host their site on MongoDB
Realm all without needing to stand-up and maintain servers. A mobile developer
could leverage Sync on MongoDB Realm to eliminate all of the networking code
they would normally need to write. All developers can take advantage of MongoDB
Realmâ€™s authentication and authorization system to guard their data stored in
MongoDB Atlas.

title: Create a Realm App Client
ref: create-a-realm-app-client
level: 4

  The app client is the primary interface to your Realm app from the SDK. In
  ``src/App.js``, replace ``"TODO"`` with your Realm App ID:

  .. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/code/final/App.codeblock.appID.js
     :caption: ``src/App.js``
     :language: javascript

  .. admonition:: Use Your App ID
     :class: note
     
     Make sure to replace ``"TODO"`` with your app's unique
     :guilabel:`App ID`. You can find your :guilabel:`App ID` by clicking the
     copy button next to the name of your app in the lefthand navigation of the
     Realm UI.

title: Complete the Registration & Authentication Functions
ref: complete-the-registration-authentication-functions
level: 4
content: |
  The app client provides methods that allow you to authenticate and register
  users through the email/password authentication provider. In
  ``src/RealmApp.js``, the ``RealmAppProvider`` component wraps these functions
  and keeps the app client in sync with local React state.

  These wrapping functions already have the state update calls but don't
  currently use the app client you created. You need to update the functions to
  actually call the SDK authentication and registration methods.

.. note::

   While Flexible Sync is in *preview*, you cannot use Flexible Sync &
   Partition-Based Sync in the same {+app+}. You must decide which {+sync+} mode
   to use in a given application. To switch between Sync modes, you must
   :ref:`terminate & re-enable Sync <terminating-and-reenabling-sync>`, which
   triggers a :ref:`client reset <client-resets>`.

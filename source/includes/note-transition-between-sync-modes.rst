.. note::

   While Flexible Sync is in *preview*, you cannot use Flexible Sync &
   Partition-Based Sync in the same {+app+}. You must decide which {+sync+}
   mode to use in a given application. To switch between sync modes, you must
   :ref:`terminate & re-enable sync <terminating-and-reenabling-sync>`.

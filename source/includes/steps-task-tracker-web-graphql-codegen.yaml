  - Navigate to the :guilabel:`GraphQL` page in the Realm UI
  - Click the :guilabel:`Schema` tab
  - Click the :guilabel:`GraphQL Schema` button to download the schema
  - Copy the downloaded schema into ``src/realm/``, overwriting the
    ``schema.graphql`` that's already there.
  - Alternatively, copy the schema from the UI and paste it directly into
    ``schema.graphql``

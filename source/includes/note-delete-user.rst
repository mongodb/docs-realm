.. note::

   Realm does not automatically delete any data in your :term:`linked {+atlas+}
   cluster <linked cluster>` that you have associated with a deleted user, such
   as by including their ID in an ``owner_id`` field. To remove all traces of a
   deleted user, you must manually delete or modify any such documents.

- This tutorial starts with a Template App. You need an `Atlas Account 
  <https://cloud.mongodb.com/user/register?tck=docs_realm>`_ to create a 
  Template App. For this tutorial, you need an Atlas account with a free-tier 
  cluster.
- If you want to use the {+cli+} to create the template app, you also need:

  - An Atlas :atlas:`API key
    </configure-api-access/#programmatic-api-keys>` for the MongoDB
    Cloud account you wish to log in with. You must be a :atlas:`Project
    Owner </reference/user-roles/#project-roles>` to create a Template
    App using {+cli-bin+}.

  - To learn more about installing {+cli-bin+}, see :ref:`Install App
    Services CLI <install-appservices-cli>`. After installing, run the
    :ref:`login <appservices-login>` command using the API key for
    your Atlas project.

  If you use the UI to create a template app, you can disregard these 
  requirements.

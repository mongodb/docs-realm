  Open Xcode and create a new iOS Project. Use the "Single View App" template.
  Enter your project details, select "Storyboard" for user interface, deselect
  "Include Unit Tests", and save.

title: Confirm That Your App Runs
ref: confirm-that-your-app-runs
content: |
  Before adding new code, it's a good idea to make sure the
  project is set up correctly and you can compile and run
  the app. Test your app by selecting a simulator from the
  build menu and pressing the Run button. Xcode should build
  and launch your app successfully and present you with a
  simulator with the empty app.

title: Install the Realm Frameworks with CocoaPods
ref: install-realm-frameworks
content: |
  :ref:`Install the Realm frameworks <ios-install>` with an iOS dependency
  manager. This tutorial uses `CocoaPods
  <https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html>`__.

  Cocoapods uses a ``Podfile`` to track, load, and manage your project's
  external dependencies. To create the ``Podfile``, quit Xcode and open your
  Xcode project directory in a new terminal window. Run the following command:

  .. code-block:: sh

     pod init

  This creates an initial ``Podfile``. To specify your dependencies, edit the
  ``Podfile`` in your editor of choice and make the following changes:

  - Set the iOS version to 13.0.
  - Add the line ``use_frameworks!`` if it is not already there.
  - Add the line ``pod 'RealmSwift', '=10.0.0-beta.3'`` to your main target.

  When done, your Podfile should look something like this:

  .. code-block:: text
     :emphasize-lines: 1, 5, 8

        platform :ios, '13.0'

        target 'TaskTracker' do
          # Comment the next line if you don't want to use dynamic frameworks
          use_frameworks!

          # Pods for TaskTracker
          pod 'RealmSwift', '=10.0.0-beta.3'

        end

  Save your changes, then run the following command from the terminal window to
  download the required packages and create an Xcode workspace that is
  configured:

  .. code-block:: text

     pod install --repo-update

  Open the Xcode workspace file that CocoaPods just created to continue working
  on your project. For example, you can run ``open TaskTracker.xcworkspace``
  from the command line.

title: Remove Unnecessary UI Files
ref: remove-unnecessary-files
content: |
  We'll build the app's UI programmatically, so we don't need some of the files
  that come with the standard single page app template.

  .. note:
     A tutorial using SwiftUI is coming soon.

  1. Open the ``Info.plist`` for your target in the ``TaskTracker`` group in the file navigator.
  2. Find the ``Main storyboard file base name`` entry and remove it by pressing the ``-`` icon next to it in the property editor.
  3. Find the ``Application Scene Manifest`` entry and expand it to reveal ``Scene Configuration > Application Session Role > Item 0 (Default Configuration)``. Remove the ``Storyboard Name`` entry by pressing the ``-`` icon next to it in the property editor.
  4. In the file navigator, find the ``Main.storyboard`` and ``LaunchScreen.storyboard`` files. Delete them by selecting each one and pressing the delete key on your keyboard.

title: Open Your Realm App and Specify the Starting Screen in the SceneDelegate Class
ref: specify-the-starting-screen
content: |

  In order to use {+backend+} functionality such as user
  authentication and sync, we need to access the {+app+}
  from our client code.

  Let's declare the {+app+} instance as a global variable in
  the scene entrypoint file, SceneDelegate.swift. 

  In a production app, you might decide to move the
  initialization of the {+app+} instance elsewhere in your
  code or defer initialization until you have read some
  configuration from a file. For now, a global variable is
  fine. We will hardcode everything the iOS app needs to
  know about our {+backend+} app in a structure called
  ``Constants``.

  .. include:: /includes/note-find-app-id.rst

  Open SceneDelegate.swift in Xcode and add the following code near the top of
  the file:

  .. code-block:: swift

     import RealmSwift
     
     struct Constants {
         // Set this to your Realm App ID found in the Realm UI.
         static let REALM_APP_ID = "<your-realm-app-id>"
     }
     let app = App(id: Constants.REALM_APP_ID)

  Replace ``<your-realm-app-id>`` with your {+app+} ID, which you can find in
  the {+ui+}.

  .. note::

     Xcode may show errors next to the new import line or other lines. This is
     normal. These will disappear as we add more code and compile the app.

  We also use the SceneDelegate to navigate to our custom login page that we
  will define soon. Within the SceneDelegate class, declare a ``UIWindow?``
  property and replace the ``func scene(_ scene: UIScene, willConnectTo session:
  UISceneSession, options connectionOptions: UIScene.ConnectionOptions)``
  method:

  .. code-block:: swift

     var window: UIWindow?

     func scene(_ scene: UIScene, willConnectTo session: UISceneSession, options connectionOptions: UIScene.ConnectionOptions) {
         // Use this method to optionally configure and attach the UIWindow `window` to the provided UIWindowScene `scene`.
         // If using a storyboard, the `window` property will automatically be initialized and attached to the scene.
         // This delegate does not imply the connecting scene or session are new (see `application:configurationForConnectingSceneSession` instead).

         guard let windowScene = (scene as? UIWindowScene) else { return }
                
         window = UIWindow(windowScene: windowScene)
         window?.makeKeyAndVisible()
         window?.rootViewController = UINavigationController(rootViewController: WelcomeViewController())
     }

  This sets up the ``UINavigationController`` with a
  ``WelcomeViewController`` that we will define next.
---
title: Implement User Authentication on the Welcome page
ref: implement-user-authentication
content: |
  When a user starts the app, we want to present them with a
  form into which they can enter their email address and
  password. If they do not have an account, the user can
  press a "sign up" button to register an account. If the
  account already exists, the user can press a "sign in"
  button to sign in with that account. We will add a loading
  indicator so that the user knows when the app is
  processing their requests and a text area where we can
  present any error messages to the user.

  .. figure:: /images/swift-tutorial-welcome-view.png
     :alt: The finished welcome view controller
     :width: 300px
     :lightbox:

  To create the view controller, select ``File > New >
  File...`` in Xcode. Select "Cocoa Touch Class" from the
  file type selector panel. Press next then enter
  "WelcomeViewController" for the class name and
  set the subclass name to UIViewController. Press next again,
  navigate to your Xcode project directory in the file browser, and
  save the file.

  With the WelcomeViewController file open, the first thing
  to add at the top of the file is the import statement for
  RealmSwift, so that our view controller can use
  {+service-short+}:

  .. code-block:: swift

     import RealmSwift

  To build out the UI programmatically, we need to declare
  some members to hold our UI elements. Add these members in
  the new class right after the opening brace of the class
  definition:

  .. code-block:: swift

     class WelcomeViewController: UIViewController {
         let usernameField = UITextField()
         let passwordField = UITextField()
         let signInButton = UIButton(type: .roundedRect)
         let signUpButton = UIButton(type: .roundedRect)
         let errorLabel = UILabel()
         let activityIndicator = UIActivityIndicatorView(style: .medium)

         var username: String? {
             get {
                 return usernameField.text
             }
         }

         var password: String? {
             get {
                 return passwordField.text
             }
         }
         // ...

  Next, add a ``viewDidLoad`` method to the view controller.
  This is where we will set up the login UI
  programmatically. This just arranges and configures the
  inputs for username and password, sign in and sign up
  buttons, an area for a status or error message and a
  loading indicator.

  .. note::

     Excited for SwiftUI? So are we! A tutorial using
     {+service-short+} with SwiftUI is coming soon.

  .. code-block:: swift

     override func viewDidLoad() {
         super.viewDidLoad();
         view.backgroundColor = .white

         // Create a view that will automatically lay out the other controls.
         let container = UIStackView();
         container.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
         container.axis = .vertical
         container.alignment = .fill
         container.spacing = 16.0;
         view.addSubview(container)

         // Configure the activity indicator.
         activityIndicator.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
         view.addSubview(activityIndicator)

         // Set the layout constraints of the container view and the activity indicator.
         let guide = view.safeAreaLayoutGuide
         NSLayoutConstraint.activate([
             // This pins the container view to the top and stretches it to fill the parent
             // view horizontally.
             container.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: guide.leadingAnchor, constant: 16),
             container.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: guide.trailingAnchor, constant: -16),
             container.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: guide.topAnchor, constant: 16),
             // The activity indicator is centered over the rest of the view.
             activityIndicator.centerYAnchor.constraint(equalTo: guide.centerYAnchor),
             activityIndicator.centerXAnchor.constraint(equalTo: guide.centerXAnchor),
             ])

         // Add some text at the top of the view to explain what to do.
         let infoLabel = UILabel()
         infoLabel.numberOfLines = 0
         infoLabel.text = "Please enter a username and password."
         container.addArrangedSubview(infoLabel)

         // Configure the username and password text input fields.
         usernameField.placeholder = "Username"
         usernameField.borderStyle = .roundedRect
         usernameField.autocapitalizationType = .none
         usernameField.autocorrectionType = .no
         container.addArrangedSubview(usernameField)

         passwordField.placeholder = "Password"
         passwordField.isSecureTextEntry = true
         passwordField.borderStyle = .roundedRect
         container.addArrangedSubview(passwordField)

         // Configure the sign in and sign up buttons.
         signInButton.setTitle("Sign In", for: .normal);
         signInButton.addTarget(self, action: #selector(signIn), for: .touchUpInside)
         container.addArrangedSubview(signInButton)

         signUpButton.setTitle("Sign Up", for: .normal);
         signUpButton.addTarget(self, action: #selector(signUp), for: .touchUpInside)
         container.addArrangedSubview(signUpButton)

         // Error messages will be set on the errorLabel.
         errorLabel.numberOfLines = 0
         errorLabel.textColor = .red
         container.addArrangedSubview(errorLabel)
     }    

  Since we added a loading indicator, let's make it easy to
  use. Add the following method that controls the app UI
  state, ensuring the app UI is always in one of two states:

  - All inputs **disabled** and activity indicator **shown**, or
  - All inputs **enabled** and activity indicator **hidden**.

  .. code-block:: swift

     // Turn on or off the activity indicator.
     func setLoading(_ loading: Bool) {
         if loading {
             activityIndicator.startAnimating();
             errorLabel.text = "";
         } else {
             activityIndicator.stopAnimating();
         }
         usernameField.isEnabled = !loading
         passwordField.isEnabled = !loading
         signInButton.isEnabled = !loading
         signUpButton.isEnabled = !loading
     }

  Finally, we need to implement the actual business logic of
  signing in to {+backend-short+}. When we set up the UI, we
  wired the "sign up" button to a ``signUp`` method and the
  "sign in" button to the ``signIn`` method, but we haven't
  defined those methods yet. Let's define them now, starting
  with ``signUp``:

  .. code-block:: swift

     @objc func signUp() {
         setLoading(true);
         app.emailPasswordAuth().registerEmail(username!, password: password!, completion: {[weak self](error) in
             // Completion handlers are not necessarily called on the UI thread.
             // This call to DispatchQueue.main.sync ensures that any changes to the UI,
             // namely disabling the loading indicator and navigating to the next page,
             // are handled on the UI thread:
             DispatchQueue.main.sync {
                 self!.setLoading(false);
                 guard error == nil else {
                     print("Signup failed: \(error!)")
                     self!.errorLabel.text = "Signup failed: \(error!.localizedDescription)"
                     return
                 }
                 print("Signup successful!")
                 
                 // Registering just registers. Now we need to sign in,
                 // but we can reuse the existing username and password. 
                 self!.errorLabel.text = "Signup successful! Signing in..."
                 self!.signIn()
             }
         })
     }

  First, we use our loading indicator method to disable the
  form and show the loading indicator, so that the user gets
  feedback that we are in fact processing their request.

  Next, we access the ``emailPasswordAuth`` of the App we opened in the
  AppDelegate. Each authentication provider has a provider client that gives us
  access to the functionality of that specific provider. In this case, we want
  to register the user's email with the ``registerEmail()`` method. We pass the
  username and password field values from our UI into this method as well as a
  completion handler that {+service-short+} calls when the action completes. 

  The completion handler is not guaranteed to run on the
  main thread. In fact, it is likely to run on a background
  thread. Since we want to update the UI here, and iOS
  strictly forbids you from updating the UI on anything but
  the main thread, we must be sure we are in fact running
  our code on the main thread. That's why, in the completion
  handler, the first thing we do is dispatch back to the
  main thread.

  Now that we're on the main thread, it's equally important
  to turn the activity indicator back off before anything
  else, so that our app's UI is never in a bad state.

  Next, we handle errors. For now, let's just print them to
  the console and present them on our error label in the UI.

  We set up our {+app+} to automatically verify email/password accounts, so the
  user doesn't need to do anything before they can use their account. So, we can
  go ahead and sign in with the ``signIn()`` method we will write now:

  .. code-block:: swift

     @objc func signIn() {
         print("Log in as user: \(username!)");
         setLoading(true);
         
         app.login(credentials: Credentials(username: username!, password: password!)) { [weak self](user, error) in
             // Completion handlers are not necessarily called on the UI thread.
             // This call to DispatchQueue.main.sync ensures that any changes to the UI,
             // namely disabling the loading indicator and navigating to the next page,
             // are handled on the UI thread:
             DispatchQueue.main.sync {
                 self!.setLoading(false);
                 guard error == nil else {
                     // Auth error: user already exists? Try logging in as that user.
                     print("Login failed: \(error!)");
                     self!.errorLabel.text = "Login failed: \(error!.localizedDescription)"
                     return
                 }

                 print("Login succeeded!");

                 // For the first phase of the tutorial, go directly to the Tasks page
                 // for the hardcoded project ID "My Project".
                 // This will use a common project and demonstrate sync.
                 let partitionValue = "My Project"

                 // Open a realm.
                 let projectRealm = try! Realm(configuration: user.configuration(partitionValue: partitionValue))

                 self!.navigationController!.pushViewController(TasksViewController(projectRealm: projectRealm), animated: true);
             }
         };
     }

  Again, the first thing we do is turn on the activity
  indicator to let the user know we are processing their
  request.

  We use the app's ``login()`` method, which takes
  credentials that correspond to the email/password
  authentication provider. As in the ``signUp()`` method, we
  pass the text values from our UI into the credentials.

  Once again, in the completion handler we must dispatch
  back to the main thread. Once on the main thread, we turn
  off the activity indicator and handle any errors.

  If login succeeded, we can go ahead and open the {+realm+} to be used on the
  next page. To do that, we decide on a :term:`partition value`. The partition
  value determines which :term:`{+realm+}` we are reading and writing data in.

  You may have noticed that we hardcoded the partition value to the phrase "My
  Project". This makes it so that all tasks in the {+app+} -- even those created
  on a second device by a different user -- belong to the same project. In a
  future tutorial, we will allow the creation of different projects with
  different access permissions.

  After deciding the partition value, we open the {+realm+} with that partition
  value and pass it to the next view controller. It's a good idea to pass the
  {+realm+} rather than opening it in the next view controller itself, because
  if the {+realm+} fails to open for some reason, you can handle the error
  before loading the view.

  .. admonition:: Check the Logs Tab in the {+ui+}
     :class: note

     On that note, when working with {+sync+}, remember to check the
     :guilabel:`Logs` page in the {+ui+}. That page usually contains additional
     information that can help you troubleshoot any issues you may encounter.

  At this point, you might want to comment out the line that
  mentions ``TasksViewController``, which we haven't defined
  yet, and try out your new sign up and sign in
  functionality.
---
title: Define Your {+frontend-schema+}
ref: define-your-frontend-schema
content: |
  Now that we have implemented authentication functionality,
  let's define a model that our app can use. 

  Create a new, empty Swift file called Models.swift by
  selecting ``File > New > File...`` in Xcode and using the
  "Swift File" template.

  We need to define the models of our schema. If you followed the backend setup
  guide for this tutorial, you can view these models on the :guilabel:`SDKs`
  page in the {+ui+} under the :guilabel:`Swift` tab.

  Copy the following code into Models.swift:

  .. code-block:: swift

     import Foundation
     import RealmSwift

     typealias ProjectId = String

     class Project: Object {
         @objc dynamic var _id: ObjectId = ObjectId.generate()
         @objc dynamic var _partition: String? = nil
         @objc dynamic var name: String = ""
         override static func primaryKey() -> String? {
             return "_id"
         }
         
         convenience init(partition: String, name: String) {
             self.init()
             self._partition = partition
             self.name = name
         }
     }

     class User: Object {
         @objc dynamic var _id: String = ""
         @objc dynamic var _partition: String? = nil
         @objc dynamic var image: String? = nil
         @objc dynamic var name: String = ""
         override static func primaryKey() -> String? {
             return "_id"
         }
     }

     enum TaskStatus: String {
     case Open
     case InProgress
     case Complete
     }

     class Task: Object {
         @objc dynamic var _id: ObjectId = ObjectId.generate()
         @objc dynamic var _partition: ProjectId? = nil
         @objc dynamic var assignee: User?
         @objc dynamic var name = ""
         @objc dynamic var status = TaskStatus.Open.rawValue

         var statusEnum: TaskStatus {
             get {
                 return TaskStatus(rawValue: status) ?? .Open
             }
             set {
                 status = newValue.rawValue
             }
         }

         override static func primaryKey() -> String? {
             return "_id"
         }
        
         convenience init(partition: String, name: String) {
             self.init()
             self._partition = partition
             self.name = name
         }
     }

  This declares the class Task as a subclass of the {+service-short+} Object
  class with the properties we need. It also declares the other models we need
  to interact with the backend schema we defined. We will use those other models
  in a future tutorial.

  Every object we sync needs a :term:`partition value`. We
  configured our {+app+} to use a string called
  ``_partition`` as the :term:`partition key`. This is
  flexible, but it might be difficult for anyone reading our
  code to know that the Task's partition value should be a
  specific project ID. To give future developers (and
  ourselves) a hint as we build on the app, we use an alias
  for ``String`` called ``ProjectId`` as the partition value
  type.

  To represent the task status, we use an enum. To represent
  this in {+backend+}, we need to convert the enum to a
  string. So, we make the synced property (notice: ``@objc
  dynamic var``) ``status`` of string type and add a
  non-synced property (notice it is not marked ``@objc
  dynamic var``) called ``statusEnum`` of enum type. The
  ``statusEnum`` property controls the ``status`` variable.

title: Implement the Tasks List
ref: implement-the-tasks-list
content: |
  Create a new Cocoa Touch class called based on
  UIViewController called TasksViewController. This screen
  will allow users to view, create, modify, and delete
  tasks as well as log out.

  .. figure:: /images/swift-tutorial-tasks-view.png
     :alt: The finished tasks view controller
     :width: 300px
     :lightbox:

  To begin, declare some member variables at the top of the
  new class:

  .. code-block:: swift
     
     class TasksViewController: UIViewController {
         let partitionValue: String
         let realm: Realm
         let tasks: Results<Task>
         let tableView = UITableView()

  Initialize these values with a new ``init()`` method declared next:

  .. code-block:: swift

     required init(projectRealm: Realm) {
         // Ensure the realm was opened with sync.
         guard let syncConfiguration = projectRealm.configuration.syncConfiguration else {
             fatalError("Sync configuration not found! Realm not opened with sync?");
         }

         realm = projectRealm

         // Partition value must be of string type.
         partitionValue = syncConfiguration.partitionValue.stringValue!

         // Access all tasks in the realm, sorted by _id so that the ordering is defined.
         // Only tasks with the project ID as the partition key value will be in the realm.
         tasks = realm.objects(Task.self).sorted(byKeyPath: "_id")

         super.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil)
     }

     // Implement this overload of init to satisfy the UIViewController subclass requirement.
     required init?(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) {
         fatalError("init(coder:) has not been implemented")
     }

  This code first checks that the passed-in {+realm+} was opened with sync.
  Since we know we only come to this screen from the WelcomeViewController after
  successful login and with a sync-enabled {+realm+}, this is really just to
  protect against future programmer errors.

  We read the :term:`partition value` from the {+realm+}. We'll use that when
  creating Tasks. Then we query for the :ref:`collection
  <ios-client-collections>` of all tasks within that {+realm+}. We sort the
  Tasks by their ``_id`` property so that they always appear in the same
  relative order.

  This collection is live: as we add, remove, and update tasks -- even from
  another device -- this collection always contains the latest results of its
  associated query. We'll get to reacting to these updates later. First, let's
  continue setting up the TasksViewController.

title: Configure the Task List UI
ref: configure-the-task-list-ui
content: |
  Now set up the UI in the ``viewDidLoad`` method. Add a
  "log out" button on the top left, a title, a table view to
  display the tasks, and an "add" button on the top right
  that create tasks:

  .. code-block:: swift
   
     override func viewDidLoad() {
         // Configure the view.
         super.viewDidLoad()

         navigationItem.leftBarButtonItem = UIBarButtonItem(title: "Log Out", style: .plain, target: self, action: #selector(logOutButtonDidClick))

         title = "My Project"
         tableView.dataSource = self
         tableView.delegate = self
         view.addSubview(tableView)
         tableView.frame = self.view.frame
         navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem = UIBarButtonItem(barButtonSystemItem: .add, target: self, action: #selector(addButtonDidClick))
     }
---
title: Implement the Log Out Functionality
ref: implement-the-log-out-functionality
content: |
  When we created the "log out" button, we wired it to a
  ``logOutButtonDidClick`` method that we hadn't defined
  yet. Let's define it now in the TasksViewController:

  .. code-block:: swift

     @objc func logOutButtonDidClick() {
         let alertController = UIAlertController(title: "Log Out", message: "", preferredStyle: .alert);
         alertController.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: "Yes, Log Out", style: .destructive, handler: {
             alert -> Void in
             print("Logging out...");
             app.currentUser()?.logOut(completion: {(error) in
                 DispatchQueue.main.sync {
                     print("Logged out!");
                     self.navigationController?.setViewControllers([WelcomeViewController()], animated: true)
                 }
             })
         }))
         alertController.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: "Cancel", style: .cancel, handler: nil))
         self.present(alertController, animated: true, completion: nil)
     }

  This calls the ``logOut`` method on the current user of the app we
  created earlier. In the completion handler, we dispatch to the main thread so
  that we can navigate back to the welcome screen.
---
title: Implement the UITableViewDelegate and UITableViewDataSource Protocols
ref: implement-delegate-protocols
content: |
  In order to act as the table view delegate and data source
  for the table view, we need to subscribe to the
  UITableViewDelegate and UITableViewDataSource protocols.
  Add these to the TasksViewController class definition near
  the top of the file. When done, the opening line of your
  class definition should look like this:

  .. code-block:: swift

     class TasksViewController: UIViewController, UITableViewDelegate, UITableViewDataSource {

  Now we can implement the ``numberOfRowsInSection`` method for that protocol:

  .. code-block:: swift

     func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -> Int {
         return tasks.count
     }

  ...and the ``cellForRowAt`` method, which defines what
  information a given cell contains:

  .. code-block:: swift
     
     func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {
         // This defines how the Tasks in the list look.
         // We want the task name on the left and some indication of its status on the right.
         let task = tasks[indexPath.row]
         let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: "Cell") ?? UITableViewCell(style: .default, reuseIdentifier: "Cell")
         cell.selectionStyle = .none
         cell.textLabel?.text = task.name
         switch (task.statusEnum) {
         case .Open:
             cell.accessoryView = nil
             cell.accessoryType = UITableViewCell.AccessoryType.none
         case .InProgress:
             let label = UILabel.init(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 100, height: 20))
             label.text = "In Progress"
             cell.accessoryView = label
         case .Complete:
             cell.accessoryView = nil
             cell.accessoryType = UITableViewCell.AccessoryType.checkmark
         }
         return cell
     }

  In this case, we define each task cell to have its task
  name on the left and a representation of its current
  status on the right:

  - No icon for the "Open" status.
  - A checkmark for the "Completed" status.
  - The text "In Progress" for the "In Progress" status.
---
title: Allow the User to Add Tasks
ref: add-tasks
content: |
  When we created the "add" button, we wired it to an
  ``addButtonDidClick`` method that we hadn't defined yet.
  Let's define it now in the TasksViewController:

  .. code-block:: swift

     @objc func addButtonDidClick() {
         let alertController = UIAlertController(title: "Add Task", message: "", preferredStyle: .alert)

         // When the user clicks the add button, present them with a dialog to enter the task name.
         alertController.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: "Save", style: .default, handler: { alert -> Void in
             let textField = alertController.textFields![0] as UITextField

             // Create a new Task with the text that the user entered.
             let task = Task(partition: self.partitionValue, name: textField.text ?? "New Task")

             // Any writes to the Realm must occur in a write block.
             try! self.realm.write {
                 // Add the Task to the Realm. That's it!
                 self.realm.add(task)
             }
         }))
         alertController.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: "Cancel", style: .cancel, handler: nil))
         alertController.addTextField(configurationHandler: { (textField: UITextField!) -> Void in
             textField.placeholder = "New Task Name"
         })

         // Show the dialog.
         self.present(alertController, animated: true, completion: nil)
     }

  When the user clicks the "add" button, we present a dialog
  prompting the user for a new task name. After they enter
  the name and press "Save", we construct a new task object
  with that name.

  We must set the partition value of the new task to the
  partition value that we used to open the {+realm+}.

  Then, we open a write transaction and add the new task to
  the realm.
---
title: Delete Tasks
ref: delete-tasks
content: |

  Users can delete tasks with a swipe. To handle swipes,
  implement the following method in TasksViewController:

  .. code-block:: swift

     func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, commit editingStyle: UITableViewCell.EditingStyle, forRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) {
         guard editingStyle == .delete else { return }
         
         // User can swipe to delete items.
         let task = tasks[indexPath.row]
         
         // All modifications to a realm must happen in a write block.
         try! realm.write {
             // Delete the Task.
             realm.delete(task)
         }
     }

---
title: Modify Tasks
ref: modify-tasks
content: |

  When the user selects a task in the list, we want to present them with a list
  of actions. This is how they can set the status of a task. We can expand
  functionality by adding more actions later. When finished, the task list will
  look something like this:

  .. figure:: /images/swift-tutorial-action-list.png
     :alt: The finished action list
     :width: 300px
     :lightbox:

  Implement the ``didSelectRowAt`` method as follows:

  .. code-block:: swift

     func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, didSelectRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) {
         // User selected a task in the table. We will present a list of actions that the user can perform on this task.
         let task = tasks[indexPath.row] 

         // Create the AlertController and add its actions.
         let actionSheet: UIAlertController = UIAlertController(title: task.name, message: "Select an action", preferredStyle: .actionSheet)

         actionSheet.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: "Cancel", style: .cancel) { _ in
                 print("Cancel")
             })

         // If the task is not in the Open state, we can set it to open. Otherwise, that action will not be available.
         // We do this for the other two states -- InProgress and Complete.
         if (task.statusEnum != .Open) {
             actionSheet.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: "Open", style: .default) { _ in
                     // Any modifications to managed objects must occur in a write block.
                     // When we modify the Task's state, that change is automatically reflected in the realm.
                     try! self.realm.write {
                         task.statusEnum = .Open
                     }
                 })
         }

         if (task.statusEnum != .InProgress) {
             actionSheet.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: "Start Progress", style: .default) { _ in
                     try! self.realm.write {
                         task.statusEnum = .InProgress
                     }
                 })
         }

         if (task.statusEnum != .Complete) {
             actionSheet.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: "Complete", style: .default) { _ in
                     try! self.realm.write {
                         task.statusEnum = .Complete
                     }
                 })
         }

         // Show the actions list.
         self.present(actionSheet, animated: true, completion: nil)
     }

  We dynamically assemble the list of actions depending on
  the current status. Ultimately, each action just modifies
  the task object directly.

  The important thing to note is that every modification --
  whether adding, deleting, or modifying -- is always in a
  ``realm.write`` transaction block. {+service-short+} does
  not allow any writes outside of a transaction.

---
title: React to Changes
ref: react-to-changes
content: |

  So far, we have implemented functionality to create, read,
  update, and delete tasks in the app. To react to these
  changes and automatically update the UI to reflect new
  state, let's use {+service-short+}'s :ref:`notification
  system <ios-client-notifications>`.

  Add a new property to the TasksViewController class:

  .. code-block:: swift

     var notificationToken: NotificationToken?

  In the ``init()`` method implemented earlier, add the
  following code:

  .. code-block:: swift

     // Observe the tasks for changes.
     notificationToken = tasks.observe { [weak self] (changes) in
         guard let tableView = self?.tableView else { return }
         switch changes {
         case .initial:
             // Results are now populated and can be accessed without blocking the UI
             tableView.reloadData()
         case .update(_, let deletions, let insertions, let modifications):
             // Query results have changed, so apply them to the UITableView.
             tableView.beginUpdates()
             // It's important to be sure to always update a table in this order:
             // deletions, insertions, then updates. Otherwise, you could be unintentionally
             // updating at the wrong index!
             tableView.deleteRows(at: deletions.map({ IndexPath(row: $0, section: 0) }),
                 with: .automatic)
             tableView.insertRows(at: insertions.map({ IndexPath(row: $0, section: 0) }),
                 with: .automatic)
             tableView.reloadRows(at: modifications.map({ IndexPath(row: $0, section: 0) }),
                 with: .automatic)
             tableView.endUpdates()
         case .error(let error):
             // An error occurred while opening the Realm file on the background worker thread
             fatalError("\(error)")
         }
     }

  This observes the tasks in the {+realm+} for changes.
  Upon change, we update the table view accordingly.

  Observation continues as long as the notification token is
  valid. That's why we stored a strong reference to the
  result of ``tasks.observe`` in a property. When finished
  observing -- for example, because the user navigated to
  another screen -- you should deallocate this notification
  handler. The ``deinit`` method is a convenient place to
  call the ``invalidate`` method on the token. Add the
  following code to the TasksViewController class:

  .. code-block:: swift

     deinit {
         // Always invalidate any notification tokens when you are done with them.
         notificationToken?.invalidate()
     }

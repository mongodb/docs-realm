  In the {+leftnav+}, click :guilabel:`Schema` beneath :guilabel:`Data
  Access` to open the schema editor. Realm scans your linked cluster for
  existing collections and lists them on the left side of the schema
  editor.

  By default, you see all the collections in your linked Atlas cluster.
  Any collection that has a schema shows a bolded name in this list, 
  while a collection with no schema shows a light-gray, italicized name.

  From here, you can remove the schema for a single collection, or 
  remove the schema for all collections.

  1. Hover over the collection name, and a :guilabel:`...` menu appears.

  #. When you click this :guilabel:`...` element, you get two options. One of
     them is to :guilabel:`Delete Schema from this Collection`. Choose this 
     option.

  #. A modal pops up asking you to confirm that you want to delete the schema
     for the collection. Press the :guilabel:`Delete` button.

  #. If you have already terminated {+sync+}, Realm deletes the schema. If you have 
     not yet :ref:`terminated {+sync+} <terminating-realm-sync>`, 
     a modal displays, letting you know that this is a destructive change and 
     clients will experience a :ref:`Client Reset <client-resets>`. If you'd
     like to continue, press the :guilabel:`Save Changes & Reinitialize Sync`.

  At this point, the collection no longer has a schema, and
  you can choose to :ref:`generate a schema <enforce-a-schema>` or 
  :ref:`enable Development Mode <concept-development-mode>`.

  If breaking changes impact multiple collections and you don't want to 
  remove the schema collection-by-collection, you may remove all the schemas 
  in a linked Atlas cluster. 

  The first item in the :guilabel:`Collections` pane is the name of the 
  linked data source. You can see a :guilabel:`...` menu next to the name. 
  
  1. Select the :guilabel:`...` element. 
  
  #. You can see a few options; the last of which is 
     :guilabel:`Delete Schemas from All Collections`. Select this option.

  #. A modal pops up asking you to confirm that you want to delete all 
     schemas for the data source. Press the :guilabel:`Delete` button.

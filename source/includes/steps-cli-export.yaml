title: Run the App Export Command
ref: run-the-app-export-command
content: |
  You can export an application's configuration directory by specifying its remote
  App ID and an optional local path. If you do not specify a local path, the
  command outputs the configuration directory in the current working directory.

  .. code-block:: shell

     realm-cli pull --remote=<App ID> --local=<Output Directory Path> [options]
  
  .. warning::

     The directory specified by ``--local`` must not already exist, otherwise
     {+cli-bin+} throws an error and does not pull the configuration files.

  The command also supports :ref:`additional flags <realm-cli-pull>` that you 
  can optionally include to customize your app. The following table lists 
  common flags you might use:

  .. list-table::
     
     * - ``--include-dependencies``
       - If specified, exports any external dependencies included
         in a ``node_modules`` archive in the ``/functions`` directory of your
         {+app+}.
     
     * - ``--include-hosting``
       - If specified, exports all hosted static assets in the ``hosting/files``
         directory of your {+app+}.

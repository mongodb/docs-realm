  Navigate to the :github:`realm-dotnet repository releases
  <realm/realm-dotnet/releases>` page, and scroll down to the release you want
  to use in your project. If you are unsure of which release to use, you can use

title: Add the Tarball to Your Projects Package Manager
ref: swiftpm-specify-options
content: |

  Move your downloaded {+service-short+} .NET SDK tarball inside of your
  project. You can do this by dragging and dropping the file into your project's
  folder. Copying the tarball to your project folder and committing it to version
  control ensures other developers working on the project can just clone the
  repository and build without manually downloading the Realm dependency.

  Next, you must load the tarball into your project using the `Unity package manager
  <https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui.html>`_.
  
  To open the package manager, click the :guilabel:`Window` tab on the top of
  the Unity menu. Click :guilabel:`Package Manager` from the :guilabel:`Window
  dropdown`. Once the package manager model opens, click the :guilabel:`+` icon
  in the top left corner of the model. Select the :guilabel:`Add package from
  tarball...` option.

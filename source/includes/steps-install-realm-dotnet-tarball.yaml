  Before you begin using {+service+} within your Unity project, you must
  download the {+service-short+} .NET SDK. 

  Navigate to the :github:`realm-dotnet repository releases
  <realm/realm-dotnet/releases>` page, and scroll down to the release you want
  to use in your project. If you are unsure of which release to use, you can use
  the one labelled **"latest release"** on the left row.

title: Add the Tarball to Your Projects Package Manager
ref: swiftpm-specify-options
content: |

  Since Unity does not save the tarball within your project automatically, you
  must move your downloaded {+service-short+} .NET SDK tarball to your project
  folder. You can do this by dragging and dropping the file to your project's
  "Packages" folder. This ensures that the {+service-short+} .NET SDK is bundled
  with your project. Next, you must load the tarball into your project using the
  Unity `package manager <https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui.html>`_. 
  
  To open the package manager, click the :guilabel:`Window` tab on the top of
  the Unity menu. Click :guilabel:`Package Manager` from the :guilabel:`Window
  dropdown`. Once the package manager model opens, click the :guilabel:`+` icon
  in the top left corner of the model. Select the :guilabel:`Add package from
  tarball...` option.

  Select your **"Packages/io.realm.unity-bundled-<version-number>.tgz"** file to
  begin importing your project.

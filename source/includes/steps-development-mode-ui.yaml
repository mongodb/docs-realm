  While development mode is enabled, Realm maps every synced object type to its
  own collection in the linked cluster. The collections use the pluralized name
  of the object type and are located in a specific database.

  Determine which database in the linked cluster you want to contain the synced
  data and then enter it into the :guilabel:`Define a Database Name` input.

title: Choose a Partition Key
ref: choose-a-partition-key
content: |
  The sync :term:`partition key` is a field in every synced document that maps
  each document to a client-side realm. Sync rules apply at the partition level,
  so it is particularly important to consider your data model and access
  patterns. For more information on partition keys and how to choose one, see
  :ref:`Partition Atlas Data into Realms <partitioning>`.
  
  Once you have decided which field to use, enter the field name into the
  :guilabel:`Choose A Partition Key` input.

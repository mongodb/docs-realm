  of the object type and are located in a specific database.

title: Choose a Partition Key
ref: choose-a-partition-key
content: |
  The sync :term:`partition key` is a field in every synced document that maps
  each document to a client-side realm. Sync rules apply at the partition level,
  so it is particularly important to consider your data model and access
  patterns. For more information on partition keys and how to choose one, see
  :ref:`Partitions <sync-partitions>`.
  
  Once you have decided which field to use, enter the field name into the
  :guilabel:`Choose A Partition Key` input.

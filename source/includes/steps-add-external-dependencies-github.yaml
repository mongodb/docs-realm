  Pull your {+app+} to your device with the command: 

  .. code-block::

     realm-cli pull

  #. Create a ``package.json`` in the ``/functions`` directory of 
     your {+app+}. You can do this by copying in an existing ``package.json`` file
     or running ``npm init`` and following the prompts.
  #. Add dependencies by running ``npm install <dependency-name>``.

title: Push the Dependencies to Github
ref: add-external-dependencies-github-push-dependencies
content: |
  Git Push the latest version of your app with all the dependencies in the ``package.json`` 
  to Github with a command such as: 

  .. code-block::

     git push origin main

---
title: Check Operation Success
ref: add-external-dependencies-github-check-operation-success
content: |
  The {+service-short+} GitHub app automatically deploys your updated
  app configuration after you push the commit. You can check the status
  of the deployment and confirm that all packages were successfully
  added from the :guilabel:`Deployment` screen of the {+ui+}.

  If anything fails during deployment, none of the dependencies are
  installed. Remove the failing dependencies from the ``package.json``
  file and try again.

  To create new incoming webhook with :doc:`realm-cli
  </deploy/realm-cli-reference>`, you need a
  previously created :ref:`application configuration <application-directory>`.

  You can :doc:`export </deploy/export-realm-app>` your application from the
  :guilabel:`Import/Export App` tab of the :guilabel:`Deploy` page in the
  {+ui+}, or by running the following command from an authenticated instance of
  :doc:`realm-cli </deploy/realm-cli-reference>`:

  .. code-block:: shell

     realm-cli export --app-id=<App ID>

title: Create a Service Configuration Directory
ref: create-a-service-configuration-file
content: |
  Create a new subdirectory in the ``/services`` folder of the
  application directory that you exported. The name of the subdirectory
  should match the configured name of the service.

  .. code-block:: shell

     mkdir -p services/myService
---
title: Add a Service Configuration File
ref: add-a-service-configuration-file
content: |
  Add a file named ``config.json`` to the new service directory.
  The configuration file should have the following form:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     {
       "type": <boolean>,
       "name": <string>,
       "config": <document>
     }

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 10 30

     * - Configuration Value
       - Description

     * - :guilabel:`Service Type`

         | *type*

       - Required. The type of the configured service.

     * - :guilabel:`Service Name`

         | *name*

       - Required. The name of the configured service.

     * - :guilabel:`Configuration`

         | *config*

       - Required. A document that contains configuration values
         specific to the type of the service you are configuring. To

  Once you have added the appropriate configuration files to the service
  subdirectory, you can import the service into your application.

  Navigate to the root of the application directory and run the
  following command:

  .. code-block:: shell

     realm-cli import

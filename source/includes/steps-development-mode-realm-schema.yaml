title: Enable ``Development Mode``
ref: enable-development-mode
content: |

  You can alter or create a Realm Object Model through your mobile
  client SDK. Changes to your Realm Object Model will only be allowed
  when :guilabel:`Development Mode` is on in the MongoDB Realm UI.
  MongoDB Realm will reflect these changes to your Realm Object Model in
  your Realm Schema used for Atlas.
  
  To enable :guilabel:`Development
  Mode`, navigate to the ``SDKs`` page, the "Development Mode is ON"
  modal will appear immediately, indicating that Realm Object Modal
  changes from your mobile client are now allowed.

title: Edit Your Realm Object Model
ref: edit-realm-object-model
content: |

  As your application-needs grow and change, you will need to modify
  your data model with it to enforce different data validation rules
  based on those changes. While :guilabel:`Development Mode` is on you
  can edit your Realm Object Model in your client code.

  .. example::

     A group is developing a social media application. When the group
     first developed their application, a user's birthday was a required
     field of the User's data model. However, due to privacy concerns
     over the amount of user data that is stored, management creates a
     new requirement to make the user's birthday field an optional
     field. Application developers turn on :guilabel:`Development Mode`
     in the MongoDB Realm UI and then edit their user model within
     their client code. 

     .. code-block:: javascript
        
       const realmObjectModel = { 
         name: 'User',
         properties: {
           name:     'string',
           birthday:    {type: 'date', optional: true}, // developers set optional: true to adhere to the new requirement
         }
       };

       Realm.open({schema: realmObjectModel})
         .then(realm => {
           // ... use the realm instance to read and modify data
         })

title: Update Your Realm Schema with the Realm Object Model Changes
ref: update-realm-schema
content: |

  Once you make changes to your Realm Object Model, your Realm Schema
  should reflect those changes so that Atlas can enforce data validation
  with the updated data model configuration. Turn off
  :guilabel:`Development Mode` by clicking the "Turn Dev Mode Off"
  button on the top right-hand side of the ``SDKs`` page. Turning off
  ``Development Mode`` will prevent data model changes, and generate a
  Realm Schema based on your updated Realm Object Model.

title: View Your Realm Schema
ref: view-realm-schema
content: |

  Once you turn off :guilabel:`Development Mode`, the "Development Mode
  is OFF" modal will appear. The modal indicates that MongoDB Realm will
  stop accepting new data model changes from clients and that MongoDB
  Realm has generated a Realm Schema from your Realm Object Model.  This
  Realm Schema is used for your Atlas Cluster to enforce data validation
  using the configuration specified in the Realm Schema. To view your
  updated Realm Schema, click the "View my Realm Schema" button.

  .. note:: 

    To make future data model updates from your mobile client code, you
    will have to turn :guilabel:`Development Mode` back on.

title: Update Your Local Application
ref: update-your-local-application
content: |
  To configure development mode through the CLI, you need an :ref:`up-to-date
  application directory <application-directory>`. To export the latest version
  of your app, run the following command from your shell:

  .. code-block:: shell
     
     realm-cli export --app-id=<Your App ID>

title: Select a Cluster to Sync
ref: select-a-cluster-to-sync
content: |
  You can enable development mode sync for a single :term:`linked cluster` in
  your application. If you have not yet linked the cluster to your application,
  follow the :ref:`Link a MongoDB Atlas Cluster <link-a-data-source>` guide to
  link it before you continue.

  Determine which cluster you want to use and then open its configuration file.
  Add the ``config.sync`` field with the following value:

  .. code-block:: json
     
     {
       "config": {
         "sync": {
           "state": "enabled",
           "database_name": "<Target Database Name>",
           "partition": {
             "key": "<Partition Key Field>",
             "type": "<Partition Key Type>",
             "permissions": {
               "read": true,
               "write": true
             }
           }
         },
         ...
       },
       ...
     }
---
title: Choose a Target Database
ref: choose-a-target-database
content: |
  While development mode is enabled, Realm maps every synced object type to its
  own collection in the linked cluster. The collections use the pluralized name
  of the object type and are located in a specific database.

  Determine which database in the linked cluster you want to contain the synced
  data and then specify the database name in ``config.sync.database_name``:

  .. code-block:: json
     :emphasize-lines: 5
     
     {
       "config": {
         "sync": {
           "state": "enabled",
           "database_name": "myDevModeDatabase",
           "partition": {
             "key": "<Partition Key Field>",
             "type": "<Partition Key Type>",
             "permissions": {
               "read": true,
               "write": true
             }
           }
         },
         ...
       },
       ...
     }

title: Choose a Partition Key
ref: choose-a-partition-key
content: |
  The sync :term:`partition key` is a field in every synced document that maps
  each document to a client-side realm. Sync rules apply at the partition level,
  so it's particularly important to consider your data model and access
  patterns. For more information on partition keys and how to choose one, see
  :ref:`Partition Atlas Data into Realms <partitioning>`.

  Once you have decided which field to use, update ``config.sync.partition``
  with the partition key field name in the ``key`` field and the partition key
  type in the ``type`` field.

  .. code-block:: json
     :emphasize-lines: 7, 8

     {
       "config": {
         "sync": {
           "state": "enabled",
           "database_name": "myDevModeDatabase",
           "partition": {
             "key": "_partition",
             "type": "string",
             "permissions": {
               "read": true,
               "write": true
             }
           }
         },
         ...
       },
       ...
     }

title: Enable Development Mode
ref: enable-development-mode
content: |
  You can turn development mode on and off by setting a boolean value for
  ``sync.development_mode_enabled`` in your app's ``config.json`` file. To
  enable dev mode, set the value to ``true``:

  .. code-block:: json
     :caption: config.json
     
     {
       ...,
       "sync": {
         "development_mode_enabled": true
       }
     }
---
title: Deploy the Updated App Configuration
ref: deploy-the-updated-app-configuration
content: |
  Now that you've configured development mode and specified that it's enabled,
  you can deploy your changes to turn it on.

  To deploy your changes, import your app configuration:

  .. code-block:: shell
     
     realm-cli import

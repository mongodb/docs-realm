title: (Optional) List All Apps
ref: list-apps
content: |
  Although the ``delete`` command will show you a list of apps available to delete, 
  You may want to use the ``list`` command to see all your apps and find out which 
  you plan to delete before running the ``delete`` command.

  .. code-block:: shell

     realm-cli apps list 

  For more details about each app, you can use:
  
  .. code-block:: shell

     realm-cli apps describe 

  .. seealso::

     For more details and additional flags, see the CLI documentation for the 
     :ref:`list <realm-cli-apps-list>` 
     and :ref:`describe <realm-cli-apps-describe>` commands.

title: Run the App Delete Command
ref: run-the-app-delete-command
content: |
  The CLI can delete one or more apps with the following command:

  .. code-block:: shell

     realm-cli apps delete
  
  If you have more than one {+app+}, you will be prompted to select one or 
  more apps that you would like to delete from a list of all your {+app+}s.
  
  If you already know the name or id of the app you would like to delete, you can specify it:

  .. code-block:: shell

     realm-cli apps delete --app <name or id>

  .. seealso::

     For more details and additional flags, see the
     CLI documentation for the :ref:`delete <realm-cli-apps-delete>` command.

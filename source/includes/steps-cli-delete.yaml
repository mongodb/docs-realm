  The CLI can delete one or more apps with the following command:

  .. code-block:: shell

     realm-cli apps delete
  
  If you have more than one {+app+}, you will be prompted to select one or 
  more apps that you would like to delete from a list of all your {+app+}s.
  
  If you already know the name or id of the app you would like to delete, you can specify it:

  .. code-block:: shell

     realm-cli apps delete --app <name or id>

  .. seealso::

     For more details and additional flags, see the
     :ref:`CLI documentation for the delete command <realm-cli-apps-delete>`.

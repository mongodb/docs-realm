title: Acquire the Custom Domain Name
ref: acquire-the-custom-domain-name

  You must own the custom domain name that you want to serve content
  from. If you don't already own the domain that you want to use, you
  will need to purchase it from a domain name registrar.

title: Specify the Custom Domain in Realm
ref: specify-the-custom-domain-in-realm
content: |
  You need to provide your custom domain name to {+service+} before it will
  serve content from the domain. To specify the domain:

  1. Click :guilabel:`Hosting` in the {+leftnav+}.

  2. Click the :guilabel:`Settings` tab.

  3. Under :guilabel:`Custom Domain`, set the toggle to
     :guilabel:`Enabled`.

  4. Enter your custom domain in the input box under the
     :guilabel:`Enabled` toggle. This value should be the root domain
     without any subdomains. For example, you should enter
     ``example.com`` instead of ``www.example.com``.

  5. Click :guilabel:`Save`.

  .. note::

    If an error is encountered during custom domain name validation,
    {+service-short+} sends the project owner an email alerting them of the
    issue.

title: Add a Validation CNAME Record
ref: add-a-validation-cname-record
content: |
  To verify that you own the domain you must add a new :wikipedia:`CNAME
  record <CNAME_record>` in your domain's DNS configuration. The
  :guilabel:`Custom Domain` section will include an information box that
  lists the host name and target value to use in the record.

  Once you have added the validation record it may take some time for the
  DNS record to propagate. {+service-short+} will periodically check the domain's
  DNS records for the validation ``CNAME`` and will mark the domain as
  verified if it finds the record.

  .. note::

     {+service-short+} may not be able to find the validation record if your DNS
     provider proxies requests for the domain. If {+service-short+} cannot validate
     your domain, ensure that you have disabled any HTTP proxies for the
     validation CNAME record on your DNS provider.

  .. note::

     If an error is encountered during custom domain name validation,
     {+service-short+} sends the project owner an email alerting them of the
     issue.

title: Add a Redirect CNAME Record
ref: add-a-redirect-cname-record
content: |
  Once {+service-short+} has verified your domain, all that's left is to add a
  ``CNAME`` DNS record for your domain that points to the default {+service-short+}
  domain. Use the following host name and target value:

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 10 30

     * - Value
       - Description

     * - Host Name
       - A subdomain such as ``www``.

     * - Target
       - The default domain for your application. This value is listed
         as the :guilabel:`Realm Domain` in the :guilabel:`Settings` tab
         of the :guilabel:`Hosting` page. The default domain has the
         following form:

         .. code-block:: none

            <Your App ID>.mongodbstitch.com
...

  You can use any hosted file as your custom 404 page. It's common to
  use an HTML file that incorporates the following elements:
  - A short message indicating the error, e.g. "This page does not
    exist."
  - Alternative links or options for the user to continue navigating.

  Once you've created the custom 404 file, you need to :doc:`upload it
  to Stitch </hosting/upload-content-to-stitch>`. To upload the file,
  navigate to the :guilabel:`Hosting` screen of the Stitch UI, click
  :guilabel:`Upload Files`, and select the custom HTML file.

  Once you have successfully uploaded the 404 file, all that's left is
  to configure Stitch to serve that file instead of the default 404
  page.
  1. On the :guilabel:`Hosting` page, click the :guilabel:`Settings`
     tab.
  2. Under :guilabel:`Custom 404 Page`, click :guilabel:`Choose File`.
  3. Select your custom 404 file from the list.
  4. Click :guilabel:`Save`.
  Once you have updated the :guilabel:`Hosting` configuration, Stitch
  will begin serving your custom file instead of the default 404 page.

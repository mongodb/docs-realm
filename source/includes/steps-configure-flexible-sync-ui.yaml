title: Navigate to the {+sync-short+} Configuration Screen
ref: navigate-to-the-{+sync-short+}-configuration-screen
content: |
  To define {+sync-short+} rules and enable {+sync-short+} for your application, navigate to the
  :guilabel:`{+sync-short+}` configuration screen through the {+leftnav+}.
---
title: Select Development Details
ref: select-development-details
content: |
  Under the :guilabel:`Select Development Details` heading, you can configure
  various development details, such as {+sync-short+} types, Development Mode,
  and a cluster to {+sync-short+}.

  Below the :guilabel:`{+sync-short+} types` subheading, select the :guilabel:`Flexible`
  option to enable Flexible {+sync-short+}.
  
  Next, under the :guilabel:`Development Mode` subheading, you can choose to
  toggle :ref:`Development Mode <enable-disable-development-mode>` on/off.
  Enabling ``Development Mode`` allows you to define schemas directly in your
  client application code and is suitable if you are in development and do not
  have application data in Atlas yet.
  
  Finally, you can enable {+sync-short+} for a single :term:`linked cluster` in your
  application. Determine which cluster you want to use and select it from
  the :guilabel:`Select Cluster To {+sync-short+}` dropdown menu.

  .. important:: Ineligible Clusters

     Flexible Sync requires MongoDB 5.0. Clusters display as gray and not-selectable
     in the UI when they do not meet the requirements for Flexible Sync.

title: Select Queryable Fields
ref: select-queryable-fields
content: |
  When configuring Flexible {+sync-short+}, specify one or more :ref:`queryable
  fields <queryable-fields>` from your {+sync-short+} Schema.
  
  To configure queryable fields for your application, navigate to the
  :guilabel:`Select Queryable Fields` heading. Select up to 10 existing fields
  from your schema to query on. If you want to create a new field(s) to
  construct a query on, you must define a database and enable ``Development Mode``.

title: Define Read & Write Permissions
ref: define-read-write-permissions
content: |
  In the :guilabel:`Define Permissions` section, you can define :ref:`JSON
  expressions <expressions>` to tell {+service+} whether a user has read or
  write permissions on a given document. {+service-short+} evaluates these
  expressions for a user when that user opens a {+realm+}.

  The ``Apply When`` :ref:`expression <expressions>` determines
  if a role applies to a given document.

title: Turn On Sync
ref: turn-on-sync
content: |
  Now that you've configured rules for your synced cluster, all that's left to
  do is turn on {+sync-short+} for client applications. Click :guilabel:`Enable {+sync-short+}`,
  take note of any recommendations that appear and then confirm your choice.

title: Export Your Realm Application
ref: export-your-application
content: |
  To define roles and permissions with :doc:`realm-cli
  </deploy/realm-cli-reference>` you need to export an
  :ref:`application directory <application-directory>` for your
  application.

  You can :doc:`export </deploy/export-realm-app>` your
  application from the :guilabel:`Export` tab of the
  :guilabel:`Settings` page in the {+ui+}, or by running the
  following command from an authenticated instance of :doc:`realm-cli
  </deploy/realm-cli-reference>`:

  .. code-block:: shell

     realm-cli export --app-id=<App ID>

title: Add a Rule Configuration File
ref: add-a-rule-configuration-file
content: |
  The rules for a MongoDB collection are configured in the ``rules``
  subdirectory of the :doc:`linked cluster </mongodb/link-a-cluster>`'s
  service directory. The rules configuration file is a JSON file with
  the same name as the collection namespace.

  For example, the rules for the collection ``app.users`` in the
  ``mongodb-atlas`` cluster are defined in the file
  ``/services/mongodb-atlas/rules/app.users.json``.

  If you have not configured rules for the collection, add a
  configuration file for it to the ``rules`` directory:

  .. code-block:: shell

     touch services/<cluster name>/rules/<db>.<collection>.json

  The configuration file should have the following general form:

  .. code-block:: json

     {
       "database": "",
       "collection": "",
       "roles": [],
       "filters": [],
       "schema": {}
     }

  Set the ``database`` and ``collection`` values to the database and collection
  the role applies to.

  .. note::

     This guide focuses on creating ``roles`` for the collection. Check
     out the other configuration guides to learn how to :doc:`create
     filters </mongodb/filter-incoming-queries>` and :doc:`enforce
     document schemas </mongodb/enforce-a-document-schema>`.

title: Add One or More Roles
ref: add-one-or-more-roles
content: |
  Add a document to the ``roles`` array for each role that you want to
  configure. Role documents have the following form:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     {
       "name": "<Role Name>",
       "apply_when": <JSON Expression>,
       "insert": <boolean>,
       "delete": <boolean>,
       "read": <boolean>,
       "write": <boolean>,
       "fields": {
         "<Field Name>": {
           "read": <boolean>,
           "write": <boolean>
         },
         ...
       },
       "additional_fields": {
         "read": <boolean>,
         "write": <boolean>
       }
     }

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 15 40

     * - Field
       - Description

     * - ``name``
       - Required. The name of the role. Limited to 100 characters or
         fewer.

     * - ``apply_when``
       - Required. A :doc:`JSON expression </services/json-expressions>` that
         determines when this role applies to a given document.

     * - ``insert``
       - Optional. Default: ``false``. A boolean that, if ``true``,
         indicates that the role has permission to insert a new
         document. This document-level permission does not override any
         field-level permissions configured in ``fields``, i.e. the role
         must have permission to write to all inserted fields in
         addition to insert permission.

     * - ``delete``
       - Optional. Default: ``false``. A boolean that, if ``true``,
         indicates that the role has permission to delete a new
         document.

     * - ``read``
       - Optional. Default: ``false``. A boolean that, if ``true``,
         indicates that the role has permission to read *all* fields in
         a document. This document-level read permission overrides any
         field-level permissions configured in ``fields``.

     * - ``write``
       - Optional. Default: ``false``. A boolean that, if ``true``,
         indicates that the role has permission to write to *all* fields
         in a document. Further, write permissions require matching read
         permissions, so if this is ``true``, then ``read`` is also
         ``true``. These document-level read and write permissions
         override any field-level permissions configured in ``fields``.

     * - ``fields``
       - Required. A document where each field matches the name of a
         field in a collection document. The value of each field is a
         document that specifies read and write permissions for the
         field.

         .. example::

            .. code-block:: javascript

               "fields": {
                 "id": {
                    "read": true,
                    "write": false
                 },
               }

     * - ``additional_fields``
       - Optional. Default: ``{ "read": false, "write": false }``. A
         document that specifies the role's default read and write
         permissions for any fields that are not explicitly defined.

         .. code-block:: javascript

            "additional_fields": {
                 "read": true,
                 "write": false
            }

title: Import Your Application Directory
ref: import-your-application-directory
content: |
  Once you've added your role configurations to the collection rule
  configuration file, all that's left is to import the rule.

  Ensure that the rule configuration file is saved then navigate to the
  root of the exported application directory. Log in to MongoDB Atlas
  with {+cli-bin+}:

  .. code-block:: shell

     realm-cli login --api-key="<my api key>" --private-api-key="<my private api key>"

  Once you're logged in, import the directory:

  .. code-block:: shell

     realm-cli import

  Once the import completes, Realm will immediately begin using the
  roles you defined for all incoming queries on the collection.

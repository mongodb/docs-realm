  When creating or updating documents, all writes must happen in a 
  :ref:`transaction <dotnet-write-transactions>`. 

  The following code shows two methods for creating a new Realm object. In the 
  first example, we create the object first, and then add it to the realm within 
  a :dotnet-sdk:`WriteAsync() <reference/Realms.Realm.html#Realms_Realm_WriteAsync_System_Action_System_Threading_CancellationToken_>`
  method. In the second example, we create the document within the ``WriteAsync`` 
  block, which returns a realm object we can further work with.

  Upserting a document is the same as creating a new one, except you set the 
  optional ``update`` parameter to ``true``. In this example, we create a new 
  ``Person`` object with a unique ``Id``. We then try to insert a person with the 
  same id. Because we have set the ``update`` parameter to ``true``, the existing 
  record is updated.

You can query and iterate through a :ref:`RealmDictionary <sdks-dictionary-property-types>` 
property as you would a  
`Kotlin Map <https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/-map/#kotlin.collections.Map>`__.

In the following example, we query a ``RealmDictionary`` property called 
``favoritePondsByForest``, which maps a ``String`` key (forest) to a 
``String`` value (pond).

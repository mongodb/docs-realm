In the files where you use the SDK, add the appropriate imports for the APIs
you're using.

The Kotlin library APIs are divided into two modules:

- :kotlin-sdk:`Realm Kotlin SDK <index.html>`: APIs that deal with device
  database functionality, such as modeling data, reacting to changes, and type
  serializers.
- :kotlin-sync-sdk:`Realm Kotlin SDK - Sync <index.html>`: APIs that deal with
  connecting to MongoDB for Device Sync, user authentication, calling an
  Atlas Function, and accessing MongoDB Atlas.

Refer to the API documentation for each respective module for API details.

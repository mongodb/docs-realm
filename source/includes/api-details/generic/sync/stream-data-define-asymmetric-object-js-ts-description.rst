Asymmetric objects sync data unidirectionally. Define an asymmetric object
by setting ``asymmetric`` to ``true`` in your :js-sdk:`object model 
<types/BaseObjectSchema.html>`.

For more information on how to define an asymmetric object, refer to 
:ref:`Define an Asymmetric Object <sdks-asymmetric-objects>`.

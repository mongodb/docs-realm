You can create a primary key with any of the following types (or their nullable counterparts):

- ``ObjectId``
- ``UUID``
- ``string``
- ``char``
- ``byte``
- ``short``
- ``int``
- ``long``

To designate a property as the object's primary key, use the
:dotnet-sdk:`Primary Key <reference/Realms.PrimaryKeyAttribute.html>` attribute.

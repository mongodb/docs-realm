You can use the built-in language features to assign a default value to a property.
In C#, you can assign a default value on primitives in the property declaration.

.. note:: Default Values and Nullability

   While default values ensure that a newly created object cannot contain
   a value of ``null`` (unless you specify a default value of ``null``),
   they do not impact the nullability of a property. For details about
   nullability, refer to :ref:`sdks-optional-property-types`.

To define an asymmetric object, your objects must implement the 
:dotnet-sdk:`IAsymmetricObject <reference/Realms.IAsymmetricObject.html>`
interface or derive from the 
:dotnet-sdk:`AsymmetricObject <reference/Realms.AsymmetricObject.html>` class.

For more information on how to define an asymmetric object, refer to

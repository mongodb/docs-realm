To check the connection state, you can read the  
:dotnet-sdk:`Session instance's ConnectionState
<reference/Realms.Sync.Session.html#Realms_Sync_Session_ConnectionState>`
property. Its value is a :dotnet-sdk:`ConnectionState enum 
<reference/Realms.Sync.ConnectionState.html>` that reflects the current state
of the sync session's connection.

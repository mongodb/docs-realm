To check the Sync state, you can read the  
:dotnet-sdk:`Session instance's State
<reference/Realms.Sync.Session.html#Realms_Sync_Session_State>`
property. Its value is a :dotnet-sdk:`ConnectionState enum 
<reference/Realms.Sync.SessionState.html>` that reflects the current state
of the Sync session's communication with the server.

The SDK provides two specialized non-persistable data types to define shapes:

- :dotnet-sdk:`GeoPoint <reference/Realms.GeoPoint.html>`: A
  struct that represents the coordinates of a point formed by a pair of
  doubles consisting of these values:
  
  - Latitude: ranges between -90 and 90 degrees, inclusive.
  - Longitude: ranges between -180 and 180 degrees, inclusive.
- :dotnet-sdk:`Distance <reference/Realms.Distance.html>`: A helper
  struct to represent and convert a distance.

Once you have enabled Device Sync and authenticated a user, you can 
open a synced database. Use a ``FlexibleSyncConfiguration`` object to define
the specifics of how your application synchronizes data with App Services.
Then, add a Sync subscription that determines what data the user can read and
write.

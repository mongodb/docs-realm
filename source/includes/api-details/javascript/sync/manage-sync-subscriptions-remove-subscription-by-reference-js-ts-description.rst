If you have a reference to a subscription, you can remove that subscription. To
do so, execute a transaction on the subscriptions set. Within the transaction,
pass the reference variable to the :js-sdk:`removeSubscription
<classes/MutableSubscriptionSet.html#removeSubscription>` method on the
``MutableSubscriptionSet``.

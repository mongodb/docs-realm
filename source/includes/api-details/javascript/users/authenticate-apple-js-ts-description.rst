You can use the :apple:`official Sign in with Apple JS SDK
<documentation/sign_in_with_apple/sign_in_with_apple_js>` to handle the user
authentication and redirect flow from a client application. Once authenticated,
the Apple JS SDK returns an ID token that you can send to your app and
use to finish logging the user in to your app.

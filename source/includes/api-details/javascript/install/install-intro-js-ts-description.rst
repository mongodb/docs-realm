The Atlas Device SDK for JavaScript enables development of applications using
the JavaScript and TypeScript languages. The JavaScript library is best suited
for writing server-side applications. Your application could be one 
component in a wider stack that also includes iOS and Android apps.

The JavaScript library is not suitable for front-end application development.

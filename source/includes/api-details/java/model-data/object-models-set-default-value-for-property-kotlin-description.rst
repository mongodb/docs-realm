To assign a default value to a field, use the built-in language features.
Assign default values in the field declaration.

.. note:: Default Values and Nullability

   While default values ensure that a newly created object cannot contain
   a value of ``null`` (unless you specify a default value of ``null``),
   they do not impact the nullability of a field. For details about
   nullability, refer to :ref:`sdks-optional-property-types`.

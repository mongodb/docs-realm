You can create objects that contain 
:cpp-sdk:`set <structrealm_1_1managed_3_01std_1_1set_3_01T_01_5_01_4_01_4.html>` 
properties as you would any SDK object, but you can only mutate a set 
property within a write transaction. This means you can only set the value(s) 
of a set property within a write transaction.

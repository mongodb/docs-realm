In C++, the :cpp-sdk:`Results <structrealm_1_1results.html>` type exposes member 
functions to work with results. You may want to check the ``.size()`` of a
results set, or access the object at a specific index.

Additionally, you can iterate through the results, or observe a results
set for changes. For more details about observing the results for changes,
refer to :ref:`sdks-react-to-changes`.

You can read, query, and sort a :cpp-sdk:`list
<structrealm_1_1managed_3_01std_1_1vector_3_01T_01_5_01_4_01_4.html>` similar
to working with a :cpp-sdk:`results
<structrealm_1_1internal_1_1bridge_1_1results.html>` collection. You can also
work with a list as a results set by calling the ``as_results()`` public member
function of the managed list class.

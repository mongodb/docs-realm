Once you have enabled Device Sync and authenticated a user, you can create
a :cpp-sdk:`sync_configuration 
<structrealm_1_1internal_1_1bridge_1_1realm_1_1sync__config.html>` object and 
open the database. You can then add a Sync subscription that determines what
data the database can read and write.

When a user registers or successfully authenticates to your App, Atlas App
Services automatically creates a :cpp-sdk:`user
<structrealm_1_1user.html>` object, which contains a unique
identifier and user state information. You can optionally configure
:ref:`custom user data <sdks-custom-user-data>` if your app needs to store
additional user data. To learn more about the user object that App Services
provides, refer to :ref:`<user-objects>` in the App Services documentation.

Unlike opening a database for non-asymmetric object types, when you open a
database for Data Ingest, you *must* specify the ``asymmetric_object`` types
you want to sync.

.. tip:: Mixed Object and Asymmetric Object Types

   You cannot open a single synced database to manage both regular objects
   and asymmetric objects. You must use different databases to manage these
   different object types.

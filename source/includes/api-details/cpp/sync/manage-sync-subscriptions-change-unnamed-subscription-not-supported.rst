C++ does not provide the ability to change an unnamed subscription. If you know
in advance that your app may need to change subscriptions, :ref:`create the
subscription with a name <sdks-add-named-subscription>`.

Alternately, you can :ref:`remove all subscriptions
<sdks-remove-all-subscriptions>`, and :ref:`create new subscriptions
<sdks-sync-subscriptions-add-subscription>` with the desired query.

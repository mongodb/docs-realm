You can sync data unidirectionally when you declare an object's 
schema as a ``REALM_ASYMMETRIC_SCHEMA``.

For more information on how to define a ``REALM_ASYMMETRIC_SCHEMA``, 
including limitations when linking to other object types, see: 
:ref:`Define an Asymmetric Object <sdks-asymmetric-objects>`.

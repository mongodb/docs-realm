Some developers experience build issues after installing the SDK via
CocoaPods or Carthage. Common causes of these issues include:

- Installation issues:

  - Initial install failed
  - Using an unsupported version of the dependency manager

- Build tool issues:

  - Build tools have stale caches
  - Updating build tool versions

- Making changes to your project setup, such as:

  - Adding a new target 
  - Sharing dependencies across targets

A fix that often clears these issues is to delete derived data 
and clean the Xcode build folder.

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Reset the Cocoapods Integration State

      Run these commands in the terminal, in the root of your project:

      .. code-block::

         pod cache clean Realm
         pod cache clean RealmSwift
         pod deintegrate || rm -rf Pods
         pod install --repo-update --verbose
         # Assumes the default DerivedData location:
         rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData

   .. step:: Clean the Xcode Build Folder

      With your project open in Xcode, go to the Product drop-down menu,
      and select Clean Build Folder.

When a user registers or successfully authenticates to your App, Atlas App
Services automatically creates a :swift-sdk:`User
<Extensions/User.html>` object, which contains a unique
identifier and provider-specific :ref:`user metadata <sdks-user-metadata>`.
You can optionally configure :ref:`custom user data <sdks-custom-user-data>`
if your app needs to store additional user data. To learn more about the 
user object that App Services provides, refer to :ref:`<user-objects>` in the
App Services documentation.

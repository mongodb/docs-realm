To execute a function in Swift, use the :swift-sdk:`functions 
<Structs/Functions.html>` object on the currently logged-in user.

The ``functions`` object has dynamic members corresponding to functions.
In this case, ``functions.concatenate()`` refers to the ``concatenate`` 
function. Pass a ``BSONArray`` of arguments.

You can query :swift-sdk:`LinkingObjects <Structs/LinkingObjects.html>`,
an auto-updating container type, to access zero or more objects that are
linked to its owning model object through a property relationship. You can
query ``LinkingObjects`` with the same APIs and predicates as
:swift-sdk:`List\<Element\> <Classes/List.html>` and
:swift-sdk:`Results\<Element\> <Structs/Results.html>`.

The SDK provides two specialized non-persistable data types to define shapes:

- :swift-sdk:`GeoPoint <Typealiases.html#/s:10RealmSwift8GeoPointa>`: A
  struct that represents the coordinates of a point formed by a pair of
  doubles consisting of these values:
  
  - Latitude: ranges between -90 and 90 degrees, inclusive.
  - Longitude: ranges between -180 and 180 degrees, inclusive.
- :swift-sdk:`Distance <Typealiases.html#/s:10RealmSwift8Distancea>`: A helper
  struct to represent and convert a distance.

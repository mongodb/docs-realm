You can :swift-sdk:`search for a subscription by name 
<Structs/SyncSubscriptionSet.html#/s:10RealmSwift19SyncSubscriptionSetV5first5namedAA0cD0VSgSS_tF>`,
and then update the named subscription.

To change a subscription query, call the ``updateQuery`` method on an existing
query inside a ``subscriptions.update`` block.

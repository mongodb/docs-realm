In a non-synced database, the simplest option to open the database
is to use the default database with no configuration parameter, as shown in
the example below.

You can also specify a :swift-sdk:`Realm.Configuration <Structs/Realm/Configuration.html>` 
parameter to open a database at a specific file URL, in-memory, or with a 
subset of classes.

You can create a primary key with any of the following types:

- String
- Int
- ObjectId
- UUID

To designate a property as an object's primary key, declare the property with
:swift-sdk:`primaryKey: true
<Structs/Persisted.html#/s:10RealmSwift9PersistedVA2A11_PrimaryKey01_A5ValueRpzrlE07primaryE0ACyxGSb_tcfc>`
on the ``@Persisted`` notation.

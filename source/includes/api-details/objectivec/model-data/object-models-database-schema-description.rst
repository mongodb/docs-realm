In Objective-C, you don't have to explicitly specify the database schema when
you configure the database. Swift SDK executables can automatically read and
write any valid SDK object whose model is included in the executable. If you
want to restrict a database to manage only a subset of the SDK models in the
executable, you *can* explicitly pass the models when configuring a database.

For more information, refer to :ref:`sdks-provide-a-subset-of-models-to-a-database`.

The ``RLMResults`` type provides convenience functions to work with query
results. You may want to:

- Check the :objc-sdk:`.count
  <Classes/RLMResults.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMResults(py)count>` of a results set.
- Find the :objc-sdk:`-indexOfObject:
  <Classes/RLMResults.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMResults(im)indexOfObject:>`
  for an object.
- Get the :objc-sdk:`-objectAtIndex:
  <Classes/RLMResults.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMResults(im)objectAtIndex:>`.
- Get the :objc-sdk:`-firstObject
  <Classes/RLMResults.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMResults(im)firstObject>` or
  :objc-sdk:`-lastObject
  <Classes/RLMResults.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMResults(im)lastObject>` in the
  results set.

For the full range of available functions to work with the results set,
refer to the the :objc-sdk:`RLMResults <Classes/RLMResults.html>` API reference.

Additionally, you can observe a results set for changes. For more details
about observing the results for changes, refer to :ref:`sdks-react-to-changes`.

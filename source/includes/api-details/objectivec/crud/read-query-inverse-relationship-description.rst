You can query :swift-sdk:`RLMLinkingObjects
<Classes.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMLinkingObjects>`, an auto-updating container type,
to access zero or more objects that are linked to its owning model object
through a property relationship. You can query ``RLMLinkingObjects`` with the
same APIs and predicates as
:swift-sdk:`RLMArray\<Element\> <Classes/RLMArray.html>` and
:swift-sdk:`RLMResults\<Element\> <Classes/RLMResults.html>`.

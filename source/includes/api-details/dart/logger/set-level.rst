In the Flutter SDK, you can set the level of detail reported on a 
per-isolate basis. To configure the log level, set the static property 
:flutter-sdk:`Realm.logger.level <realm/Realm/logger.html>`
to one of the constants provided by 
:flutter-sdk:`RealmLogLevel <realm/RealmLogLevel-class.html#constants>`.

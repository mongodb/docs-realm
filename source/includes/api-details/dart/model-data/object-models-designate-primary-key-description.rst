You can create a primary key with any of the following types (or their nullable counterparts):

- ``String``
- ``int``
- ``ObjectId``
- ``Uuid``

To designate a property as the object's primary key, use the `PrimaryKey 
<https://pub.dev/documentation/realm_common/latest/realm_common/PrimaryKey-class.html>`__
annotation.

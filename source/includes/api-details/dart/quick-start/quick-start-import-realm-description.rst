.. tip:: Standalone Dart or Flutter Project?

   This quick start contains information for using the SDK with a standalone
   Dart project. The package that you import, and the way you create object
   models, differs if you are using the SDK in a Flutter project. For a quick
   start using Flutter, refer to :ref:`frameworks-flutter-quick-start`.

Import the package into any files where you use it.

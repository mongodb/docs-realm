Dart does not provide the ability to change an unnamed subscription. If you
know in advance that your app may need to change subscriptions, :ref:`create
the subscription with a name <sdks-add-named-subscription>`.

Alternately, you can :ref:`delete the unnamed subscription
<sdks-remove-subscriptions>`, and :ref:`create a new subscription
<sdks-sync-subscriptions-add-subscription>` with the desired query.

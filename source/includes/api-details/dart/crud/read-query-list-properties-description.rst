Get a ``RealmList`` by property name with
:flutter-sdk:`dynamic.getList() <realm//DynamicRealmObject/getList.html>`.

You can also work with a list as a results set. Call the
:flutter-sdk:`RealmList\<T\>.asResults() <realm/RealmList/asResults.html>`
method to convert the list to a :flutter-sdk:`RealmResults\<T\>
<realm/RealmResults-class.html>`.

The following example demonstrates some basic usage of ``RealmList``.
For more information about all available methods, refer to the
:flutter-sdk:`RealmList reference <realm/RealmList-class.html>` documentation.

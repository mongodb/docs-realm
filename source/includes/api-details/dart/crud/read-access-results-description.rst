In Dart, the ``RealmResults`` type provides convenience properties and
functions to simplify working with query results. You may want to:

- Check whether the results set :flutter-sdk:`.isEmpty
  <realm/RealmResults/isEmpty.html>`.
- Check the :flutter-sdk:`.length <realm/RealmResults/length.html>` of the
  results.
- Get the :flutter-sdk:`.first <realm/RealmResults/first.html>` or
  :flutter-sdk:`.last <realm/RealmResults/last.html>` element in the results.
- Check whether the results set :flutter-sdk:`.contains()
  <realm/RealmResults/contains.html>` an individual element.
- Find the :flutter-sdk:`indexOf() <realm/RealmResults/indexOf.html>` an
  element.
- Get the :flutter-sdk:`elementAt() <realm/RealmResults/elementAt.html>`
  an index.

For the full range of available properties and functions to work with the
results set, refer to the the :flutter-sdk:`RealmResults
<realm/RealmResults-class.html>` API reference.

Additionally, you can iterate through the results, or observe a results
set for changes. For more details about observing the results for changes,
refer to :ref:`sdks-react-to-changes`.

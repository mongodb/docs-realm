title: Set Up a New Webhook
ref: set-up-a-new-webhook
content: |
  Incoming webhooks are scoped to individual :doc:`services
  </services>`. You can create and manage a webhook from its associated
  service page in the Realm UI.

  To create an incoming webhook:

  1. Click :guilabel:`Services` in the left-hand navigation.

  2. Click the Service for which you want to add an incoming webhook.

  3. Select the :guilabel:`Incoming Webhooks` tab for the service.

  4. Click :guilabel:`Add Incoming Webhook`. Realm will redirect you to
     the :guilabel:`Settings` screen for the new webhook.

title: Name the New Webhook
ref: name-the-new-webhook
content: |
  Enter a unique, identifying name for the webhook in the
  :guilabel:`Webhook Name` field. This name must be distinct from any
  other webhooks that you've created for the service.

title: Configure User Authentication
ref: configure-user-authentication
content: |
  Functions in Realm, including webhooks, always execute in
  the context of a specific application user or as the
  :ref:`system user <system-user>`, which bypasses rules. To
  configure the webhook's execution user, specify the type
  of authentication that Realm should use for the webhook.

  .. list-table::
     :widths: 20 80
     :header-rows: 1
     
     * - Authentication Type
       - Description
     
     * - Application Authentication
       - This type of authentication configures a webhook to run in the
         context of an existing application user specified by each
         incoming request. Incoming requests must include the user's
         :doc:`authentication provider </authentication/providers>`
         credentials in either the request body or the request headers.

         The following examples demonstrate the field names and values
         for each supported authentication provider:

         .. tabs-realm-auth-providers::
            
            .. tab::
               :tabid: local-userpass
               
               .. code-block:: json
                  
                  {
                    "email": "<User's Email Address>",
                    "password": "<User's Password>"
                  }
            
            .. tab::
               :tabid: api-key
               
               .. code-block:: json
                     
                  {
                    "api-key": "<User's API Key>"
                  }
            
            .. tab::
               :tabid: custom-token
               
               .. code-block:: json
                     
                  {
                    "jwtTokenString": "<User's JWT Token>"
                  }
     
         .. admonition:: Do Not Use Both Headers and Body Fields
            :class: important
            
            If a request includes credentials in both the request
            headers and the request body, then Realm throws an error
            and does not execute the function.
     
     * - System
       - This type of authentication configures a webhook to run as the
         :ref:`system user <system-user>`, which has full
         access to MongoDB CRUD and Aggregation APIs and is
         not affected by any rules, roles, or permissions.
     
     * - User ID
       - This type of authentication configures a webhook to always run
         as a specific application user.
     
     * - Script
       - This type of authentication configures a webhook to run as a
         specific application user determined by the result of a
         custom :doc:`function </functions>` that you define. The
         function must return a specific user's ``id`` string or can
         specify a system user by returning ``{ "runAsSystemUser": true
         }``.

title: Select the Webhook's HTTP Method
ref: select-the-webhooks-http-method
content: |
  You can require that incoming requests use a specific :mdn:`HTTP
  method <Web/HTTP/Methods>` or you can accept all HTTP methods and
  handle each one individually in the webhook function by inspecting the
  ``httpMethod`` property on the :ref:`context.request
  <context-request>` object, as in the following example function:

  .. include:: /services/examples/webhook-http-method-handler.rst

  .. cssclass:: bordered-figure
  .. figure:: /images/webhook-http-method-dropdown.png
---
title: Configure the Webhook Response
ref: configure-the-webhook-response
content: |
  You can send a configurable :mdn:`HTTP Response
  <Web/HTTP/Messages#HTTP_Responses>` to external services that call the
  webhook.

  If you enable :guilabel:`Respond With Result`, the webhook will
  respond to incoming requests with a basic :mdn:`HTTP 200
  <Web/HTTP/Status/200>` response that includes the webhook function
  return value as its ``body`` field. You can configure a custom HTTP
  response from within the webhook function using the ``response``
  object that Realm automatically passes as the second argument.

title: Specify an Authorization Expression
ref: specify-an-authorization-expression
content: |
  You can dynamically authorize requests based on the contents of each
  request by defining a :guilabel:`Can Evaluate` :doc:`JSON expression
  </services/json-expressions>`. Realm evaluates the expression for
  every incoming request that the webhook receives. If you do not
  specify an expression then Realm automatically authorizes all
  authenticated incoming requests.
  
  The expression can expand standard :doc:`expression variables
  </services/expression-variables>`, including the
  :json-expansion:`%%request` expansion.

title: Specify the Request Validation Method
ref: specify-the-request-validation-method
content: |
  To validate that a webhook request was sent from a trusted source,
  some external services require that incoming requests incorporate a
  secret string in one of several prescribed manners. Other services,
  like the :doc:`HTTP service </services/http>`, allow you to optionally
  require request validation.

  If your webhook requires request validation:

  1. Select the :ref:`request validation method <webhook-request-validation>`.

  2. Enter a :guilabel:`Secret` string to use in the request validation
     process.

title: Write the Webhook Function
ref: write-the-webhook-function
content: |
  Once you've configured the webhook, all that's left is to write the
  function that executes when someone calls the webhook. Realm
  automatically passes two objects as the webhook function's arguments:

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 10 30

     * - Argument
       - Description

     * - ``payload``
       - An EJSON representation of the incoming request payload. The
         contents of the payload document will vary depending on the
         service and event that caused a webhook to fire. For a
         description of the ``payload`` object for a specific service,
         see that service's reference page.

     * - ``response``
       - An :ref:`HTTP response object <webhook-response-object>` that
         configures Realm's response to the client that called the
         webhook. The object has methods that allow you to set the
         response's headers, body, and status code. Calling any of these
         methods overrides the default response behavior.

  You can use the following webhook function as a base for your own webhook:

  .. code-block:: javascript
     :emphasize-lines: 3, 10-11, 14-15

     exports = async function(payload, response) {
       // Convert the webhook body from BSON to an EJSON object
       const body = EJSON.parse(payload.body.text());

       // Execute application logic, such as working with MongoDB
       if(body.someField) {
         const mdb = context.services.get('mongodb-atlas');
         const requests = mdb.db("demo").collection("requests")
         const { insertedId } = await requests.insertOne({ someField: body.someField });
         // Respond with an affirmative result
         response.setStatusCode(200)
         response.setBody(`Successfully saved "someField" with _id: ${insertedId}.`);
       } else {
         // Respond with a malformed request error
         response.setStatusCode(400)
         response.setBody(`Could not find "someField" in the webhook request body.`);
       }
       // This return value does nothing because we already modified the response object.
       // If you do not modify the response object and you enable *Respond with Result*,
       // Realm will include this return value as the response body.
       return { msg: "finished!" };
     }

  .. note::

     If you want to debug a webhook function response from the function
     editor, you must manually provide the HTTP response object when you
     run the function.

     .. code-block:: javascript

        exports(
          { body: "This document is the webhook payload" },
          new HTTPResponse()
        )
---
title: Save the Webhook
ref: save-the-webhook
content: |
  You must save changes to your webhook before they take effect. To do
  so, click :guilabel:`Save` from either the :guilabel:`Settings` screen
  or the :guilabel:`Function Editor`.

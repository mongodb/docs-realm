  You can define the document schema for a collection from the MongoDB
  rules page in the {+ui+}. To get to the rules page, click
  :guilabel:`Rules` beneath :guilabel:`MongoDB Clusters` in the
  left-hand navigation.
  On the :guilabel:`Rules` page, select the collection for which you
  want to define the schema from the menu then click the
  :guilabel:`Schema` tab.

title: Generate a Schema
ref: generate-a-schema
level: 4
content: |
  {+service-short+} can sample a subset of documents in the collection and
  automatically generate a schema for you based on the sample.

  To automatically generate a schema, click the :guilabel:`Regenerate
  Schema` button. By default, {+service-short+} randomly samples up to 1,000
  documents from all documents in the collection, but you can configure
  the number of documents to sample and specify a query to focus the
  schema on specific documents.
  To change the number of documents in the sample, specify your desired
  number in the :guilabel:`Generate Schema` input box. You may sample up
  a maximum of ``50,000`` documents. The process may take up to a minute
  depending on the number and contents of the sampled documents.

  To modify which documents and fields to include in the sample, click
  :guilabel:`Advanced (Optional)` and specify a standard MongoDB query,
  projection, and/or sort filter in the :guilabel:`Define a Query` input
  boxes. Use the query and sort filters to sample a specific subset of
  documents and use the projection filter to sample a specific subset of
  fields from each document.

  When you're satisfied with your sample configuration, click
  :guilabel:`Generate Schema`. {+service-short+} will immediately begin to sample
  documents and generate a collection schema based on your
  configuration.

title: Add Field-Level Schema Definitions
ref: add-field-level-schema-definitions
level: 4
content: |
  The schema for each collection is a single `JSON Schema
  <https://json-schema.org/>`_ document. The root-level type of each
  collection schema is a BSON ``object`` schema that represents a
  document in the collection. You can define additional schemas for
  document fields within the root schema's ``properties`` field.

  .. note::
     The fields available in a JSON schema object depends on the type of
     value that the schema defines. See the :doc:`document schema types
     </mongodb/document-schemas>` reference page for details on all of the
     available schema types.

  .. example::
     A group is using {+service-short+} to run a voting app where users aged 13 or
     older can submit a ranked list of their favorite colors. They store
     the votes in a MongoDB collection named ``votes`` where each
     document represents a single person's vote. Each vote must include
     the person's name, age, and an array of their favorite colors. Each
     color has a ``rank``, ``name``, and a ``hexCode``.
     The following is a typical document in the ``votes`` collection:

     .. code-block:: json

        {
          "name": "Jane Doe",
          "age": 42,
          "favoriteColors": [
            { "rank": 1, "name": "RebeccaPurple", "hexCode": "#663399" },
            { "rank": 2, "name": "DodgerBlue", "hexCode": "#1E90FF" },
            { "rank": 3, "name": "SeaGreen", "hexCode": "#2E8B57" },
          ]
        }

     The group can use the following schema to guarantee that the listed
     constraints are satisfied for each document in the ``votes``
     collection:

     .. code-block:: json

        {
          "bsonType": "object",
          "required": ["name", "age", "favoriteColors"],
          "properties": {
            "name": {
              "bsonType": "string"
            },
            "age": {
              "bsonType": "int",
              "minimum": 13,
              "exclusiveMinimum": false
            },
            "favoriteColors": {
              "bsonType": "array",
              "uniqueItems": true,
              "items": {
                "bsonType": "object",
                "properties": {
                  "rank": { "bsonType": "int" },
                  "name": { "bsonType": "string" },
                  "hexCode": {
                    "bsonType": "string",
                    "pattern": "^#([A-Fa-f0-9]{6}|[A-Fa-f0-9]{3})$"
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }

title: Add Change Validation Expressions
ref: add-change-validation-expressions
level: 4
content: |
  In addition to configuring the content of each field, you can validate
  changes to documents by defining a validation :doc:`expression
  </services/json-expressions>` in the ``validate`` field of a schema.
  Validation expressions can use the :json-expansion:`%%prev` and
  :json-expansion:`%%prevRoot` expansions to access a field or
  document's values *before* the insert or update operation occurred.

  .. example::

     Consider a collection where the document's ``owner_id`` field
     represents the owner of each document. The business rules for this
     collection specify that once a document has an owner, the value of
     ``owner_id`` should never change. We can enforce this constraint
     with the following validation expression that ensures that update
     operations do not change the ``owner_id`` value unless its to
     assign an owner where there was none previously:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        "owner_id": {
          "validate": {
            "%or": [
              { "%%prev": { "%exists": false } },
              { "%%prev": "%%this" }
            ]
          }
        }
        
     We could also use the :json-expansion:`%%prevRoot` expansion to
     create the following equivalent validation expression:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        "owner_id": {
          "validate": {
            "%or": [
              { "%%prevRoot.owner_id": { "%exists": false } },
              { "%%prevRoot.owner_id": "%%root.owner_id" }
            ]
          }
        }
---
title: Save the Schema
ref: save-the-schema
level: 4
content: |
  After you have configured the schema, click :guilabel:`Save`. After
  saving, {+service-short+} immediately begins enforcing the schema for all future
  queries.

  .. note::

     Existing documents that do not match the schema are not
     automatically updated or validated, so future changes to these
     documents may cause schema validation failures.
---
title: Validate Documents Against the Schema
ref: validate-documents-against-the-schema
level: 4
content: |
  Once you have saved the collection schema, you can validate that
  existing documents in the collection conform to the schema.
  {+service-short+} uses the same approach to sample documents for validation as it
  does for automatic schema generation.

  To validate a collection against its current schema, click the
  :guilabel:`Validate` tab and configure the document sample. Just like
  with schema generation, you can specify the number of documents to
  sample as well as a MongoDB query filter, and/or sort document to
  modify which documents and fields {+service-short+} includes in the sample.

  Once you have configured the sample, click the :guilabel:`Run
  Validation` button. {+service-short+} will sample documents from the collection
  and validate each document against the schema. Once the validation is
  complete, {+service-short+} shows a table that lists any validation errors.

  .. cssclass:: bordered-figure
  .. figure:: /images/schema-validation-sample-config.png
     :alt: The configuration screen for schema validation in the {+ui+}
     :lightbox:

  Each row of the table represents a specific type of validation error
  for a particular field and indicates the number of documents that failed
  to validate in that way.

  .. cssclass:: bordered-figure
  .. figure:: /images/schema-validation-errors-table.png
     :alt: The table that displays schema validation errors in the {+ui+}
     :lightbox:

  To see the specific documents that caused a given validation error,
  click the :guilabel:`Copy Query` button for that error. This copies a
  standard MongoDB query that you can use to find the documents in the
  ``mongo`` shell, MongoDB compass, or the Atlas Data Explorer. You can
  also click the :guilabel:`Failed Documents` button to download the raw
  validation data.

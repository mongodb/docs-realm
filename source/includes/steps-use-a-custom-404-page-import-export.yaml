title: Create a Custom 404 Page HTML File
ref: upload-the-404-page-html-file
content: |
  You can use any valid HTML file for your application's 404 page.
  Consider incorporating the following elements:

  - A short message indicating the error, e.g. "This page does not
    exist."
  - Alternative links or options for the user to continue navigating.

title: Export Your Realm Application
ref: export-your-application
content: |
  To configure a custom 404 page with :doc:`realm-cli
  </deploy/realm-cli-reference>` you need to export an
  :ref:`application directory <application-directory>`.

  You can :doc:`export </deploy/export-realm-app>` your application from the
  :guilabel:`Import/Export App` tab of the :guilabel:`Deploy` page in the
  {+ui+}, or by running the following command from an authenticated instance of
  :doc:`realm-cli </deploy/realm-cli-reference>`:

  .. code-block:: shell

     realm-cli export --app-id=<App ID>

title: Host the HTML File in Realm
ref: host-the-html-file-in-realm
content: |
  Once you've created the custom HTML file, you need to :doc:`host it in
  {+service-short+} </hosting/upload-content-to-realm>`.

  If you aren't already hosting the HTML file in {+service-short+}, add it to the
  :guilabel:`/hosting` subdirectory of the exported directory.
---
title: Specify the 404 Page in the Application Configuration
ref: specify-the-404-page-in-the-application-configuration
content: |
  In :ref:`config.json <appschema-realm-config>`, set the value of
  ``hosting.default_error_path`` to the :ref:`resource path
  <hosting-resource-path>` of the HTML file then save the configuration
  file.

  .. code-block:: json

     "hosting": {
       "enabled": true,
       "default_error_path": "/pages/custom_404.html"
     }
---
title: Import the Updated Application Directory
ref: import-the-updated-application-directory
content: |
  Once you have specified the custom 404 page path in ``config.json``,
  you can import the directory into your application. If you added the
  custom HTML file to ``/hosting``, make sure to use the
  ``--include-hosting`` flag.

  .. code-block:: shell

     realm-cli import --include-hosting

  After you have successfully imported the changes, {+backend+} will begin
  serving your custom HTML instead of the default 404 page.

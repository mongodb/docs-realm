  To configure a custom 404 page with {+cli-bin+}, you need a local copy of your
  application's configuration files.
  
  To pull a local copy of the latest version of your app, run the following:
  
  .. code-block:: bash
     
     realm-cli pull --remote="<Your App ID>"
  
  .. tip::
     
     You can also download a copy of your application's configuration files from
     the :guilabel:`Deploy > Import/Export App` screen in the {+ui+}.

ref: create-a-custom-404-page-html-file
content: |
  You can use any valid HTML file for your application's 404 page. Consider
  incorporating the following elements:

  - A short message indicating the error, e.g. "This page does not
    exist."
  - Alternative links or options for the user to continue navigating.

ref: host-the-html-file-in-realm
content: |
  Once you've created the custom HTML file, you need to :doc:`host it in
  {+service-short+} </hosting/upload-content-to-realm>`.

  If you aren't already hosting the HTML file in {+service-short+}, add it to
  the ``hosting/files/`` directory.

title: Specify the 404 Page in the Application Configuration
ref: specify-the-404-page-in-the-application-configuration
content: |
  In ``hosting/config.json``, set ``default_error_path`` to the :ref:`resource
  path <hosting-resource-path>` of the 404 page HTML file then save the
  configuration file.

  .. code-block:: json

     "hosting": {
       "enabled": true,
       "default_error_path": "/pages/custom_404.html"
     }

title: Deploy the Updated Hosting Configuration
ref: deploy-the-updated-hosting-configuration
content: |
  Once you've updated ``hosting/config.json`` you can push the updated config to
  your remote app. If you also added the 404 page, make sure to use the
  ``--include-hosting`` flag. {+cli+} immediately starts to serve your custom
  404 page on push.
  
  .. code-block:: bash
     
     realm-cli push --remote="<Your App ID>" --include-hosting

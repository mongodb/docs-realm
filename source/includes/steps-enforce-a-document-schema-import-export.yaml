title: Export Your Realm Application
ref: export-your-application
content: |
  To enforce a document schema with :doc:`realm-cli
  </deploy/realm-cli-reference>` you need to export an
  :ref:`application directory <application-directory>` for your
  application.
  You can :doc:`export </deploy/export-realm-app>` your application
  from the :guilabel:`Export` tab of the :guilabel:`Settings` page in
  the {+ui+}, or by running the following command from an
  authenticated instance of :doc:`realm-cli
  </deploy/realm-cli-reference>`:

  .. code-block:: shell

     realm-cli export --app-id=<App ID>

title: Add a Rule Configuration File
ref: add-a-rule-configuration-file
content: |
  The ``rules`` subdirectory of the :doc:`linked cluster
  </mongodb/link-a-cluster>`'s service directory configures the rules for
  a MongoDB collection. The rules configuration file is a JSON file with
  the same name as the collection namespace. For example, the file
  ``/services/mongodb-atlas/rules/app.users.json`` defines the rules for
  the collection ``app.users`` in the ``mongodb-atlas`` cluster. If you
  have not configured rules for the collection, add a configuration file
  for it to the ``rules`` directory:

  .. code-block:: shell

     touch services/<cluster name>/rules/<db>.<collection>.json

  The configuration file should have the following general form:

  .. code-block:: json

     {
       "roles": [],
       "filters": [],
       "schema": {}
     }

  .. note::

     This guide focuses on creating a ``schema`` for the collection.
     Check out the other configuration guides to learn how to
     :doc:`define roles and permissions
     </mongodb/define-roles-and-permissions>` and :doc:`create filters
     </mongodb/filter-incoming-queries>`.

title: Add a Schema Document
ref: add-a-schema-document
content: |
  Add an :ref:`object schema <schema-type-objects>` document to the
  ``schema`` field that. You can use additional :doc:`schema types
  </mongodb/document-schemas>` to configure specific fields within the
  ``properties`` array. At a minimum, the ``schema`` should resemble the
  following:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     {
       "bsonType": "object",
       "properties": {
         "<Field Name>": <Schema Document>,
         ...
       }
     }

  In addition to configuring the content of each field, you can validate
  changes to documents by defining a validation :doc:`expression
  </services/json-expressions>` in the ``validate`` field of a schema.
  Validation expressions can use the :json-expansion:`%%prev` and
  :json-expansion:`%%prevRoot` expansions to access a field or
  document's values *before* the insert or update operation occurred.

  .. example::

     Consider a collection where the document's ``owner_id`` field
     represents the owner of each document. The business rules for this
     collection specify that once a document has an owner, the value of
     ``owner_id`` should never change. We can enforce this constraint
     with the following validation expression that ensures that update
     operations do not change the ``owner_id`` value unless its to
     assign an owner where there was none previously:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        "owner_id": {
          "validate": {
            "%or": [
              { "%%prev": { "%exists": false } },
              { "%%prev": "%%this" }
            ]
          }
        }

     We could also use the :json-expansion:`%%prevRoot` expansion to
     create the following equivalent validation expression:

     .. code-block:: javascript

        "owner_id": {
          "validate": {
            "%or": [
              { "%%prevRoot.owner_id": { "%exists": false } },
              { "%%prevRoot.owner_id": "%%root.owner_id" }
            ]
          }
        }

title: Import Your Application Directory
ref: import-your-application-directory
content: |
  Once you've added the schema to the collection rule configuration
  file, all that's left is to import the rule.
  Save the rule configuration file then navigate to the
  root of the exported application directory. Log in to MongoDB Atlas
  with {+cli-bin+}:

  .. code-block:: shell

     realm-cli login --api-key="<my api key>" --private-api-key="<my private api key>"

  After logging in, import the directory:

  .. code-block:: shell

     realm-cli import
     
  Once the import completes, {+service-short+} will immediately begin evaluating
  the results of all insert and update operations on the collection
  against the schema to ensure that they conform to your specification.

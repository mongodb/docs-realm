        .. note::

           For iOS client applications, you need to create both a Web
           OAuth Client ID and an iOS OAuth Client ID. The former is
           used by {+service-short+}, while the latter will be used by the app
           itself.
           
           Refer to the :guilabel:`Web` tab of this section for
           instructions on creating the web application Client ID for
           {+service-short+}.

  Follow Google's support guide on `Setting up OAuth 2.0
  <https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en>`_ for your
  project.

         You will need to create a web application :guilabel:`Client ID`
         and provide several {+service-short+}-related values.

         For :guilabel:`Authorized JavaScript Origins`, enter the
         following URL:

         .. code-block:: none

            https://realm.mongodb.com

         For :guilabel:`Authorized Redirect URIs`, enter the {+service-short+}
         authentication callback URL that corresponds to the
         :doc:`deployment region </admin/deployment-models-and-regions>`
         of your application. The following table lists the callback URL
         for each region:

         Use the following values when configuring your Android
         application :guilabel:`Client ID`:

         .. cssclass:: vcenter-first-col
         .. list-table::

            * - :guilabel:`Application Type`
              - Android

            * - :guilabel:`Name`
              - The name you wish to associate with this :guilabel:`Client ID`.

            * - :guilabel:`Signing-certificate Fingerprint`
              - The SHA-1 fingerprint of your application signing
                certificate. See :google:`Authenticating Your
                Client <android/guides/client-auth>` for instructions
                on generating this value.

         Use the following values when configuring your iOS application
         :guilabel:`Client ID`:

         .. cssclass:: vcenter-first-col
         .. list-table::

            * - :guilabel:`Application Type`
              - iOS

            * - :guilabel:`Name`
              - The name you wish to associate with this :guilabel:`Client ID`.

            * - :guilabel:`Bundle ID`
              - The Bundle ID for your iOS application. You can find
                this value in XCode on the :guilabel:`General` tab for
                the app's primary target.

  To connect your GCP project to {+service-short+} add the OAuth 2.0
  :guilabel:`Client ID` and :guilabel:`Client Secret` you generated in
  the previous step to your authentication provider :ref:`configuration
  <auth-google-configuration>`.

        :tabid: ios
        
        .. note::
           
           Make sure that you add the *web application* credentials
           to the provider configuration. If you add the iOS
           credentials instead, Google authentication will fail.

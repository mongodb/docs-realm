  To flush the CDN cache with :doc:`realm-cli
  </deploy/realm-cli-reference>` you need to export an
  :ref:`application directory <application-directory>` for your
  application.

  You can :doc:`export </deploy/export-realm-app>` your
  application from the :guilabel:`Export` tab of the
  :guilabel:`Settings` page in the {+ui+}, or by running the
  following command from an authenticated instance of :doc:`realm-cli
  </deploy/realm-cli-reference>`:

  .. code-block:: shell

     realm-cli export --app-id=<App ID>
---

  To purge the CDN cache, simply include the ``--reset-cdn-cache`` flag
  when you import the application directory:

  .. code-block:: shell

     realm-cli import --reset-cdn-cache
...

title: Clone the Client App Repository
ref: clone-the-client-app-repository
content: |

  We've already put together a task tracker Android application that has
  most of the code you'll need. You can clone the client application
  repository directly from GitHub:

  .. code-block:: console

     git clone https://github.com/mongodb-university/realm-tutorial-android-kotlin.git

  .. important::
   
     The realm-tutorial-android-kotlin repository contains two branches:
     ``final`` and ``start``. The ``final`` branch is a finished version
     of the app as it should look *after* you complete this tutorial.
     To walk through this tutorial, please check out the ``start``
     branch:

     .. code-block:: console
    
        git checkout start

title: Open the Project in Android Studio
ref: open-the-project-in-android-studio
content: |

  Once the installation is complete, use Android Studio to open the
  project:

  1. Open Android Studio.

  2. In the "Welcome to Android Studio" window, click the
     "Open an existing Android Studio project" option.

  3. In the file navigator opened by Android Studio, navigate to the
     directory where, in the previous step, you cloned the
     ``realm-tutorial-android-kotlin`` repository.

  4. Select the ``realm-tutorial-android-kotlin`` folder.

  5. Click "Open".

  6. Run the project using the ``Run`` button.

  This should run the gradle build automatically and launch a
  (nonfunctional) login screen with the text "Task Tracker" at the top of
  the screen:

  .. image:: /images/task-tracker-login.png

title: Explore the App Structure
ref: explore-the-app-structure
content: |

  In the Android Studio Project view, you can see the source files of the task
  tracker application in the ``app`` folder and its subfolders. The
  relevant files are as follows:

  .. cssclass:: config-table
  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 15 85

     * - File
       - Purpose

     * - TaskTracker
       - A subclass of the Android :android:`Application
         <android/app/Application>` class. Responsible for:

         - initializing the connection to {+service+}

         - creating the Realm ``App`` object used by all other classes
           to communicate with the Realm backend

         - defining a Kotlin extension method called ``TAG()`` used
           in logging methods throughout the app, which dynamically
           fetches class names for logging tags.

     * - LoginActivity
       - View launched whenever a user is not currently logged in.
         Allows users to create email/password accounts in the connected
         MongoDB Realm application and login to existing accounts.

     * - ProjectActivity
       - Displays the list of projects that the currently logged in user
         has access to.

     * - MemberActivity
       - Displays the list of users that have access to a project, and
         allows the owner of that project to edit the list of users.

     * - TaskActivity
       - Displays the list of tasks in a project and allows and project
         member to create new tasks as well as edit and delete existing
         tasks.

     * - Project
       - Model describing in-app projects. Subclass of
         the ``RealmObject`` class, which allows you to store objects of
         this class in a {+realm+}.

     * - ProjectAdapter
       - Adapter that allows the display of a list of projects in an
         Android RecyclerView.

     * - Member
       - Model describing in-app members of a project. Does not extend
         the ``RealmObject`` class, since we will fetch members of a
         project using a Realm Function rather than a Realm Database
         query.

     * - MemberAdapter
       - Adapter that allows the display of a list of members in an
         Android RecyclerView.

     * - Task
       - Model describing in-app tasks that make up the contents of a
         project. Subclass of the ``RealmObject`` class, which allows
         you to store objects of this class in a {+realm+}.

     * - TaskStatus
       - Enum class capturing the various possible states of an in-app
         task. Provides a single place to define the strings that Realm
         stores in Realm Database to persist task status state between
         devices and app runs.

     * - TaskAdapter
       - Adapter that allows the display of a list of tasks in an
         Android RecyclerView.

     * - User
       - Model describing in-app user data, including the list of
         projects to which that user belongs.

  TaskTracker stores files that describe the UI logic for Android
  views in the ``app/java/com/mongodb/tasktracker`` directory. Files
  that describe data models or how those data models relate to the UI
  belong in the ``app/java/com/mongodb/tasktracker/models`` directory.

title: Connect to Your MongoDB Realm App
ref: connect-to-your-mongodb-realm-app
content: |

  Tasktracker uses the Gradle dependency management system to manage the
  Realm Android SDK. The Maven and Ant build systems are not currently
  supported.

  Android Studio projects contain two ``build.gradle`` files by default:

  - a top-level **project** ``build.gradle`` file which defines build
    configurations for all project modules
  - a module-level **app** ``build.gradle`` file which allows you to
    configure build settings for that module (your app) only

  You can find the project ``build.gradle`` at the root of the
  TaskTracker project, and the app ``build.gradle`` in the ``app``
  directory of your project. See the location of these files
  in the directory graphic below:

  .. code-block:: text
     :emphasize-lines: 2, 4

     .
     |-- build.gradle       // project gradle file
     |-- app
     |   |-- build.gradle   // app gradle file
     |   |-- src
     |-- gradle
     |   |-- wrapper
     |-- gradle.properties
     |-- gradlew
     |-- gradlew.bat
     |-- local.properties
     |-- settings.gradle
     |-- Task Tracker.iml

  Open the **app** ``build.gradle`` file, where we'll configure your
  app's connection to {+service+}. In the ``android.buildTypes``
  section, define your App ID, which ``TaskTracker`` uses to
  instantiate a connection to your {+app+} whenever this Android app
  runs:

  .. code-block:: groovy
     :emphasize-lines: 2, 4, 7

     buildTypes {
        def appId = "<your app ID here>"  // Replace with proper Application ID
        debug {
            buildConfigField "String", "MONGODB_REALM_APP_ID", "\"${appId}\""
        }
        release {
            buildConfigField "String", "MONGODB_REALM_APP_ID", "\"${appId}\""
            minifyEnabled false
            signingConfig signingConfigs.debug
        }
     }

  Replace ``<your app ID here>`` with your Realm app ID, which you can
  :ref:`find in the Realm UI <find-your-app-id>`.

title: Enable Authentication
ref: enable-authentication
content: |

  Navigate to ``LoginActivity``, which contains all login and user
  registration logic. The UI for ``LoginActivity`` contains text entry
  fields for email and password entry, as well as buttons to either
  register a user account or login to an existing account. We need to
  implement the logic to handle user login and user account creation.

  You'll find this logic in the ``login()`` method, where a boolean
  value called ``createuser`` controls where the method submits user
  credentials to create a new account or to login to an existing
  account.

  First, let's implement the logic that registers a new user:

  .. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/code/final/LoginActivity.codeblock.create-user.kt
     :language: kotlin

  Now, implement the logic to log in with an existing user. Once
  logged in successfully, call the ``onLoginSuccess()`` method, which
  closes the ``LoginActivity`` and resumes the calling activity
  (typically ``ProjectActivity``):

  .. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/code/final/LoginActivity.codeblock.login-user.kt
     :language: kotlin

  Don't forget to call the ``onLoginFailed()`` method in the event of a
  login or account creation failure with a message describing the error.

---
title: Implement the Projects List
ref: implement-the-projects-list
content: |

  ``ProjectActivity`` displays a list of projects that the current user
  can access. For each user, TaskTracker stores the list of accessible
  projects in the ``User`` object. Tasktracker stores each ``User``
  object in a special :ref:`{+realm+} <partitioning>` with a value of
  the following format: ``user=<user-id>``.
  
  .. note::

    To learn more about how {+service-short+} Object models are used in Android applications, 
    see :doc:`Realm Objects </android/objects>` in our Android client guide. 

  To access the user's list of projects, we need to open a connection to
  that {+realm+} and access the ``User`` object. To get started, open
  the user's {+realm+} in the ``else`` block of the ``onStart()`` method
  of ``ProjectActivity``:

  .. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/code/final/ProjectActivity.codeblock.set-up-user-realm.kt
     :language: kotlin

  Next, we need to query the {+realm+} to get a copy of the ``User``
  object containing the user's list of projects. Because each user
  should only ever be able to access their own user object, this realm
  only contains one object: the custom data belonging to the currently
  logged in user. An :ref:`authentication trigger
  <authentication-triggers>` automatically creates and initializes this
  object when the user creates an account. Add the code that queries for
  the user object:

  .. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/code/final/ProjectActivity.codeblock.user-init-change-listener.kt
     :language: kotlin

  Because it can take a few seconds for the trigger to create this
  object after a login, we should handle the case where the user object
  doesn't yet exist immediately after account creation. To accomplish 
  this, in the event that our query doesn't return a user object, we'll
  watch the {+realm+} for changes and only set up the project's Recycler
  View once the trigger runs:

  .. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/code/final/ProjectActivity.codeblock.fetch-synced-user-safely.kt
     :language: kotlin

  Finally, we need to guarantee that ``ProjectActivity`` always closes
  the user {+realm+} when the app closes or the user logs out. To
  accomplish this, add logic that calls the ``realm.close()`` method
  when ``ProjectActivity`` finishes or stops:

  .. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/code/final/ProjectActivity.codeblock.on-destroy-close-realm.kt
     :language: kotlin

  .. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/code/final/ProjectActivity.codeblock.on-stop-close-realm.kt
     :language: kotlin

---
title: Implement the Tasks List
ref: implement-the-tasks-list
content: |

  Navigate to the ``TaskActivity`` file, where we'll display the list
  of tasks that belong to a particular project. TaskTracker stores the
  list of tasks belonging to each project in a special :ref:`{+realm+}
  <partitioning>` with a value of the following format:
  ``project=<user-id>`` (where ``<user-id>`` is equal to the user ID of
  the user who owns the project). We'll begin by initializing a
  connection to this {+realm+} when the activity starts:

  .. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/code/final/TaskActivity.codeblock.set-up-project-realm.kt
     :language: kotlin

  Next, we'll query the realm for the list of tasks belonging to this
  project. Fortunately the query isn't too complicated: since every task
  within this {+realm+} belongs to this project, there's no need to
  filter the query at all. However, we do want to make sure that tasks
  always appear in the same order on the page, so users don't have to
  hunt through the full list every time they reload this activity. To
  accomplish this, we'll add a ``sort()`` to the Realm Database query
  that organizes the tasks by ``_id``. Once you've queried for the
  list of tasks, pass the ``RealmResult`` to the ``TaskAdapter`` and set
  that adapter as the ``RecyclerView's`` adapter:

  .. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/code/final/TaskActivity.codeblock.fetch-tasks-for-project-sorted-by-id.kt
     :language: kotlin

  ``TaskActivity`` needs to allow users to create a new task in the project. To
  handle this, write logic in the floating action button's
  ``setPositiveButton()`` callback that creates a new task based on the user's
  input in ``inputText`` and adds that task to the {+realm+}:

  .. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/code/final/TaskActivity.codeblock.add-new-task-to-project.kt
     :language: kotlin

  Finally, we need to guarantee that ``TaskActivity`` always closes
  the user {+realm+} when the app closes or the user logs out. To
  accomplish this, add logic that calls the ``realm.close()`` method
  when ``TaskActivity`` finishes or stops:

  .. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/code/final/TaskActivity.codeblock.on-destroy-close-realm.kt
     :language: kotlin

  .. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/code/final/TaskActivity.codeblock.on-stop-close-realm.kt
     :language: kotlin

---
title: Add Logic to Update and Delete Tasks to the TaskAdapter
ref: add-logic-to-update-and-delete-tasks-to-the-taskadapter
content: |

  The ``TaskAdapter`` extends the ``RealmRecyclerViewAdapter`` to
  automatically display ``RealmResults``, as well as synced changes to
  the items in a ``RealmResults`` collection, in a Recycler View. While
  ``RealmRecyclerViewAdapter`` gives you a lot of functionality by
  default, it does **not** define the UI for displaying items in a
  ``RealmResults`` collection or any user interaction with those items.
  Fortunately, ``TaskAdapter`` already includes a layout and most
  boilerplate code for you. You'll just have to implement two methods:
  ``changeStatus``, which updates the status of a task, and
  ``removeAt``, which deletes a task from the {+realm+}.

  We'll begin by implementing the logic for ``changeStatus``, which:

  1. Connects to the project realm using the ``partition`` member variable of the adapter.
  #. Queries the realm for the Task with the specified ``_id`` value.
  #. Sets the ``statusEnum`` property of the Task to the specified status value.

  Don't forget to read and write from the {+realm+} within a transaction!

  .. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/code/final/TaskAdapter.codeblock.change-task-status.kt
     :language: kotlin

  The logic that deletes a task is similar to the logic that updates a
  task, but it removes the task from the {+realm+} instead of updating
  any properties:

  .. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/code/final/TaskAdapter.codeblock.delete-task.kt
     :language: kotlin

---
title: Implement the Manage Team View
ref: implement-the-manage-team-view
content: |

  A user can add and remove team members to their own Project using the
  Manage Team view. Since this logic edits the custom user data objects
  of other users (which the currently logged in user cannot edit), we
  need to call out to our Realm functions we defined earlier, which
  handle edits to other user's custom user data objects securely:

  Navigate to ``MemberActivity``, which defines the view
  that pops up when a user clicks the "options" action on their project
  in ``ProjectActivity``. Just like ``ProjectActivity`` and
  ``ProjectActivity``, ``MemberActivity`` fetches the data for the
  Recycler View in the ``setUpRecyclerView`` method. However, instead of
  querying against a realm, we'll instead use a call to the
  ``getMyTeamMembers`` function. This function returns a list of team
  members as objects of the ``Document`` type, so we'll use Kotlin's
  built-in ``map`` function to transform the objects in the list
  returned by the function from type ``Document`` to type ``Member``,
  which is the type of data that ``MemberAdapter`` expects. You can
  access {+service-short+} Functions through the function manager
  found in your project-global {+service-short+} app:

  .. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/code/final/MemberActivity.codeblock.get-team-members.kt
     :language: kotlin

  Similar to ``TaskActivity``, we'll use the floating action button in
  ``MemberActivity`` to add users to the project. To handle this, write
  logic in the floating action button's ``setPositiveButton()`` callback
  that adds a new user to the project using the ``addTeamMember()``
  {+service-short+} function. Because the team members displayed in this
  view aren't :ref:`live Realm Objects <android-live-object>`, this
  RecyclerView's adapter isn't a subclass of
  ``RealmRecyclerViewAdapter``, and we'll have to manually update our
  local copy of the list of team members to reflect the success of this
  method when we add a team member. To do this, call
  ``setUpRecyclerView()`` to reload the list of team members from the
  backend when the ``addTeamMember()`` {+service-short+} Function
  successfully adds a team member:

  .. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/code/final/MemberActivity.codeblock.add-new-member-to-project.kt
     :language: kotlin

---
title: Handle Team Member Removals in MemberAdapter
ref: handle-team-member-removals-in-memberadapter
content: |

  ``MemberAdapter`` handles the display of a list of team members
  in a RecyclerView. All of the logic to handle this display is already
  provided for you except for the logic that handles removing a team
  member from a project when the user selects "Remove User". To
  implement this logic, we'll have to call the ``removeTeamMember()``
  {+service-short+} Function. When the ``removeTeamMember()``
  {+service-short+} Function successfully removes a team member, we'll
  have to manually remove that team member from the list of team members
  with ``data.removeAt()``. Once you've removed the object from the
  underlying dataset, just call ``notifyItemRemoved()`` with the item's
  position in the dataset and the UI should automatically stop
  displaying the removed team member:

  .. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/code/final/MemberAdapter.codeblock.remove-user-from-project.kt
     :language: kotlin

---
title: Run and Test
ref: run-and-test
content: |

  Once you have completed the code, you can run the app and check
  functionality.

  Click the :guilabel:`Run` button in Android Studio. If the app builds
  successfully, here are some things you can try in the app:

  - Create a user with email *first@example.com*
  - Explore the app, then log out or launch a second instance of the app
    on another virtual device
  - Create another user with email *second@example.com*
  - Navigate to *second@example.com*'s project
  - Add, update, and remove some tasks
  - Navigate back to the list of projects in ``ProjectActivity`` with
    the back button
  - Click the three dots "options" menu on "My Project"
  - Add *first@example.com* to your team by clicking the floating action
    button and entering "*first@example.com*"
  - Log out and log in as *first@example.com*
  - You should see two projects in the projects list, one of them labeled "*second@example.com*'s project"
  - Navigate to *second@example.com*'s project
  - Collaborate by adding, updating, and removing some new tasks

title: Specify the Custom User Data Collection
ref: specify-the-custom-user-data-collection
content: |
  You must store the custom data for your application's users in a
  single collection of a linked MongoDB Atlas cluster. To configure your
  application to read user data from this collection, you need to
  specify the following values:

  - :guilabel:`Cluster Name`: The name of a :doc:`linked MongoDB cluster
    </mongodb>` that contains the custom user data collection.
  
  - :guilabel:`Database Name`: The name of the MongoDB database that
    contains the custom user data collection.
  
  - :guilabel:`Collection Name`: The name of the MongoDB collection that
    contains custom user data.

title: Specify the User ID Field
ref: specify-the-user-id-field
content: |
  Every document in the custom user data collection should have a field
  that contains the user ID of the {+service-short+} user that it describes.
  Specify the name of the field that contains each user's ID in the
  :guilabel:`User ID Field` input.

title: Deploy the Updated Application
ref: deploy-the-updated-application
content: |
  Once you have configured the customer user data collection, you can
  make custom user data available to client applications by deploying
  your application. To deploy a draft application from the {+ui+}:
  
  1. Click :guilabel:`Deploy` in the {+leftnav+}.
  
  2. Find the draft in the deployment history table and then click
     :guilabel:`Review & Deploy Changes`.
  
  3. Review the diff of changes and then click :guilabel:`Deploy`.

  Once the application successfully deploys, {+service-short+} begins to associate
  custom data with users. When a user logs in, {+service-short+} automatically
  queries the custom user data collection for a document where the
  specified :guilabel:`User ID Field` contains the user's ID. If a
  document matches, {+service-short+} exposes the data in the document in the
  ``custom_data`` field of that user's :ref:`user object
  <user-objects>`.

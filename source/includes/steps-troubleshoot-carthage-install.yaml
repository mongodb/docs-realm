   Run these commands in the terminal, in the root of your project:
   
   .. code-block:: bash
      
      rm -rf Carthage
      # Assumes default DerivedData location:
      rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData
      carthage update
   
   .. important:: 
   
      This will update **all** of your Carthage-managed dependencies, not
      just {+backend+}.

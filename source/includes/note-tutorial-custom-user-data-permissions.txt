.. note:: How Do We Know Which Projects a User Can Access?
   
   The :ref:`backend you imported <tutorial-task-tracker-create-realm-app>`
   makes exactly one custom user data object for each user upon signup. The
   backend is set up so that every user has read-only access to their own
   custom user data object. The backend also has functions to add and remove
   access to project, which we will use later when we add the Manage Team
   view.

   By managing the custom user data object entirely on the backend and only
   providing read-only access on the client side, we prevent a malicious
   client from granting themselves arbitrary permissions.

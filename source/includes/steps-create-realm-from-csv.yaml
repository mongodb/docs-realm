  When you create a new {+realm+} file from a CSV, you may get this message:
    
  "Failed to import data: Class name (name-of-file.csv) missing from schema"
  
  If this happens, press :guilabel:`OK`. You'll see that creating a {+realm+}
  from your CSV has created a class definition, but there are no objects
  in your {+realm+}. From here, you can :ref:`Import from a CSV<realm-studio-import-from-a-csv>` 
  to populate your {+realm+} with object that map to the class definition 
  you just created.

  The binaries listed on this page are always the latest version of 
  Realm Studio.

  If you open an older version of a {+realm+} file in a newer Realm Studio 
  version, you may see a prompt to upgrade your {+realm+} file. Once 
  upgraded, you cannot revert to the older file version. You may also 
  need to upgrade your SDK to a version that supports the newer file format. 
   
  If you don't want to upgrade {+client-database+}, download an older 
  version of Realm Studio. You can see a list of all releases at 
  `Realm Studio Releases <https://studio-releases.realm.io/>`_. 
  Click a version number to view a page listing enhancements, fixes,

.. note:: Get Schema from UI if Development Mode Disabled

   If you have enabled {+sync-short+} but turned off Development Mode,
   you can copy and paste the object model definitions that {+backend-short+}
   generated for you from the :guilabel:`SDKs` tab in the {+ui+}.
   You must re-enable Development Mode if you want to make changes to the
   object model definition from client side code.

Realm provides :ref:`many authentication providers <authentication-providers>` 
to log users into your app. Each provider creates a unique user identity. 
Realm lets you merge multiple credentials into one user identity.

However, you can only link credentials that are not already in use by another 
user. Once credentials are used to login a user, they can no longer be merged 
into another user identity. You cannot link multiple email/password credentials
together.

Example
-------

Consider an application that offers :ref:`anonymous login
<anonymous-authentication>`, which allows users to explore the app without 
registering. If a user wants to continue using the application, they can create 
a permanent account by using another authentication provider. Realm 
creates a new ``User`` object. The app can then link the new identity with the 
current user.

.. note:: 

   Depending on how you have configured email/password authentication, there may 
   be additional steps (confirming the email address, for example) before the 
   new account is created and can be linked.

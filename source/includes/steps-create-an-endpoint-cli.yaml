title: Pull the Latest Version of Your App
ref: pull-the-latest-version-of-your-app
content: |
  To define an incoming endpoint with {+cli-bin+}, you need a local copy of your
  application's configuration files.

  To pull a local copy of the latest version of your app, run the following:

  .. code-block:: bash
     
     realm-cli pull --remote="<Your App ID>"

  .. tip::
     
     You can also download a copy of your application's configuration files from
     the :guilabel:`Deploy > Export App` screen in the {+ui+}.

title: Add a Endpoint Configuration Object
ref: add-a-endpoint-configuration-object
content: |
  Create a json object describing the endpoint in the top-level array
  within the :file:`/http_endpoints/config.json` file.

  The configuration object should have the following form:

  .. code-block:: json
     :caption: http_endpoints/config.json
     
     [
       {
          "route": "<Unique Endpoint Route>",
          "http_method": "<HTTP Method>",
          "function_name": "<Function Name>",
          "validation_method": "<Endpoint Validation Method>",
          "secret_name": "<Secret Name>",
          "respond_result": <Boolean>,
          "fetch_custom_user_data": <Boolean>,
          "create_user_on_auth": <Boolean>,
          "disabled": <Boolean>
       }
     ]

  The following table describes each of the fields in the configuration
  object:

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 10 40
 
     * - Field
       - Value
     * - ``route`` (string)
       - The full path and name of the endpoint
     * - ``http_method`` (string)
       - The HTTP method that calling services can use to connect to this 
         endpoint. Valid values are "GET", "POST", "PUT", "PATCH", 
         "DELETE" and "*", the last of which indicates that all methods 
         are accepted.
     * - ``function_name`` (string)
       - The name of the function that {+service-short+} calls when the 
         endpoint receives data.
     * - ``validation_method`` (string)
       - Indicates how the endpoint validates the incoming request. Valid 
         options are:

         - "SECRET_AS_QUERY_PARAM", which requires a secret value in the 
           query parameters
         - "VERIFY_PAYLOAD", which requires an "Endpoint-Signature" field 
           in the header. For example, "Endpoint-Signature::sha256=<hex-encoded-hash>"
         - "NO_VALIDATION", in which {+service-short+} performs no validation
           of the incoming request.
        
         Endpoints that use "SECRET_AS_QUERY_PARAM" or "VERIFY_PAYLOAD" as their
         validation method must also specify a ``secret_name``.
     * - ``secret_name`` (string)
       - The name of the secret used to validate incoming requests. Required
         if "SECRET_AS_QUERY_PARAM" or "VERIFY_PAYLOAD" is used as a validation
         method.
     * - ``respond_result`` (boolean)
       - Specifies if response contains the result of the associated 
         function. If set to **false** and the endpoint completes 
         successfully, the endpoint returns a ``204`` response with 
         no data in the body. 
     * - ``fetch_custom_user_data`` (boolean)
       - If ``true``, {+service-short+} queries the requesting user's 
         :ref:`custom user data <custom-user-data>` and, if it exists, 
         exposes the data as an object on the ``context.user.custom_data`` 
         property.
     * - ``create_user_on_auth`` (boolean)
       - If ``true``, {+service-short+} automatically creates a new user 
         based on the provided user credentials, if they don't match an 
         existing user. The authentication provider that corresponds to 
         the credentials must be enabled at the time of the request to 
         create the new user.
     * - ``disabled`` (boolean)
       - Enables (false) or disables (true) the endpoint.

title: Name the New Endpoint
ref: name-the-new-endpoint
content: |
  Enter a route for the endpoint in the configuration file's ``route``
  field. Each endpoint must use a unique route and HTTP Method
  combination. Begin your route with a leading slash ("/").

  .. code-block:: json
     
     {
       "route": "/example/endpoint"
     }
---
title: Specify the Endpoint's HTTP Method
ref: specify-the-endpoints-http-method
content: |
  You can require that incoming requests use a specific :mdn:`HTTP
  method <Web/HTTP/Methods>` or you can accept all HTTP methods and
  handle each one individually in the endpoint function by inspecting the
  ``httpMethod`` property on the :ref:`context.request
  <context-request>` object, as in the following example function:

  .. include:: /services/examples/endpoint-http-method-handler.rst

  To specify a endpoint method, set the ``options.httpMethod`` field to
  the name of the method using all capital letters or ``"ANY"``.

  .. code-block:: json
     
     {
       "options": {
         "httpMethod": "POST"
       }
     }
---
title: Configure the Endpoint Response
ref: configure-the-endpoint-response
content: |
  You can send a configurable :mdn:`HTTP Response
  <Web/HTTP/Messages#HTTP_Responses>` to external services that call the
  endpoint. To configure the endpoint to send a response to incoming
  requests, set ``respond_result`` to ``true``.

  If you enable :guilabel:`Respond With Result`, the endpoint will
  respond to incoming requests with a basic :mdn:`HTTP 200
  <Web/HTTP/Status/200>` response that includes the endpoint function
  return value as its ``body`` field. You can configure a custom HTTP
  response from within the endpoint function using the ``response``
  object that Realm automatically passes as the second argument.
---
title: Specify the Request Validation Method
ref: specify-the-request-validation-method
content: |
  You can configure a endpoint's request authorization method in the
  ``validation_method`` field of the endpoint configuration. Realm
  supports the following :ref:`request validation methods
  <endpoint-request-validation>`:

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 30 70

     * - Method
       - Description
       
     * - No Additional Authorization
       - Incoming endpoint requests do not require additional
         authorization.

         .. code-block:: json
            
            {
              "validation_method": "NO_VALIDATION"
            }
       
     * - Verify Payload Signature
       - Incoming endpoint requests must include a hashed signature of
         the request body and a secret value. For details, refer to
         :ref:`Payload Signature Verification
         <endpoint-verify-payload-signature>`.

         .. code-block:: json
            
            {
              "validation_method": "VERIFY_PAYLOAD",
              "secret_name": "<Secret Name>"
            }
       
     * - Require Secret
       - Incoming endpoint requests must include a secret string value as
         the ``secret`` query parameter in the endpoint URL. For details,
         refer to :ref:`Secret as a Query Parameter
         <endpoint-secret-query-parameter>`.

         .. code-block:: json
            
            {
              "validation_method": "SECRET_AS_QUERY_PARAM",
              "secret_name": "<Secret Name>"
            }
---
title: Add the Endpoint Function Source Code
ref: add-the-endpoint-function-source-code
content: |
  1. Pick a name for the function you would like to run when the endpoint
     receives a request. Use that name as the value of the
     ``function_name`` field in your the endpoint configuration object.

  #. Create a :file:`.js` file with the same name as the function in the
     functions directory or one of its subdirectories. The file
     should contain a valid function that will execute when the endpoint is
     called.

  Realm automatically passes two objects as the endpoint function's
  arguments:

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 10 30

     * - Argument
       - Description

     * - ``payload``
       - An EJSON representation of the incoming request payload. The
         payload document contains:

         - The request query parameters, as an object.

         - The request headers, as an object.

         - The request body, as a binary object. You can access the
           contents as a string using the ``body.text()`` method.

     * - ``response``
       - An :ref:`HTTP response object <endpoint-response-object>` that
         configures Realm's response to the client that called the
         endpoint. The object has methods that allow you to set the
         response's headers, body, and status code. Calling any of these
         methods overrides the default response behavior.

  You can use the following endpoint function as a base for your own endpoint:

  .. literalinclude:: /includes/endpoint-function-example.js
     :language: javascript
     :emphasize-lines: 3, 10-11, 14-15

  .. note::

     If you want to debug a endpoint function response from the function
     editor, you must manually provide the HTTP response object when you
     run the function.

     .. code-block:: javascript

        exports(
          { body: "This document is the endpoint payload" },
          new HTTPResponse()
        )

title: Deploy the Incoming Endpoint Configuration
ref: deploy-the-incoming-endpoint-configuration
content: |
  Push the config to your remote app. {+cli+} immediately deploys the
  update on push.

  .. code-block:: bash
     
     realm-cli push --remote="<Your App ID>"

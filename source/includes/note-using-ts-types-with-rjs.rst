.. note:: 

   We recommend using `TypeScript types
   <https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html>`_ in all
   cases where there is an existing TypeScript type that maps to the :ref:`Realm
   field type <react-native-data-types-field-types>`. However, if there is no
   existing TypeScript type that maps to the Realm field type, you must use the
   Realm type.

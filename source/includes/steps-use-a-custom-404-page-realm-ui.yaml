  You can use any hosted file as your custom 404 page. It's common to
  use an HTML file that incorporates the following elements:

  - A short message indicating the error, e.g. "This page does not
    exist."
  - Alternative links or options for the user to continue navigating.

  Once you've created the custom 404 file, you need to :doc:`upload it
  to {+service+} </hosting/upload-content-to-realm>`. To upload the file,
  navigate to the :guilabel:`Hosting` screen of the {+ui+}, click
  :guilabel:`Upload Files`, and select the custom HTML file.

  Once you have successfully uploaded the 404 file, all that's left is
  to configure {+service-short+} to serve that file instead of the default 404
  page.

  1. On the :guilabel:`Hosting` page, click the :guilabel:`Settings`
     tab.
  2. Under :guilabel:`Custom 404 Page`, click :guilabel:`Choose File`.
  3. Select your custom 404 file from the list.
  4. Click :guilabel:`Save`.

  Once you have updated the :guilabel:`Hosting` configuration, {+service-short+}
  will begin serving your custom file instead of the default 404 page.

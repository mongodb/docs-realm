  Click :guilabel:`Link a Data Source` and provide the following
  configuration information on the :guilabel:`Data Source Configuration` screen:

  .. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 10 30
    
    * - Field
      - Description
    * - :guilabel:`Data Source`
      - A MongoDB Atlas cluster or Data Lake associated with the same project as
        your {+app+}.
    * - :guilabel:`Realm Service Name`
      - A name for the {+service-short+} service that connects to the data source.
        You will use this name when referring to the data source in other
        parts of your application, such as when you instantiate a
        MongoDB service client. 

        .. example::

           Consider a MongoDB cluster data source with the :guilabel:`Realm
           Service Name` ``myAtlasCluster``. To create a service client in a
           :doc:`function </functions>` you would use the following code:

           .. code-block:: javascript
          
              const myAtlasCluster = context.services.get("myAtlasCluster");

    * - | :guilabel:`MongoDB Connection String`
        | *config.wireProtocolEnabled*
      - Required for Atlas clusters. Not enabled for Data Lakes.
        A boolean indicating whether {+service-short+} should allow
        clients to :doc:`connect to this cluster with a connection string over
        the wire protocol </mongodb/connect-over-the-wire-protocol>`.

    * - :guilabel:`Read Preference`
      - Required for Atlas clusters. Not available for Data Lakes. Specifies the
        :ref:`read preference <read-preference>` of the cluster. The default
        read preference (primary) should be sufficient for most use cases.

title: Get the Atlas Project ID
ref: get-project-id
content: |
  To export a {+app+}, you need the Project ID (sometimes referred to as
  the Group ID) of the Atlas project that contains the app. You will
  include this ID in the URL of API requests.

  :ref:`Follow these steps <find-your-project-id>` and note the Project ID.

title: Get the Application ID
ref: get-application-id
content: |
  To export a {+app+} configuration, you need the app's Application ID.
  You will include this ID in the URL of API requests alongside the
  Project ID you just looked up.

title: Export Your Realm App
ref: app-export-endpoint
content: |
  To export your {+app+}, send a request to the app's
  :admin-api-endpoint:`export endpoint
  <operation/adminExportApplication>`. The endpoint URL should includes
  the :admin-api-endpoint:`Project ID
  <section/Project-and-Application-IDs>` and App ID you just looked up.

  Include the access token from the response document of the previous step in a 
  :mdn:`Bearer token <Web/HTTP/Authentication>` ``Authorization`` header.

  .. code-block:: shell

    curl --request GET 'https://realm.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/<projectId>/apps/<appId>/export' \
      --header 'Authorization:  Bearer <access token>' \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json'

  If the request is successful, the endpoint returns a ``200`` response
  and a ``.zip`` file that contains your application's current
  configuration directory.

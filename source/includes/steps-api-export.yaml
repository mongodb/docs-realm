ref: app-export-endpoint
content: |
  You can export your {+app+} through the :admin-api-endpoint:`export endpoint <get-/groups/%7Bgroupid%7D/apps/%7Bappid%7D/export>`.
  Include the access token from the response document of the previous step in a 
  :mdn:`Bearer token <Web/HTTP/Authentication>` ``Authorization`` header. You will also
  need your :ref:`Group ID <realm-api-project-and-application-ids>`.

  .. code-block:: shell

    curl --request GET 'https://realm.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/<groupId>/apps/<appId>/export' \
      --header 'Authorization:  Bearer <access token>' \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --data '{"name": "<name of new app>"}'

  If creation succeeds the {+backend+} returns a ``200`` response and a Zip 
  file that contains your application's configuration.

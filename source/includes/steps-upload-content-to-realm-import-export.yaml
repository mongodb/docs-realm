title: Export Your Realm Application
ref: export-your-application

  To upload files to {+backend+} with :doc:`realm-cli
  </deploy/realm-cli-reference>` you need an :ref:`application
  directory <application-directory>` for your {+app+}.

  You can :doc:`export your application </deploy/export-realm-app>`
  from the :guilabel:`Export` tab of the :guilabel:`Settings` page in
  the {+ui+}, or by running the following command from an
  authenticated instance of :doc:`realm-cli
  </deploy/realm-cli-reference>`:

  .. code-block:: shell

     realm-cli export --app-id=<App ID> --include-hosting
---
title: Add a Hosting Directory
ref: add-a-hosting-directory
content: |
  .. note::

     This step is only necessary if you did not export your {+app+} with the
     ``--include-hosting`` flag.

  {+backend+} looks for files to upload in the ``/hosting/files``
  subdirectory of your application directory. If this directory doesn't
  already exist, create it:

  .. code-block:: shell

     mkdir -p hosting/files
---
title: Add a Metadata Configuration File
ref: add-a-metadata-configuration-file
content: |
  To deploy hosted files through {+cli-bin+} you must include a
  ``metadata.json`` file in the ``/hosting`` directory. If the
  configuration file does not exist, create it:

  .. code-block:: shell

     touch hosting/metadata.json

  The configuration does not need to specify metadata for any files but
  must be present. For more information, see :doc:`Configure File
  Metadata </hosting/configure-file-metadata>`.

  .. include:: /hosting/includes/metadata-config-json.rst

  .. note::

     If you include an entry in ``metadata.json`` for a file that does
     not exist, you will not be able to import your changes. The
     metadata.json must only have hosted files represented.

title: Add Files to the Hosting Directory
ref: add-files-to-the-hosting-directory
content: |
  To upload or edit files, add them to the ``/hosting/files``
  subdirectory of your application directory. When you import your
  application, {+backend+} will map this subdirectory to the root of your
  application's hosted file tree.

  .. note::

     You can nest additional directories inside of the
     ``/hosting/files`` subdirectory. Nested directories are listed
     before a file's name in its resource path.
---
title: Import the Files
ref: import-the-files
content: |
  Once you have added the files you want to host to the
  ``/hosting/files`` subdirectory, you can upload them to {+backend+} by
  importing your updated application directory with the
  ``--include-hosting`` flag:

  .. code-block:: shell

     realm-cli import --include-hosting

  After successfully importing the application directory, {+backend+} will
  begin uploading your files. The rate of upload time will vary depending
  on network connection speed and the number and size of the files
  selected.

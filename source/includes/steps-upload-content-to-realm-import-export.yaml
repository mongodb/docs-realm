title: Add a Hosting Directory
ref: add-a-hosting-directory
content: |
  {+backend+} looks for files to upload in the ``/hosting/files``
  subdirectory of your application directory. If this directory doesn't
  already exist, create it:
  
  .. code-block:: shell
     
     mkdir -p hosting/files
---
title: Add a Metadata Configuration File
ref: add-a-metadata-configuration-file
content: |
  To deploy hosted files through {+cli-bin+} you must include a
  ``metadata.json`` file in the ``/hosting`` directory. If the
  configuration file does not exist, create it:

  .. code-block:: shell

     touch hosting/metadata.json

  The configuration does not need to specify metadata for any files but
  must be present. For more information, see :doc:`Configure File
  Metadata </hosting/configure-file-metadata>`.

  .. include:: /hosting/includes/metadata-config-json.rst

  .. note::

     If you include an entry in ``metadata.json`` for a file that does
     not exist, you will not be able to import your changes. The
     metadata.json must only have hosted files represented.

title: Add Files to the Hosting Directory
ref: add-files-to-the-hosting-directory
content: |
  To upload or edit files, add them to the ``/hosting/files``
  subdirectory of your application directory. When you import your
  application, {+backend+} will map this subdirectory to the root of your
  application's hosted file tree.

  .. note::

     You can nest additional directories inside of the
     ``/hosting/files`` subdirectory. Nested directories are listed
     before a file's name in its resource path.
---
title: Upload the Files
ref: upload-the-files
content: |
  To upload files from the ``/hosting/files`` subdirectory, push your
  configuration directory with the ``--include-hosting`` flag:

  .. code-block:: shell
     
     realm-cli push --include-hosting
  
  .. note::
     
     The upload speed will vary depending on your network connection and the
     number and size of the files that you upload.

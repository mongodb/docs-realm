title: Run the App Creation Command
ref: run-the-app-creation-command
content: |
  The CLI can create an app and copy its :ref:`configuration files
  <app-configuration>` to a local directory with a single command. The command
  asks you to specify the app name and the Atlas project that should contain the
  app. You can configure the command with flags or interactively.

  .. code-block:: shell

     realm-cli app create
  
  The command also supports additional flags that you can optionally include
  to customize your app. The following table lists common flags you might use:

  .. list-table::
     
     * - ``--deployment-model``
       - Defines the app's :ref:`deployment model <deployment-model>`.
         
         Valid values:
         
         - ``GLOBAL``
         - ``LOCAL``
     
     * - ``--location``
       - Defines a local app's :ref:`deployment region <deployment-region>`.
         
         Valid values:
         
         - ``US-VA``

ref: link-a-new-cluster

  Click :guilabel:`Link a Cluster` and provide the following
  configuration information on the :guilabel:`Cluster Configuration`
  screen:

  .. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 10 30
    
    * - Field
      - Description
    * - :guilabel:`Atlas Cluster`
      - A MongoDB Atlas cluster associated with the same project as
        your Realm application
    * - :guilabel:`Realm Service Name`
      - A name for the Realm service that connects to the cluster.
        You will use this name when referring to the cluster in other
        parts of your application, such as when you instantiate a
        MongoDB service client. 

        .. example::
          Consider a MongoDB cluster with the :guilabel:`Realm
          Service Name` ``myAtlasCluster``. To create a service client
          in a :doc:`function </functions>` you would use the
          following code:

          .. code-block:: javascript
          
             const myAtlasCluster = context.services.get("myAtlasCluster");

    * - | :guilabel:`MongoDB Connection String`
        | *config.wireProtocolEnabled*
      - Required. A boolean indicating whether Stitch should allow
        clients to :doc:`connect to this cluster with a connection
        string over the wire protocol
        </mongodb/connect-over-the-wire-protocol>`.

title: Save the Linked Cluster
ref: save-the-linked-cluster
content: |
  Once you've selected and configured a MongoDB cluster, click
  :guilabel:`Save`.
  Realm will immediately begin the process of linking to the cluster,
  which could take up to five minutes. Once Realm is finished linking
  to the cluster, you can start reading and writing data.

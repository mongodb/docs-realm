  Click :guilabel:`Link a Cluster` and provide the following
  configuration information on the :guilabel:`Cluster Configuration`
  screen:

  .. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 10 30
    
    * - Field
      - Description
    * - :guilabel:`Atlas Cluster`
      - A MongoDB Atlas cluster associated with the same project as
        your {+app+}
    * - :guilabel:`Realm Service Name`
      - A name for the {+service-short+} service that connects to the cluster.
        You will use this name when referring to the cluster in other
        parts of your application, such as when you instantiate a
        MongoDB service client. 

        .. example::
          Consider a MongoDB cluster with the :guilabel:`Realm
          Service Name` ``myAtlasCluster``. To create a service client
          in a :doc:`function </functions>` you would use the
          following code:

          .. code-block:: javascript
          
             const myAtlasCluster = context.services.get("myAtlasCluster");

    * - | :guilabel:`MongoDB Connection String`
        | *config.wireProtocolEnabled*
      - Required. A boolean indicating whether {+service-short+} should allow
        clients to :doc:`connect to this cluster with a connection
        string over the wire protocol
        </mongodb/connect-over-the-wire-protocol>`.

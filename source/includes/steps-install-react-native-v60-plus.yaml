  Create your React Native project with the following
  command:

  .. code-block:: bash

     npx react-native init MyRealmApp

  Change to the project directory that the previous command
  just created:

  .. code-block:: bash

     cd MyRealmApp

  In your React Native project directory, add Realm to your

  .. code-block:: bash

     npm install realm@beta

title: Resolve CocoaPods Dependencies
ref: cocoapods-install
content: |

  For the iOS app, fetch the CocoaPods dependencies with
  the following commands from your React Native project
  directory:

  .. code-block:: bash

     cd ios && pod install && cd ..

  This downloads the Realm libraries and regenerates the
  project ``.xcworkspace`` file that you can work with in
  Xcode to run your application.

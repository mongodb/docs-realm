title: Initialize CocoaPods for Your Project
ref: initialize-cocoapods
content: |

  If you do not already have a Podfile for your project,
  run ``pod init`` in the root directory of your project to
  create a Podfile for your project. A Podfile allows you
  to specify project dependencies to CocoaPods.

title: Add Realm as a Dependency in Your Podfile
ref: update-podfile
content: |

  .. tabs-realm-languages::
    
    .. tab::
        :tabid: swift

        Add the line ``use_frameworks!`` if it is not
        already there.
        
        Add the line ``pod 'RealmSwift', '=10.0.0-beta.5'`` to your main and test
        targets.

        When done, your Podfile should look something like this:

        .. code-block:: text
           :emphasize-lines: 8

           platform :ios, '12.0'

           target 'MyRealmProject' do
             # Comment the next line if you don't want to use dynamic frameworks
             use_frameworks!

             # Pods for MyRealmProject
             pod 'RealmSwift', '=10.0.0-beta.5'

           end

    .. tab::
        :tabid: objective-c

        Add the line ``pod 'Realm', '=10.0.0-beta.5'`` to your main and test
        targets.

        Add the line ``use_frameworks!`` as well if it is not
        already there.

        When done, your Podfile should look something like this:

        .. code-block:: text
           :emphasize-lines: 6, 9, 14

           # Uncomment the next line to define a global platform for your project
           # platform :ios, '9.0'

           target 'MyRealmProject' do
           # Comment the next line if you don't want to use dynamic frameworks
           use_frameworks!

           # Pods for MyRealmProject
           pod 'Realm', '=10.0.0-beta.5'

           target 'MyRealmProjectTests' do
              inherit! :search_paths
              # Pods for testing
              pod 'Realm', '=10.0.0-beta.5'
           end

           end

title: Use the CocoaPods-Generated ``.xcworkspace`` File
ref: use-xcworkspace

  CocoaPods generates an ``.xcworkspace`` file for you. This
  file has all of the dependencies configured. From now on,
  open this file -- not the ``.xcodeproj`` file -- to work
  on your project.

  In the options for the ``realm-swift`` package which comes up, leave the default 
  ``Dependency Rule`` of ``Up to Next Major``, then click ``Add Package``.

  .. tip::

     If you are using Xcode version 13.1 to install the RealmSwift SDK,
     you may run into an issue where ``Up to Next Major`` installs version
     ~5.x instead of ~10.x. This is related to the way Xcode 13.1 handles
     versions, and will hopefully be resolved in a future Xcode release.
     
     Meanwhile, you can bypass this issue in one of two ways:

     - Set the version as ``Up to Next Major`` and set the minimum version to
       ``10.19.0`` (or the minimum version you want to install)
     - Choose ``Exact``, and specify the version you want to install

  In the options for the ``realm-cocoa`` package which comes up, leave the default 
  ``Dependency Rule`` of ``Up to Next Major``, then click ``Add Package``.

  .. tip::

     If you are using Xcode version 13.1 to install the RealmSwift SDK,
     you may run into an issue where ``Up to Next Major`` installs an old
     version of the SDK. You can resolve this issue in one of two ways:

     - Set the version as ``Up to Next Major`` and set the minimum version to
       ``10.19.0`` (or the minimum version you want to install)
     - Choose ``Exact``, and specify the version you want to install

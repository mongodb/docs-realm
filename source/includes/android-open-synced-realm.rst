To open a synced {+realm+}, call 
:java-sdk:`getInstanceAsync()
<io/realm/Realm.html#getInstanceAsync-io.realm.RealmConfiguration-io.realm.Realm.Callback->`, 
passing in a :java-sdk:`SyncConfiguration <io/realm/mongodb/sync/SyncConfiguration.html>` 
object. The following code demonstrates how to create a {+realm+} with 
specific sync settings created using a ``SyncConfiguration`` object:

.. tabs-realm-languages::
   
   .. tab::
       :tabid: kotlin

       .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/android/sync/OpenARealmTest.codeblock.allow-reads-writes-ui-thread.kt
         :language: kotlin

   .. tab::
       :tabid: java

       .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/android/sync/OpenARealmTest.codeblock.allow-reads-writes-ui-thread.java
         :language: java

The code above shows how to open the {+realm+} *asynchronously* 
by using :java-sdk:`getInstanceAsync()
<io/realm/Realm.html#getInstanceAsync-io.realm.RealmConfiguration-io.realm.Realm.Callback->`. 
You can also open a {+realm+} synchronously by using :java-sdk:`getInstance()
<io/realm/Realm.html#getInstance-io.realm.RealmConfiguration->`, which
returns an open {+realm+} before synchronizing all data from the backend.
However, this may lead to temporary data inconsistencies while the
remote data is downloaded, and is generally not recommended. You can
use the :java-sdk:`waitForInitialRemoteData() <io/realm/mongodb/sync/SyncConfiguration.Builder.html#waitForInitialRemoteData-->`
configuration option to force the SDK to fetch remote data before
opening the {+realm+} to avoid these inconsistencies.

The :ref:`partition value <partition-value>` specifies which subset of your data to sync.
This is typically a user ID, project ID, store ID, or some other category identifier in
your app that has particular relevance to the current user.

title: Export Your Realm Application
ref: export-your-realm-application
content: |
  To create new incoming webhook with :doc:`realm-cli
  </deploy/realm-cli-reference>`, you need a
  previously created :ref:`application configuration <application-directory>`.

  You can :doc:`export </deploy/export-realm-app>` your application from the
  :guilabel:`Import/Export App` tab of the :guilabel:`Deploy` page in the
  {+ui+}, or by running the following command from an authenticated instance of
  :doc:`realm-cli </deploy/realm-cli-reference>`:

  .. code-block:: shell

     realm-cli export --app-id=<App ID>
---
title: Add a Webhook Configuration Directory
ref: add-a-webhook-configuration-directory
content: |
  Create a new subdirectory in the ``/<service>/incoming_webhooks``
  folder of the application directory that you exported, where
  ``<service>`` is the service that you want to add a webhook to. The
  name of the subdirectory should match the configured name of the
  webhook.

  .. code-block:: shell

     mkdir -p services/<service>/incoming_webhooks/<webhook name>
---
title: Add a Webhook Configuration File
ref: add-a-webhook-configuration-file
content: |
  Add a file named ``config.json`` to the new webhook directory.
  The configuration file should have the following form:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     {
       "name": "<Unique Webhook Name>",
       "respond_result": <boolean>,
       "run_as_authed_user": <boolean>,
       "run_as_user_id": "<Realm User ID>",
       "run_as_user_id_script_source": "<Stringified Function>",
       "can_evaluate": <JSON Expression>,
       "disable_arg_logs": <boolean>,
       "options": <document>,
     }
---
title: Name the New Webhook
ref: name-the-new-webhook
content: |
  Enter a name for the webhook in the configuration file's ``name``
  field. This name must be distinct from any other webhooks that you've
  created for the service.

  .. code-block:: json
     
     {
       "name": "<Unique Webhook Name>"
     }
---
title: Configure User Authentication
ref: configure-user-authentication
content: |
  Specify the type of authentication that Realm should use for the
  webhook. Realm supports the following webhook authentication methods:

  .. list-table::
     :widths: 20 80
     :header-rows: 1
     
     * - Authentication Method
       - Description
     
     * - Application Authentication
       - This type of authentication configures a webhook to run in the
         context of an existing application user specified by each
         incoming request. Incoming requests must include the user's
         :doc:`authentication provider </authentication/providers>`
         credentials in either the request body or the request headers.

         To configure a webhook to use application authentication, set
         the value of ``run_as_authed_user`` to ``true``:

         .. code-block:: json
            
            {
              "run_as_authed_user": true,
              "run_as_user_id": "",
              "run_as_user_id_script_source": "",
            }

         .. example::
         
            The following examples demonstrate the field names and
            values that incoming requests should include as body or
            header fields for each supported authentication provider:

            .. tabs-realm-auth-providers::
               
               .. tab::
                  :tabid: local-userpass
                  
                  .. code-block:: json
                        
                     {
                       "email": "<User's Email Address>",
                       "password": "<User's Password>"
                     }
               
               .. tab::
                  :tabid: api-key
                  
                  .. code-block:: json
                        
                     {
                       "api-key": "<User's API Key>"
                     }
               
               .. tab::
                  :tabid: custom-token
                  
                  .. code-block:: json
                        
                     {
                       "jwtTokenString": "<User's JWT Token>"
                     }
            
            .. important:: Do Not Use Both Headers and Body Fields
               
               If a request includes credentials in both the request
               headers and the request body, then Realm throws an error
               and does not execute the function.
     
     * - System
       - This type of authentication configures a webhook to run as the
         :ref:`system user <system-user>`, whichc has full
         access to MongoDB CRUD and Aggregation APIs and is
         not affected by any rules, roles, or permissions.

         To configure a webhook to run as a system user, do not set any
         other authentication fields:

         .. code-block:: json
            
            {
              "run_as_authed_user": false,
              "run_as_user_id": "",
              "run_as_user_id_script_source": "",
            }
     
     * - User ID
       - This type of authentication configures a webhook to always run
         as a specific application user.

         To configure a webhook to always run as a specific user, set
         ``run_as_user_id`` to the user's id:

         .. code-block:: json
            
            {
              "run_as_authed_user": false,
              "run_as_user_id": "<Realm User ID>",
              "run_as_user_id_script_source": "",
            }
     
     * - Script
       - This type of authentication configures a webhook to run as a
         specific application user determined based on the result of a
         custom :doc:`function </functions>` that you define. The
         function must return a specific user's ``id`` string or can
         specify a system user by returning ``{ "runAsSystemUser":
         true}``.

         To configure a webhook to run as a user determined by a
         function, set ``run_as_user_id_script_source`` to the
         stringified function code:

         .. code-block:: json
            
            {
              "run_as_authed_user": false,
              "run_as_user_id": "",
              "run_as_user_id_script_source": "<Stringified Function>",
            }
---
title: Specify the Webhook's HTTP Method
ref: specify-the-webhooks-http-method
content: |
  You can require that incoming requests use a specific :mdn:`HTTP
  method <Web/HTTP/Methods>` or you can accept all HTTP methods and
  handle each one individually in the webhook function by inspecting the
  ``httpMethod`` property on the :ref:`context.request
  <context-request>` object, as in the following example function:

  .. include:: /services/examples/webhook-http-method-handler.rst

  To specify a webhook method, set the ``options.httpMethod`` field to
  the name of the method using all capital letters or ``"ANY"``.

  .. code-block:: json
     
     {
       "options": {
         "httpMethod": "POST"
       }
     }
---
title: Configure the Webhook Response
ref: configure-the-webhook-response
content: |
  You can send a configurable :mdn:`HTTP Response
  <Web/HTTP/Messages#HTTP_Responses>` to external services that call the
  webhook. To configure the webhook to send a response to incoming
  requests, set ``respond_result`` to ``true``.

  If you enable :guilabel:`Respond With Result`, the webhook will
  respond to incoming requests with a basic :mdn:`HTTP 200
  <Web/HTTP/Status/200>` response that includes the webhook function
  return value as its ``body`` field. You can configure a custom HTTP
  response from within the webhook function using the ``response``
  object that Realm automatically passes as the second argument.
---
title: Specify an Authorization Expression
ref: specify-an-authorization-expression
content: |
  You can dynamically authorize requests based on the contents of each
  request by defining a :guilabel:`Can Evaluate` :doc:`JSON expression
  </services/json-expressions>`. Realm evaluates the expression for
  every incoming request that the webhook receives. The expression can
  expand standard :doc:`expression variables
  </services/expression-variables>`, including the
  :json-expansion:`%%request` expansion.
  
  To define an authorization expression, set the value of the
  ``can_evaluate`` field to the expression. If you do not specify an
  expression then Realm automatically authorizes all authenticated
  incoming requests.

  .. example::
     
     The following expression only authorizes incoming requests if the
     sender's IP address is not included in the list of addresses.

     .. code-block:: json
        
        {
            "%%request.remoteIPAddress": {
                "%nin": [
                    "248.88.57.58",
                    "19.241.23.116",
                    "147.64.232.1"
                ]
            }
        }
---
title: Specify the Request Validation Method
ref: specify-the-request-validation-method
content: |
  To validate that a webhook request was sent from a trusted source,
  some external services require that incoming requests incorporate a
  secret string in one of several prescribed manners. Other services,
  like the :doc:`HTTP service </services/http>`, allow you to optionally
  require request validation.

  You can configure a webhook's request authorization method in the
  ``options`` document of the webhook configuration. Realm supports the
  following :ref:`request validation methods
  <webhook-request-validation>`:

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 30 70
  
     * - Method
       - Description
       
     * - No Additional Authorization
       - Incoming webhook requests do not require additional
         authorization.

         .. code-block:: json
            
            {
              "validationMethod": "NO_VALIDATION"
            }
       
     * - Verify Payload Signature
       - Incoming webhook requests must include a hashed signature of
         the request body and a secret value. For details, refer to
         :ref:`Payload Signature Verification
         <webhook-verify-payload-signature>`.

         .. code-block:: json
            
            {
              "validationMethod": "VERIFY_PAYLOAD",
              "secret": "<Secret Value>"
            }
       
     * - Require Secret
       - Incoming webhook requests must include a secret string value as
         the ``secret`` query parameter in the webhook URL. For details,
         refer to :ref:`Secret as a Query Parameter
         <webhook-secret-query-parameter>`.

         .. code-block:: json
            
            {
              "validationMethod": "SECRET_AS_QUERY_PARAM",
              "secret": "<Secret Value>"
            }
---
title: Add the Webhook Function Source Code
ref: add-the-webhook-function-source-code
content: |
  Add a file named ``source.js`` to the new webhook directory. The file
  should contain a valid function that will execute when the webhook is
  called.

  Realm automatically passes two objects as the webhook function's
  arguments:

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 10 30

     * - Argument
       - Description

     * - ``payload``
       - An EJSON representation of the incoming request payload. The
         contents of the payload document will vary depending on the
         service and event that caused a webhook to fire. For a
         description of the ``payload`` object for a specific service,
         see that service's reference page.

     * - ``response``
       - An :ref:`HTTP response object <webhook-response-object>` that
         configures Realm's response to the client that called the
         webhook. The object has methods that allow you to set the
         response's headers, body, and status code. Calling any of these
         methods overrides the default response behavior.

  You can use the following webhook function as a base for your own webhook:

  .. code-block:: javascript
     :emphasize-lines: 3, 10-11, 14-15

     exports = async function(payload, response) {
       // Convert the webhook body from BSON to an EJSON object
       const body = EJSON.parse(payload.body.text());

       // Execute application logic, such as working with MongoDB
       if(body.someField) {
         const mdb = context.services.get('mongodb-atlas');
         const requests = mdb.db("demo").collection("requests")
         const { insertedId } = await requests.insertOne({ someField: body.someField });
         // Respond with an affirmative result
         response.setStatusCode(200)
         response.setBody(`Successfully saved "someField" with _id: ${insertedId}.`);
       } else {
         // Respond with a malformed request error
         response.setStatusCode(400)
         response.setBody(`Could not find "someField" in the webhook request body.`);
       }
       // This return value does nothing because we already modified the response object.
       // If you do not modify the response object and you enable *Respond with Result*,
       // Realm will include this return value as the response body.
       return { msg: "finished!" };
     }
---
title: Import the Webhook
ref: import-the-webhook
content: |
  Once you have added the appropriate configuration files to the webhook
  subdirectory, you can import the webhook into your application.

  Navigate to the root of the application directory and run the
  following command:

  .. code-block:: shell

     realm-cli import

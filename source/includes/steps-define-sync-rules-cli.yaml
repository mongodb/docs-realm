title: Export Your Realm Application
ref: export-your-application
content: |
  To define roles and permissions with :doc:`realm-cli
  </deploy/realm-cli-reference>`, export an
  :ref:`application directory <application-directory>` for
  your application.

  You can :doc:`export </deploy/export-realm-app>` your
  application from the :guilabel:`Export` tab of the
  :guilabel:`Settings` page in the {+ui+}, or by running the
  following command from an authenticated instance of :doc:`realm-cli
  </deploy/realm-cli-reference>`:

  .. code-block:: shell

     realm-cli export --app-id=<App ID>

title: Add a Rule Configuration File
ref: add-a-rule-configuration-file
content: |
  The sync rules for a cluster are configured in the
  :ref:`configuration file <service-configuration-file>` of
  the cluster:

  .. code-block:: shell

     touch services/<cluster name>/config.json

  The configuration file should have the following general form:

  .. code-block:: json

     {
       "roles": [],
       "filters": [],
       "schema": {}
     }

---
title: Add One or More Roles
ref: add-one-or-more-roles
content: |
  Add a document to the ``roles`` array for each role that you want to
  configure. Role documents have the following form:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     {
       "name": "<Role Name>",
       "apply_when": <JSON Expression>,
       "read": <boolean>,
       "write": <boolean>
     }

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 15 40

     * - Field
       - Description

     * - ``name``
       - Required. The name of the role. Limited to 100 characters or
         fewer.

     * - ``apply_when``
       - Required. A :doc:`JSON expression </services/json-expressions>` that
         determines when this role applies to a given partition.

     * - ``read``
       - Optional. Default: ``false``. A boolean that, if ``true``,
         indicates that the role has permission to sync and
         read *all* objects in a partition.

     * - ``write``
       - Optional. Default: ``false``. A boolean that, if ``true``,
         indicates that the role has permission to sync and
         write to *all* objects in a partition.

title: Import Your Application Directory
ref: import-your-application-directory
content: |
  Once you have added your role configurations to the
  cluster sync configuration file, all that's left is to
  import the rule.

  Ensure that the rule configuration file is saved, then
  navigate to the root of the exported application
  directory. Log in to MongoDB Atlas with {+cli-bin+}:

  .. code-block:: shell

     realm-cli login --api-key="<my api key>" --private-api-key="<my private api key>"

  Once you're logged in, import the directory:

  .. code-block:: shell

     realm-cli import

  Once the import completes, {+service-short+} will immediately begin
  using the roles you defined for all incoming requests to
  sync that partition.

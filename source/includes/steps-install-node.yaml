title: Enable TypeScript (optional)
ref: enable-typescript
content: |

  TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static
  type checking and other features intended to make
  application-scale development more robust. If you'd like
  to use TypeScript, follow the TypeScript team's official
  `Node Starter guide
  <https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Node-Starter#typescript--node>`__.
  {+service-short+} supports TypeScript natively and integrates easily
  into a TypeScript project.

  On the :guilabel:`Hosting` configuration page, click :guilabel:`Enable
  Hosting`. {+backend+} will begin provisioning hosting for your application.

  .. note::

     It may take a few minutes for {+backend+} to finish provisioning hosting
     for your application once you've enabled it. You can :doc:`upload
     content to {+backend+} </hosting/upload-content-to-realm>` immediately,
     but you will need to wait for provisioning to complete before
     {+backend+} serves your files.

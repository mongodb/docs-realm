Initialize Realm
----------------

Before you can use {+service-short+} in your app, you must
initialize the {+service-short+} library. Your application should
initialize {+service-short+} just once each time the application runs.

To initialize the {+service-short+} library, provide an Android
``context`` to the ``Realm.init()`` static function. You can provide
an Activity, Fragment, or Application ``context`` for initialization with no
difference in behavior. You can initialize the {+service-short+} library
in the ``onCreate()`` method of an `application subclass
<https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Application>`__ to
ensure that you only initialize {+service-short+} once each time the
application runs.

.. note:: Register Your Application Subclass in the Android Manifest
   
   If you create your own ``Application`` subclass, you must add it to your
   application's ``AndroidManifest.xml`` to execute your custom
   application code. Set the ``android.name`` property of your manifest's
   application definition to ensure that Android instantiates your ``Application``
   subclass before any other class when a user launches your application.

  To add the {+service-short+} Flutter SDK to your project, run the command:

  .. code-block:: 

     flutter pub add realm

  This downloads the ``realm`` package and adds it to your project. 
  In your ``pubspec.yaml`` file, you should see:

  .. code-block:: yaml
     :caption: pubspec.yaml

     dependencies:
       realm: ^0.1.0+preview

---
title: Import Realm Package
ref: import-realm-package
content: |

  To use the {+service-short+} Flutter SDK within your app, import the package 
  into files where you will use it:

  .. code-block:: dart

     import 'package:realm/realm.dart';

---
title: Configure Generation of Realm Objects
ref: configure-generation-realm-objects
content: |

  .. _configure-generation-realm-objects:

  To generate {+client-db-short+} Object classes for your app, you also have do
  additional configuration. 

  Add the `build_runner <https://pub.dev/packages/build_runner>`__ package as a 
  development dependency:

  .. code-block::

     flutter pub add build_runner --dev

  Enable `realm_generator` by creating a `build.yaml` file with the following contents:

  .. code-block:: yaml
     :caption: build.yaml 

     targets:
      $default:
          builders:
              realm_generator|realm_object_builder:
                  enabled: true
                  generate_for:
                      - lib/*.dart 

  Now you can generate Realm RealmObject classes from your :ref:`data model classes <flutter-define-object-model>` by running:

  .. code-block::

     flutter pub run build_runner build

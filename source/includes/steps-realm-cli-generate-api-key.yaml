  Copy your Private Key to a safe location for later use. For security,
  the Private Key will not be visible again after initialization.
  Another security feature is API Whitelisting. Creating an API
  Whitelist ensures that API calls originate from whitelisted IPs. 
  
  The IP Address of the user who will be using the API Key is required
  to use the key. Click the :guilabel:`Add Whitelist Entry` button to
  whitelist an IP address. Type in the IP Address or click the
  :guilabel:`Use Current IP Address` buttton and click save.  Finally,
  click the done button on your screen's lower right-hand to finish
  setting up your API key.

title: Set up Your Application Files
ref: setup-application-files
content: |
  To begin developing your application, create an application directory:

  .. code-block:: shell

     mkdir myElectronApplication
     
  Create an index.html and main.js file in the root directory of
  your application. The code in the main.js file is the Electron main
  process file, which can be thought of as the entry point into your
  application. The main.js file is responsible for loading your
  index.html file into the BrowserWindow created by Electron.

  .. note::

     Each Electron application can only have one **main process**. The
     main process creates web pages. Each web page runs in its
     own process, known as a ``renderer process``. To learn more about
     this, read the official `Electron Application
     Architecture <https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/application-architecture>`_
     doc.

title: Set up a ``package.json``
ref: setup-packagejson
content: |
  Initialize a package.json to begin installing packages and using them
  in your project. Run the following command in your terminal:

  .. code-block:: shell

     npm init -y
---
title: Install Your Project Dependencies
ref: install-dependencies
content: |
  In order to begin developing your Electron Application that uses
  Realm, install the necessary dependencies. Install electron as a dev
  dependency by running the following command:

  .. code-block:: shell

     npm install electron --save-dev

  Install Realm by running the following command:

  .. code-block:: shell

     npm install realm@beta

---
title: Create a Script to Run Your Application
ref: create-script-to-run-app
content: |
  Add a script to your ``package.json`` file to run your application.

  .. code-block:: json

     "scripts": {
      "start": "electron ."
     }

  Running the command ``npm start`` will now start your Electron app.
---
title: Create a Browser Window Using Your Main Process
ref: create-browser-window
content: |
  In order to display HTML to the users, your application needs a
  browser window. Create a `browser window
  <https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/browser-window>`_ using the
  Electron API. Copy the following code into your ``main.js`` file:

  .. literalinclude:: /examples/QuickStarts/electron/quickstart-setup-main.js
    :language: javascript
    :emphasize-lines: 2, 8
    :linenos:

  Notice the ``require("realm")`` on line 2. This line makes Realm
  accessible in this main process file.

title: Run Your Application
ref: run-electron-app
content: |
  In order to run your application, enter the following into your terminal:

  .. code-block:: shell

     npm start

  You should see the following:

  .. cssclass:: bordered-figure
  .. figure:: /images/electron-app.png

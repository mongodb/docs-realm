title: Export Your Realm Application
ref: export-your-application
content: |
  You can configure the read preference for a linked cluster by
  importing an :ref:`application directory <application-directory>` that
  includes a cluster configuration file with your desired settings.
  If you're configuring read preference for an existing {+app+},
  the most straightforward method is to :doc:`export
  </deploy/export-realm-app>` your application, update the
  cluster configuration, and then import the updated directory.
  To export your application, click the :guilabel:`Export App` button on
  the :guilabel:`Import/Export App` tab of the :guilabel:`Deploy` page in the
  {+ui+} or run the following command from an authenticated instance
  of :doc:`realm-cli </deploy/realm-cli-reference>`:

  .. code-block:: shell

     realm-cli export --app-id=<App ID>

title: Specify a Cluster Read Preference
ref: specify-a-cluster-read-preference
content: |
  Configure the read preference for a linked cluster in the cluster's
  ``config.json`` file. Locate this file in the cluster's
  :ref:`configuration directory <appschema-services>` within the
  application directory (``/services/<MongoDB Service Name>``). To
  specify a read preference, set the value of ``config.readPreference``:

  .. code-block:: json
     :emphasize-lines: 5

     {
        "name": "<MongoDB Service Name>",
        "type": "mongodb-atlas",
        "config": {
           "readPreference": "<Read Preference Mode>"
        }
     }

  The following read preference modes are available:

  .. include:: /mongodb/tables/read-preference-modes.rst

title: Specify Read Preference Tags
ref: specify-read-preference-tags
content: |
  If you specify a read preference other than ``primary``, you can also
  specify one or more :manual:`read preference tags
  </core/read-preference/#replica-set-read-preference-tag-sets>`. To
  serve a read request, a :manual:`replica set member
  </core/replica-set-members>` must include all of the specified read
  preference tags in its node configuration. To specify a read
  preference tag set for a cluster, ensure that you have specified a
  ``readPreference`` other than ``primary``, and then add one or more
  tag definition objects to ``config.readPreferenceTagSets``:

  .. code-block:: json
     :emphasize-lines: 6-9

     {
        "name": "<MongoDB Service Name>",
        "type": "mongodb-atlas",
        "config": {
           "readPreference": "<Read Preference Mode (other than primary)>",
           "readPreferenceTagSets": [
              { <Tag Key>: <Tag Value> },
              ...
           ],
        }
     }

  .. note:: Atlas Cluster Tag Sets
     
     Atlas clusters are configured with pre-defined tag sets for each
     member node depending on the member's type. For detailed information
     on which tags are defined nodes in an Atlas cluster, see :atlas:`Atlas
     Replica Set Tags </reference/replica-set-tags>`.

title: Import Your Application Directory
ref: import-your-application-directory
content: |
  Once you have specified a :guilabel:`Read Preference` and any
  :guilabel:`Read Preference Tags`, navigate to the root of the
  application directory and run the following command from an
  authenticated instance of :doc:`realm-cli
  </deploy/realm-cli-reference>`:

  .. code-block:: shell

     realm-cli import

  Once the import completes, {+backend+} immediately routes all incoming
  database read requests for the cluster according to your preference.

  .. note::

     For a detailed walkthrough of importing an application directory,
     see :doc:`Deploy Changes with {+cli+}
     </deploy/deploy-cli>`

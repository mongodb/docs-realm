  Click the :guilabel:`Add` button to start adding the package. 
  
  You can track the status of adding the dependency in the progress tracker 
  at the bottom of the window. The progress tracker provides a message letting

  If drafts are enabled, you will also need to click :guilabel:`Review & Deploy`
  to apply these changes.

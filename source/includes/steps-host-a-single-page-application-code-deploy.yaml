title: Get a Local Copy of Your Realm App
ref: get-a-local-copy-of-your-realm-app
content: |
  To use code deploy to configure a SPA, you need a local copy of your
  :ref:`application directory <application-directory>` that is
  up-to-date with the latest version of your {+app+}. Clone
  the most recent version of your {+app+} from GitHub or export it
  directly from {+backend+}.

  .. admonition:: Export Your Application
     :class: note
  
     You can :doc:`export </deploy/export-realm-app>` a copy of the
     latest version of your application directory from the
     :guilabel:`Import/Export App` tab of the :guilabel:`Deploy` page in
     the {+ui+}, or by running the following command from an
     authenticated instance of :doc:`realm-cli
     </deploy/realm-cli-reference>`:
     
     .. code-block:: shell
     
        realm-cli export --app-id=<App ID>

title: Add Your Built Application Code
ref: add-your-built-application-code
content: |
  Single-page applications render in a single, specific HTML file,
  typically ``/index.html``. The file should include the necessary
  JavaScript code to wire up and render your application, either inline
  in a ``<script>`` tag or imported from an external file. You'll also
  need to host any resources that you don't intend to access through a
  CDN.
  
  When you are ready to host your SPA, run your application's build
  script and then copy the output build folder into the
  ``/hosting/files`` directory of your application directory.

title: Configure Realm to Serve Your Application
ref: configure-realm-to-serve-your-application
content: |
  In :ref:`config.json <appschema-realm-config>`, set the value of
  ``hosting.default_response_code`` to ``200`` and set the value of
  ``hosting.default_error_path`` to the :ref:`resource path
  <hosting-resource-path>` of your SPA's root HTML file. Make sure to
  save the file when you're done.

  .. code-block:: json
     :caption: ``config.json``
  
     "hosting": {
       "enabled": true,
       "default_response_code": 200,
       "default_error_path": "/index.html",
     }

title: Deploy Your Changes
ref: deploy-your-changes
content: |
  Now that you've added the SPA code to the ``hosting/files`` directory
  and configured {+service-short+} to serve the root HTML file, all that's left is
  to deploy the changes.

  Navigate to the application directory root and then run the command
  that matches your deployment method.

  If you want to :doc:`deploy with {+cli+}
  </deploy/deploy-cli>`:
  
  .. code-block:: shell
     
     realm-cli import --include-hosting
  
  If you want to :doc:`deploy automatically with GitHub
  </deploy/deploy-automatically-with-github>`:

  .. code-block:: shell
     
     git add -A
     git commit -m "<descriptive commit message>"
     git push <github remote> <branch>
...

  Before you can use Mac Catalyst in your React Native application, you must
  specify the platform name. Click :guilabel:`Build Phases` in XCode, and within
  the :guilabel:`Bundle React Native code and images` tab, add the following to
  specify "ios" as the platform name.

  .. code-block:: none
   
   export PLATFORM_NAME=ios

title: Update Your Podfile

  .. note:: 
   
   This is a temporary step that will not be necessary when the following Cocoapods issue is solved:
   :github:`[Catalyst] Podspec Resource Bundle requires a development team <CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/8891>`

  Currently, there is a :github:`Cocoapods bug
  <CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/8891>` that causes XCode to require a development
  team when building for Mac Catalyst. This bug prevents signing locally. As a
  workaround, you can alter your Podfile to fix your bundle target's signing
  certificate to sign to run locally.

  Replace the post-install script in your Podfile by removing the following lines:

  .. code-block:: none
     :caption: /ios/Podfile
   
   post_install do |installer|
     react_native_post_install(installer)
   end

  And copy the following lines where your previous post-install script was:

  .. code-block:: none
     :caption: /ios/Podfile
   
   post_install do |installer|
     react_native_post_install(installer)
     installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
       # Fix bundle targets' 'Signing Certificate' to 'Sign to Run Locally'
       if target.respond_to?(:product_type) and target.product_type == "com.apple.product-type.bundle"
         target.build_configurations.each do |config|
           config.build_settings['CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY[sdk=macosx*]'] = '-'
         end
       end
     end
   end

  To test out Catalyst in your project, activate Mac in the :guilabel:`general`
  tab of your XCode project workspace. To do this, click :guilabel:`Mac` in the
  :guilabel:`Deployment Info` section. Select :guilabel:`"Scale Interface to Match iPad"`.  
  This makes "My Mac" selectable, allowing you to run your application on your Mac.

  Before adding new code, it's a good idea to make sure the
  project is set up correctly and you can compile and run
  the app. Test your app by selecting a simulator from the
  build menu and pressing the Run button. Xcode should build
  and launch your app successfully and present you with a
  simulator with the empty app.

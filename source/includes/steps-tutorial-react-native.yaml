title: Create a New React Native Project
ref: create-a-new-rn-project
content: |
  You can :github:`use npx </react-native-community/cli#using-npx-recommended>`
  to create your React Native app. Open your terminal and run the following
  commands:

  .. code-block:: sh

     npx react-native init tasktracker
     cd tasktracker

---
title: Install Dependencies
ref: install-dependencies
content: |

  Within the directory that ``react-native init`` generated for you, run the
  following command to install the {+realm+} module:

  .. code-block:: sh

     npm install realm@v10.0.0-beta.9

  In this tutorial, we'll also use the `React Native Elements
  <https://react-native-elements.github.io/react-native-elements/>`__ library
  for our UI. Install with the following command:

  .. code-block:: sh

     npm i react-native-elements react-native-vector-icons

  If you are planning to build for iOS, edit the ``ios/Podfile`` file and change
  the first line to set the minimum target iOS version:

  .. code-block:: text

     platform :ios, '12.0'

  In the ``ios/`` directory, complete the dependency installation with
  CocoaPods:

  .. code-block:: sh

     cd ios
     pod install
     cd ..
---
title: Run the App
ref: run-the-app
content: |

  Now that you have installed the dependencies, it's a good idea to run the app
  to make sure everything is working. Run the following command to build and
  launch the app:

  .. code-block:: sh

     npx react-native run-ios

  .. note::  
    
     We're using iOS here, but you can use ``run-android`` to build for Android
     and run on an Android simulator, if you'd prefer.

  After a few minutes of building, a simulator window should appear showing the
  default React Native app screen. Now we're ready to start adding React components.

title: Initialize the Realm App Client
ref: initialize-the-realm-app
content: |

  In client code, you interact with your {+app+} through an app object. We need
  to access this object from anywhere in the project code, so let's make it
  globally accessible.

  Create a file in your project directory called ``getRealmApp.js`` and paste
  the following code. Be sure to change ``<enter your Realm app ID here>`` to
  your {+app+} ID, which you can find in the {+ui+}.

  .. include:: /includes/note-find-app-id.rst

  .. code-block:: js
     :emphasize-lines: 8

     import Realm from 'realm';

     let app;

     // Returns the shared instance of the Realm app.
     export function getRealmApp() {
       if (app === undefined) {
         const appId = '<enter your Realm app ID here>'; // Set Realm app ID here.
         const appConfig = {
           id: appId,
           timeout: 10000,
           app: {
             name: 'default',
             version: '0',
           },
         };
         app = new Realm.App(appConfig);
       }
       return app;
     }

  First, we import the {+service-short+} module that we installed earlier. Then,
  we expose a function that initializes the app the first time it is called,
  making it easy to access the app instance from anywhere in the code.

title: Define the AuthProvider
ref: define-the-auth-provider
content: |

  In this tutorial, we'll use React `Context
  <https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html>`__ and `hooks
  <https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html>`__ to pass {+realm+}
  data and authentication to the view components of the app.

  .. note::

     If you aren't familiar with these patterns, don't worry. We'll try to
     explain as we walk through the example. For more information, please take a
     moment to refer to the official React documentation on `Context
     <https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html>`__ and `hooks
     <https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html>`__.

  Create a new file in your project directory called ``AuthProvider.js``. Here
  we define a React component that will act as the Provider of a shared context
  containing all of the actions and data that has to do with authentication. Any
  child components under the Provider will have access to that context and will
  re-render whenever that Provider's state changes.

  In ``AuthProvider.js``, begin by importing the relevant modules and the
  ``getRealmApp`` function we just defined:

  .. code-block:: js

     import React, {useContext, useState} from 'react';
     import Realm from 'realm';
     import {getRealmApp} from './getRealmApp';

  Next, declare some of the module-scoped variables we'll need to define our provider:

  .. code-block:: js

     // Access the Realm App.
     const app = getRealmApp();

     // Create a new Context object that will be provided to descendants of the AuthProvider.
     const AuthContext = React.createContext(null);

  The next code block defines the AuthProvider itself. Define the AuthProvider
  as a component that accepts child components in its props. Use the `state hook
  <https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html>`__ to hold the user object. When
  this user state variable changes due to login or logout, the child components
  re-render, as if "notified" of the change.

  Define the actions around authentication that child components can use to
  affect the authentication state. In this case, we define a ``logIn()``
  function that uses the email/password authentication provider to log in and a
  ``logOut()`` function to log out. Both functions update the user state
  variable, which triggers a re-render of the child components. We also define
  a ``registerUser()`` method which creates a user, but does not log that user in
  and thus does not trigger a rerender.

  Finally, render the Provider of the ``AuthContext`` defined above. By setting
  its ``value`` prop to an object containing all of our state and actions, we
  make the ``user`` object and the ``logIn()``, ``logOut()`` and ``registerUser()`` 
  functions available to child components. 

  .. code-block:: js

     // The AuthProvider is responsible for user management and provides the
     // AuthContext value to its descendants. Components under an AuthProvider can
     // use the useAuth() hook to access the auth value.
     const AuthProvider = ({children}) => {
       const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

       // The log in function takes an email and password and uses the Email/Password
       // authentication provider to log in.
       const logIn = async (email, password) => {
         console.log(`Logging in as ${email}...`);
         const creds = Realm.Credentials.emailPassword(email, password);
         const newUser = await app.logIn(creds);
         setUser(newUser);
         console.log(`Logged in as ${newUser.id}`);
       };

       // Log out the current user.
       const logOut = () => {
         if (user == null) {
           console.warn("Not logged in -- can't log out!");
           return;
         }
         console.log('Logging out...');
         user.logOut();
         setUser(null);
       };

       // The register function takes an email and password and uses the emailPassword
       // authentication provider to register the user.
       const registerUser = async (email, password) => {
         console.log(`Registering as ${email}...`);
         await app.emailPasswordAuth.registerUser(email, password);
       };

       return (
         <AuthContext.Provider
           value={{
             logIn,
             logOut,
             registerUser,
             user,
           }}>
           {children}
         </AuthContext.Provider>
       );
     };

  One way to expose the above context value -- that is, our user and
  authentication actions -- to the descendant components is with a hook. Any
  descendant component can use this hook to access the enclosing AuthProvider's
  value.

  .. note::
     
     Because we provided ``null`` as the initial value when we created the
     AuthContext, if the component is **not** a descendant of an AuthProvider,
     the context value is ``null``.

  We define the ``useAuth`` hook as follows, then export the AuthProvider and
  ``useAuth`` hook so we can use them elsewhere in the app:

  .. code-block:: js

     // The useAuth hook can be used by components under an AuthProvider to access
     // the auth context value.
     const useAuth = () => {
       const auth = useContext(AuthContext);
       if (auth == null) {
         throw new Error('useAuth() called outside of a AuthProvider?');
       }
       return auth;
     };

     export {AuthProvider, useAuth};

---
title: Define the LogInView
ref: define-the-log-in-view
content: |

  We can use the actions of the AuthProvider in the login screen. Create
  the file ``LogInView.js`` and paste the following code that declares a UI
  with email and password inputs, an error message text box, a blue
  button that dynamically switches between "Login" or "Register,"
  depending on the auth mode, and a white button that allows users to
  toggle between the two modes.

  When the user presses the "Haven't created an account yet? Register"
  button, the auth mode switches to register. When the user presses the
  "Register" button in blue, we call ``registerUser()`` from the Auth Provider
  with the email and password text input values and we set the auth mode
  to login. 

  If a user has already registered, they can click the "Have an account
  already? Login" button toggling to the login auth mode. When the user
  presses the login button in blue, we pass the email and password text
  input values to the ``logIn()`` function from the AuthProvider.

  Notice how we use the ``useAuth`` hook to access the actions to be provided
  by the AuthProvider. For instance, when the user presses the login
  button, we pass the email and password text input values to the logIn
  function from the AuthProvider.

  .. code-block:: js
     :emphasize-lines: 11, 33, 35

     import React, {useState} from 'react';
     import {Button, Text, Input} from 'react-native-elements';
     import {useAuth} from './AuthProvider';

     // This view has an input for email and password and logs in the user when the
     // login button is pressed.
     export function LogInView() {
       const [email, setEmail] = useState('');
       const [password, setPassword] = useState('');
       const [error, setError] = useState();
       const {logIn, registerUser} = useAuth();
       const [authMode, setAuthMode] = useState('Login');

       return (
         <>
           <Text h3>{authMode}</Text>
           <Input
             autoCapitalize="none"
             placeholder="email"
             onChangeText={setEmail}
           />
           <Input
             secureTextEntry={true}
             placeholder="password"
             onChangeText={setPassword}
           />
           <Button
             onPress={async () => {
               console.log(`${authMode} button pressed with email ${email}`);
               setError(null);
               try {
                 if (authMode === 'Login') {
                   await logIn(email, password);
                 } else {
                   await registerUser(email, password);
                   setAuthMode('Login');
                 }
               } catch (e) {
                 setError(`Operation failed: ${e.message}`);
               }
             }}
             title={authMode}
           />
           <Text>{error}</Text>
           <ToggleAuthModeComponent setAuthMode={setAuthMode} authMode={authMode} />
         </>
       );
     }

     const ToggleAuthModeComponent = ({authMode, setAuthMode}) => {
       if (authMode === 'Login') {
         return (
           <Button
             title="Haven't created an account yet? Register"
             type="outline"
             onPress={async () => {
               setAuthMode('Register');
             }}
           />
         );
       } else {
         return (
           <Button
             title="Have an account already? Login"
             type="outline"
             onPress={async () => {
               setAuthMode('Login');
             }}
           />
         );
       }
     };

title: Update the App UI
ref: update-the-app-ui
content: |

  Now that we have defined the AuthProvider and a view that uses it, let's tie
  the two together. Open the ``App.js`` file, which ``react-native init``
  generated for you, and replace its entire contents with the following code
  block. Note how we can use the ``useAuth`` hook within the AppBody component
  to access the user and actions of its parent AuthProvider.

  .. code-block:: js
     :emphasize-lines: 10, 12, 20

     import React from 'react';
     import {SafeAreaView, View, StatusBar} from 'react-native';
     import {Button} from 'react-native-elements';
     import {useAuth} from './AuthProvider';
     import {LogInView} from './LogInView';
     import {AuthProvider} from './AuthProvider';

     const App = () => {
       return (
         <AuthProvider>
           <AppBody />
         </AuthProvider>
       );
     };

     // The AppBody is the main view within the App. If a user is not logged in, it
     // renders the login view. Otherwise, it renders the tasks view. It must be
     // within an AuthProvider.
     function AppBody() {
       const {user, logOut} = useAuth();
       return (
         <>
           <StatusBar barStyle="dark-content" />
           <SafeAreaView>
             <View>
               {user == null ? (
                 <LogInView />
               ) : (
                 <Button onPress={logOut} title="Log Out" />
               )}
             </View>
           </SafeAreaView>
         </>
       );
     }

     export default App;

  It would be a good idea to run the app now and ensure you can
  register, log in and log out.

  If everything is working correctly, your app should look something like this:

title: Define the Object Model Schemas
ref: define-the-object-model-schemas
content: |

  Now that we can log in with a user account, let's start working with data.
  First, we must define the data model. Create a file called ``schemas.js``
  and paste the following data model code in:

  .. code-block:: js

     import {ObjectId} from 'bson';

     class Task {
       constructor({
         name,
         partition,
         status = Task.STATUS_OPEN,
         id = new ObjectId(),
       }) {
         this._partition = partition;
         this._id = id;
         this.name = name;
         this.status = status;
       }

       static STATUS_OPEN = 'Open';
       static STATUS_IN_PROGRESS = 'InProgress';
       static STATUS_COMPLETE = 'Complete';
       static schema = {
         name: 'Task',
         properties: {
           _id: 'objectId',
           _partition: 'string?',
           name: 'string',
           status: 'string',
         },
         primaryKey: '_id',
       };
     }
     export {Task};

  You don't need to use a class when working with {+service-short+} in
  JavaScript, but we find it convenient. The Task class has a constructor to
  take care of setting defaults, such as the initial Task status and the ``_id``
  ObjectId property. It exposes some constants for possible status values and
  the schema that we will provide to the {+realm+}.

  We'll open the {+realm+} and use this model in another provider component
  we'll define next, the TasksProvider.

---
title: Implement the TasksProvider
ref: implement-the-tasks-provider
content: |

  In order to provide the data and actions related to fetching, creating,
  updating, and deleting Tasks to descendant components, we'll use the same
  Context, Provider and Hook pattern we used for the AuthProvider.

  In the AuthProvider component, we'll open a {+realm+}, fetch all Tasks in it,
  and watch that collection of Tasks for changes. We'll also define the
  following actions:

  - Create a Task
  - Update a Task's status
  - Delete a Task

  Create a new file called ``TasksProvider.js``. To begin, import everything we
  will need -- including the ``useAuth`` hook and ``Task`` class we defined
  earlier -- and create a Context object our TasksProvider can use:

  .. code-block:: js

     import React, {useContext, useState, useEffect, useRef} from 'react';
     import Realm from 'realm';
     import {useAuth} from './AuthProvider';
     import {Task} from './schemas';

     // Create the context that will be provided to descendants of TasksProvider via
     // the useTasks hook.
     const TasksContext = React.createContext(null);

  Now, begin defining the TasksProvider component. The component accepts two
  props: its children, of course, and a projectId to specify which subset of
  Tasks to work with.

  Use the ``useAuth`` hook to get the logged-in user and declare the state
  variable that will contain the list of Tasks. We also use the `useRef hook
  <https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useref>`__ to store a reference
  to our opened {+realm+}. We use ``useRef`` rather than ``useState`` for this
  because we don't care to re-render when the realm itself changes.

  .. code-block:: js

     const TasksProvider = ({children, projectId}) => {
       // Get the user from the AuthProvider context.
       const {user} = useAuth();

       // The tasks list will contain the tasks in the realm when opened.
       const [tasks, setTasks] = useState([]);

       // This realm does not need to be a state variable, because we don't re-render
       // on changing the realm.
       const realmRef = useRef(null);

  Next, still within the definition of TasksProvider, we use the `useEffect hook
  <https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useeffect>`__ to implement our
  logic for opening the {+realm+} and reading the Tasks. This effect callback
  runs whenever the user or projectId prop changes, including when the component
  first mounts.

  Within the callback, we define the configuration we'll use to open the
  {+realm+}. Notice we pass the user object from the authentication provider and
  use the projectId as the partition value in the ``sync`` field of the
  configuration. When opening a synced {+realm+} for a given partition value,
  {+service+} checks whether the user has permissions to read and/or write for
  that partition value. If the user is allowed to read with that partition
  value, the {+realm+} contains all Tasks with that partition value. Otherwise,
  the request to open fails.

  .. admonition:: Check the Logs Tab in the {+ui+}
     :class: note

     When working with {+sync+}, remember to check the :guilabel:`Logs` page in
     the {+ui+}. That page usually contains additional information that can help
     you troubleshoot any issues you may encounter.

  Upon successfully opening the {+realm+}, we read all Tasks from the {+realm+}
  and attach a change listener to the collection of Tasks. When the change
  listener fires -- due to a change to the Tasks -- we react by updating the
  tasks list state variable with the latest list of Tasks. This causes a
  re-render of all the child components, so they are essentially notified of the
  change to the Tasks.

  .. note::

     Replacing the entire list of Tasks whenever there is any change is great
     for an introduction to {+service+} or when you only have a small number of
     objects. But you may want to be more selective and nuanced with your
     updates when scaling your app to deal with larger sets of objects. That's
     out of scope for this tutorial.

  If the call to ``Realm.open()`` fails, we pass any errors to
  ``console.warn``.

  To finish off the effect callback, we return a cleanup function to be called
  the next time the effect is run or when the TasksComponent unmounts. This
  simply closes the {+realm+} if it is open.

  Everything should work at this point, but there's a slight issue. If this
  cleanup function runs before the request to asynchronously open the {+realm+}
  completes, it creates a race condition where the {+realm+} open success
  handler might try to update invalid state variables. Worse, since the cleanup
  function already ran, that newly-opened {+realm+} won't get cleaned up, which
  is a resource leak!

  We fix this with a simple ``canceled`` flag shared between the open success
  and cleanup callbacks. We set ``canceled`` to true in the cleanup callback. In
  the open success callback, we check that same flag. If it was set, we close
  the newly-opened {+realm+} and leave the function.

  .. code-block:: js
     :emphasize-lines: 19-20

       // The effect hook replaces lifecycle methods such as componentDidMount. In
       // this effect hook, we open the realm that contains the tasks and fetch a
       // collection of tasks.
       useEffect(() => {
         // Check that the user is logged in. You must authenticate to open a synced
         // realm.
         if (user == null) {
           console.warn('TasksView must be authenticated!');
           return;
         }

         // Define the configuration for the realm to use the Task schema. Base the
         // sync configuration on the user settings and use the project ID as the
         // partition value. This will open a realm that contains all objects where
         // object._partition == projectId.
         const config = {
           schema: [Task.schema],
           sync: {
             user,
             partitionValue: projectId,
           },
         }; 

         console.log(
           `Attempting to open Realm ${projectId} for user ${
             user.id
           } with config: ${JSON.stringify(config)}...`,
         ); 

         // Set this flag to true if the cleanup handler runs before the realm open
         // success handler, e.g. because the component unmounted.
         let canceled = false;

         // Now open the realm asynchronously with the given configuration.
         Realm.open(config)
           .then((openedRealm) => {
             // If this request has been canceled, we should close the realm.
             if (canceled) {
               openedRealm.close();
               return;
             }

             // Update the realmRef so we can use this opened realm for writing.
             realmRef.current = openedRealm;

             // Read the collection of all Tasks in the realm. Again, thanks to our
             // configuration above, the realm only contains tasks where
             // task._partition == projectId.
             const syncTasks = openedRealm.objects('Task');

             // Watch for changes to the tasks collection.
             openedRealm.addListener('change', () => {
               // On change, update the tasks state variable and re-render.
               setTasks([...syncTasks]);
             });

             // Set the tasks state variable and re-render.
             setTasks([...syncTasks]);
           })
           .catch((error) => console.warn('Failed to open realm:', error));

         // Return the cleanup function to be called when the component is unmounted.
         return () => {
           // Update the canceled flag shared between both this callback and the
           // realm open success callback above in case this runs first.
           canceled = true;

           // If there is an open realm, we must close it.
           const realm = realmRef.current;
           if (realm != null) {
             realm.removeAllListeners();
             realm.close();
             realmRef.current = null;
           }
         };
       }, [user, projectId]); // Declare dependencies list in the second parameter to useEffect().

  Continuing in the TasksProvider function definition, let's define the create,
  update, and delete actions. Each function opens a write transaction on the
  {+realm+} in order to modify its data. Again, we use the Task class we defined
  earlier.

  .. code-block:: js
     :emphasize-lines: 7-13, 31-33, 39-41

       // Define our create, update, and delete functions that users of the
       // useTasks() hook can call.
       const createTask = (newTaskName) => {
         const realm = realmRef.current;

         // Open a write transaction.
         realm.write(() => {
           // Create a new task in the same partition -- that is, in the same project.
           realm.create(
             'Task',
             new Task({name: newTaskName || 'New Task', partition: projectId}),
           );
         });
       };

       // Define the function for updating a task's status.
       const setTaskStatus = (task, status) => {
         // One advantage of centralizing the realm functionality in this provider is
         // that we can check to make sure a valid status was passed in here.
         if (
           ![
             Task.STATUS_OPEN,
             Task.STATUS_IN_PROGRESS,
             Task.STATUS_COMPLETE,
           ].includes(status)
         ) {
           throw new Error(`Invalid Status ${status}`);
         }
         const realm = realmRef.current;

         realm.write(() => {
           task.status = status;
         });
       };

       // Define the function for deleting a task.
       const deleteTask = (task) => {
         const realm = realmRef.current;
         realm.write(() => {
           realm.delete(task);
         });
       };

  At the end of the definition for TasksProvider, we provide the actions we just
  defined and the list of Tasks as the value of the TasksContext, similarly to
  how we provided the data and actions in the AuthProvider:

  .. code-block:: js
     :emphasize-lines: 6-12

       // Render the children within the TaskContext's provider. The value contains
       // everything that should be made available to descendants that use the
       // useTasks hook.
       return (
         <TasksContext.Provider
           value={{
             createTask,
             deleteTask,
             setTaskStatus,
             tasks,
             projectId,
           }}>
           {children}
         </TasksContext.Provider>
       );
     };

  Finally, define the ``useTasks`` hook that provides descendants of a
  TasksProvider access to those Tasks and related actions, and export both the
  TasksProvider and the ``useTasks`` hook so we can use them elsewhere in the
  app:

  .. code-block:: js

     // The useTasks hook can be used by any descendant of the TasksProvider. It
     // provides the tasks of the TasksProvider's project and various functions to
     // create, update, and delete the tasks in that project.
     const useTasks = () => {
       const value = useContext(TasksContext);
       if (value == null) {
         throw new Error('useTasks() called outside of a TasksProvider?');
       }
       return value;
     };

     export {TasksProvider, useTasks};

title: Implement the TaskItem
ref: implement-the-tasks-item
content: |

  We just need to a UI to display the Tasks and allow the user to use the
  actions we defined in the TasksProvider.

  To represent Tasks in a list, let's define the TaskItem component. When
  rendered as a descendant of the TasksProvider we just defined, it can use the
  ``useTasks`` hook to access the Task-related actions. We'll present buttons to
  execute these actions in a generic helper component called ActionSheet. Once
  again, we'll base some of these views on the React Native Elements toolkit. In
  the finished app, it will look something like this:

  .. figure:: /images/tutorial-react-native-task-actions.png
     :alt: TaskItems rendered with the ActionSheet overlay
     :width: 300px
     :lightbox:

  Create a new file called ``TaskItem.js`` and paste the following code. Notice
  everywhere that we use the actions from the TasksProvider:

  .. code-block:: js
     :emphasize-lines: 42, 64, 72, 80 

     import React, {useState} from 'react';
     import {Text, ListItem, Overlay} from 'react-native-elements';
     import {Task} from './schemas';
     import {useTasks} from './TasksProvider';

     // Action sheet contains a list of actions. Each action should have a `title`
     // string and `action` function property. A "Cancel" action is automatically
     // added to the end of your list of actions. You must also provide the
     // closeOverlay function that this component will call to request that the
     // action sheet be closed.
     function ActionSheet({actions, visible, closeOverlay}) {
       const cancelAction = {
         title: 'Cancel',
         action: closeOverlay,
       };
       return (
         <Overlay
           overlayStyle={{width: '90%'}}
           isVisible={visible}
           onBackdropPress={closeOverlay}>
           <>
             {[...actions, cancelAction].map(({title, action}) => (
               <ListItem
                 key={title}
                 title={title}
                 onPress={() => {
                   closeOverlay();
                   action();
                 }}
               />
             ))}
           </>
         </Overlay>
       );
     }

     // The TaskItem represents a Task in a list. When you click an item in the list,
     // an action sheet appears. The action sheet contains a list of actions the user
     // can perform on the task, namely deleting and changing its status.
     export function TaskItem({task}) {
       // Pull the task actions from the TasksProvider.
       const {deleteTask, setTaskStatus} = useTasks();

       // The action sheet appears when the user presses an item in the list.
       const [actionSheetVisible, setActionSheetVisible] = useState(false);

       // Specify the list of available actions in the action list when the user
       // presses an item in the list.
       const actions = [
         {
           title: 'Delete',
           action: () => {
             deleteTask(task);
           },
         },
       ];

       // For each possible status other than the current status, make an action to
       // move the task into that status. Rather than creating a generic method to
       // avoid repetition, we split each status to separate each case in the code
       // below for demonstration purposes.
       if (task.status !== Task.STATUS_OPEN) {
         actions.push({
           title: 'Mark Open',
           action: () => {
             setTaskStatus(task, Task.STATUS_OPEN);
           },
         });
       }
       if (task.status !== Task.STATUS_IN_PROGRESS) {
         actions.push({
           title: 'Mark In Progress',
           action: () => {
             setTaskStatus(task, Task.STATUS_IN_PROGRESS);
           },
         });
       }
       if (task.status !== Task.STATUS_COMPLETE) {
         actions.push({
           title: 'Mark Complete',
           action: () => {
             setTaskStatus(task, Task.STATUS_COMPLETE);
           },
         });
       }

       return (
         <>
           <ActionSheet
             visible={actionSheetVisible}
             closeOverlay={() => setActionSheetVisible(false)}
             actions={actions}
           />
           <ListItem
             key={task.id}
             onPress={() => {
               setActionSheetVisible(true);
             }}
             title={task.name}
             bottomDivider
             checkmark={
               task.status === Task.STATUS_COMPLETE ? (
                 <Text>&#10004; {/* checkmark */}</Text>
               ) : task.status === Task.STATUS_IN_PROGRESS ? (
                 <Text>In Progress</Text>
               ) : null
             }
           />
         </>
       );
     }

title: Implement the AddTaskView
ref: implement-the-add-task-view
content: |

  To add a Task, the user can press a button and enter the new Task name into a
  prompt. Let's define this functionality in a new component called AddTaskView.

  Create a new file called ``AddTaskView.js`` and paste the following code in.
  Notice where we use the createTask action from the TasksProvider we defined earlier:

  .. code-block:: js
     :emphasize-lines: 12, 29

     import React, {useState} from 'react';
     import {Overlay, Input, Button} from 'react-native-elements';
     import {useTasks} from './TasksProvider';

     // The AddTaskView is a button for adding tasks. When the button is pressed, an
     // overlay shows up to request user input for the new task name. When the
     // "Create" button on the overlay is pressed, the overlay closes and the new
     // task is created in the realm.
     export function AddTaskView() {
       const [overlayVisible, setOverlayVisible] = useState(false);
       const [newTaskName, setNewTaskName] = useState('');
       const {createTask} = useTasks();
       return (
         <>
           <Overlay
             isVisible={overlayVisible}
             overlayStyle={{width: '90%'}}
             onBackdropPress={() => setOverlayVisible(false)}>
             <>
               <Input
                 placeholder="New Task Name"
                 onChangeText={(text) => setNewTaskName(text)}
                 autoFocus={true}
               />
               <Button
                 title="Create"
                 onPress={() => {
                   setOverlayVisible(false);
                   createTask(newTaskName);
                 }}
               />
             </>
           </Overlay>
           <Button
             type="outline"
             title="Add Task"
             onPress={() => {
               setOverlayVisible(true);
             }}
           />
         </>
       );
     }

title: Implement the TasksView
ref: implement-the-tasks-view
content: |

  We present the Task items in a list and expose the Add Task functionality a
  new component called TasksView.

  Create the file ``TasksView.js`` and paste the following code in. We use the
  ``useTasks`` hook to access the list of tasks and create a TaskItem for each
  Task in that list. We also place the AddTaskView at the top of the view, next
  to a logout button.

  .. code-block:: js
     :emphasize-lines: 16, 22, 27

     import React from 'react';
     import {View, ScrollView} from 'react-native';
     import {Text, Button} from 'react-native-elements';
     import {useAuth} from './AuthProvider';
     import {useTasks} from './TasksProvider';
     import {TaskItem} from './TaskItem';
     import {AddTaskView} from './AddTaskView';

     // The Tasks View displays the list of tasks of the parent TasksProvider.
     // It has a button to log out and a button to add a new task.
     export function TasksView() {
       // Get the logOut function from the useAuth hook.
       const {logOut} = useAuth();

       // Get the list of tasks and the projectId from the useTasks hook.
       const {tasks, projectId} = useTasks();

       return (
         <>
           <View style={{flexDirection: 'row', justifyContent: 'space-between'}}>
             <Button type="outline" title="Log Out" onPress={logOut} />
             <AddTaskView />
           </View>
           <Text h2>{projectId}</Text>
           <ScrollView>
             {tasks.map(task => (
               <TaskItem key={`${task._id}`} task={task} />
             ))}
           </ScrollView>
         </>
       );
     }

title: Tie It All Together
ref: tie-it-all-together
content: |

  At last, we can tie the authentication and tasks together. Open ``App.js``
  again and import the new components by adding the following lines near the top
  of the file:

  .. code-block:: js

     import {TasksProvider} from './TasksProvider';
     import {TasksView} from './TasksView';

  Update the AppBody component to use the TasksProviders and TasksView when a
  user is logged in. We hardcode the projectId to "My Project" for now. In a
  future tutorial, we will implement Projects, which will allow us to enable
  more complex permissions and collaboration features.

  .. code-block:: js
     :emphasize-lines: 11-13

     function AppBody() {
       const {user} = useAuth();
       return (
         <>
           <StatusBar barStyle="dark-content" />
           <SafeAreaView>
             <View>
               {user == null ? (
                 <LogInView />
               ) : (
                 <TasksProvider projectId="My Project">
                   <TasksView />
                 </TasksProvider>
               )}
             </View>
           </SafeAreaView>
         </>
       );
     }

  Here's how this should look:

title: Run the App
ref: run-the-app-2
content: |

  Run your app and verify that you can log in and view, create, update, and
  delete Tasks.

  Run the app in another simulator and edit Tasks simultaneously to see {+sync+}
  in action! When you make a change on one simulator, it should automatically
  update on the other. For example, try adding a Task, changing its status, and
  deleting a Task on one simulator. If everything is working correctly, the app
  on the other simulator will automatically reflect the changes you make in real
  time.

  Congratulations! You have completed the first {+realm+} React Native tutorial.
  How did it go? Please leave feedback using the feedback widget on the bottom
  right of the page.

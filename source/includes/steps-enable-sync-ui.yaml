title: Decide Whether to Use Development Mode
ref: decide-whether-to-use-development-mode
content: |
  The Sync panel presents you with two tabs: :guilabel:`Configuration` and
  :guilabel:`Development Mode`. The tab that you should select depends on whether you want
  to define your object models in client-side code or prefer to use a server-side configuration.

  Select the :guilabel:`Configuration` tab if you want {+backend-short+} to
  generate the client-side object model code for you based on your :ref:`schemas
  <mongodb-schemas>`. {+backend+} can :ref:`generate schemas for you
  <create-rom-from-schema>` based on data already in your cluster, or you can
  define them yourself.

  Select the :guilabel:`Development Mode` tab if you would rather define and
  modify your object model in client-side code.
---
title: Configure Sync
ref: configure-sync
content: |
  Follow the instructions in the {+ui+} to configure sync for your cluster.

  1. **Select a Cluster to Sync:** {+sync+} applies to the entire cluster. Specify which cluster you want to sync in the dropdown.
  #. **Define a Database Name (Development Mode Tab Only):** If you opted to use Development Mode, {+service-short+} needs to know which database in your cluster to use for new collections it creates for {+sync-short+}. Specify that database name in the input field.
  #. **Choose a Partition Key:** Specify which field to use to determine which {+realm+} each object belongs to. See :ref:`Partition Atlas Data into Realms <partitioning>`.
  #. **Define Permissions (Configuration Tab Only):** Select a template from the dropdown or enter your read and write :ref:`sync rule <sync-rules>` in the input boxes.

ref: sync-data-from-a-client

  Now that you have enabled {+sync+}, you can open a synced {+realm+} using a
  client SDK to read and write synced data. See the client guide for your SDK:

  - :ref:`Sync Data on Android <android-sync-data>`
  - :ref:`Sync Data on iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS <ios-sync-data>`
  - :ref:`Sync Data on Node.js <node-sync-data>`
  - :ref:`Sync Data with React Native <react-native-sync-data>`

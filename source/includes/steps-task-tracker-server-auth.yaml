     Once you've finished building the application, consider modifying the app
     to require new users to confirm their accounts before they log in. To learn
     how, check out the docs for :ref:`user confirmation
     <email-password-authentication-confirmation>`.

title: Configure Password Resets
ref: configure-password-resets
content: |
  For the :guilabel:`Password Reset Method`, select :guilabel:`Run a password
  reset function`. This method enables an SDK method that calls a Realm Function
  to handle the password reset. In this tutorial we won't worry about password
  resets, so you can use the default password reset function, ``resetFunc``,
  which denies all password reset requests.

title: Add NPM as a Scoped Registry
ref: download-the-latest-realm
content: |

  Before you can download and use {+service+} within your Unity project, you
  must add :npm:`NPM <>` as a `scoped registry
  <https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-scoped.html>`_. Adding NPM as a scoped
  registry configures Unity to communicate with NPM, allowing you to install
  packages, such as {+service-short+}.

  Open the `Unity package manager
  <https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui.html>`_ by clicking the
  :guilabel:`Window` tab on the top of the Unity menu. Click :guilabel:`Package
  Manager` from the :guilabel:`Window dropdown`. Then, click the gear icon on
  the right-hand corner. Select the :guilabel:`Advanced Project
  Settings` option from the dropdown.

  Fill out the scoped registry form with the details below and click the save
  button.

  .. code-block:: none

   name = NPM
   URL = https://registry.npmjs.org
   Scope(s) = io.realm.unity

title: Add Realm to the Project Manifest
ref: add-realm-project-manifest

  Now that Unity can install the {+service-short+} .NET SDK from NPM, you need
  to add {+service-short+} as a dependency in your  project's `manifest file
  <https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-manifestPrj.html>`_. Open
  "Packages/manifest.json" file in `Visual Studio
  <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/>`_ or another text editor. At
  the bottom of the dependency's object, add the field, "io.realm.unity" and
  its value, the {+service-short+} .NET version number you want to use in
  quotes.

  .. code-block:: none

   "io.realm.unity": "<version-number>"

  Remember to replace the ``<version-number>`` above with the actual version
  number. Your full manifest file should look something like the following:

  .. code-block:: none

   {
    "dependencies": {
      ...
      "io.realm.unity": "10.2.1"
    },
    "scopedRegistries": [
      {
        "name": "NPM",
        "url": "https://registry.npmjs.org/",
        "scopes": [
          "io.realm.unity"
        ]
      }
    ]
   }
   
  When you save this file, Unity downloads the specified version of the
  {+service-short+} .NET SDK package from the NPM registry.

  To verify that the {+service-short+} package has been downloaded from NPM,
  open your Unity package manager by clicking the :guilabel:`Window` tab on the
  top of the Unity menu. Click :guilabel:`Package Manager` from the
  :guilabel:`Window` dropdown. You should see {+service-short+} on the :guilabel:`"Packages: In
  Project"` tab.

  If you see a green check icon next to the version number of the
  {+service-short+} package, that means your package is up-to-date. However, if
  you see the up arrow icon, a new version of the package is available. Clicking
  it gives you the option to upgrade to the latest release.

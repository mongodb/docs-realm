title: Add NPM as a Scoped Registry
ref: download-the-latest-realm
content: |

  Before you can download and use {+service+} within your Unity project, you
  must add :npm:`NPM <>` as a `scoped registry
  <https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-scoped.html>`_. Adding NPM as a scoped
  registry configures Unity to communicate with NPM allowing you to install
  packages, such as {+service-short+} from it.

  Open the `Unity package manager
  <https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui.html>`_ by clicking the
  :guilabel:`Window` tab on the top of the Unity menu. Click :guilabel:`Package
  Manager` from the :guilabel:`Window dropdown`. Then, click the gear icon on
  the right hand corner. Select the :guilabel:`Advanced Project
  Settings` option from the dropdown.

  Fill out the scoped registry form with the details below and click the save
  button.

  .. code-block:: none

   name = NPM
   URL = https://registry.npmjs.org
   Scope(s) = io.realm.unity

  Now that Unity has the ability to install the {+service-short+} .NET SDK from
  NPM, you need to add {+service-short+} as a dependency in your
  your project's `manifest file
  <https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-manifestPrj.html>`_. Open
  "Packages/manifest.json" file in `Visual Studio
  <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/>`_ or another text editor. At
  the bottom of the dependency's object, add the field, "io.realm.unity" and
  it's value, the {+service-short+} .NET version number you want to use in quotes.

  .. code-block:: none

   "io.realm.unity": "<version-number>"

  Remember to replace the version-number above with the actual version number.
  When you save this file, Unity will download the specified version of the
  {+service-short+} .NET SDK package from the NPM registry.

  `Create a C# script
  <https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CreatingAndUsingScripts.html>`_ or use a C#
  script you have already created. Open that script in `Visual Studio
  <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/>`_ or another text editor. Add
  the following line to import your {+service-short+} package: 

  .. code-block:: csharp

   using Realms;

     Before you begin using {+service+} within your Unity project, you must
  download the {+service-short+} .NET SDK. 

  Navigate to the :github:`realm-dotnet repository releases
  <realm/realm-dotnet/releases>` page, and scroll down to the release you want
  to use in your project. If you are unsure of which release to use, you can use
  the one labeled **"latest release"** on the left row.

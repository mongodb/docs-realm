  Once you have converted the collection to Advanced Mode you can edit
  the underlying configuration document. Collection rule configuration
  documents have the following form:

  .. code-block:: json
     
     {
       "roles": [
         <Role Configuration>,
         ...
       ],
       "filters": [
         <Filter Configuration>,
         ...
       ],
       "schema": {
         "properties": {
           "<Field Name>": <Schema Document>,
           ...
         }
       }
     }

  .. list-table::
    :widths: 30 70
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Field
      - Description

    * - ``roles``
      - An array of :ref:`Query Role configuration documents <query-role-config>` that each define a single role's :guilabel:`Apply When` condition and associated CRUD permissions.
      
        .. important::
            
            {+service-short+} evaluates roles for each query in the order that
            they're defined. Ensure that each role configuration
            document's array index matches its desired position in the
            evaluation order.

    * - ``filters``
      - An array of :ref:`Query Filter configuration documents <query-filter-config>` that each define a filter on the collection.
      
    * - ``schema``
      - A :ref:`Document Schema <document-schema-config>` that configures the shape and contents of all documents in the collection.

        .. note::
            
            The root of all collection schemas must be an :ref:`object
            schema document <schema-type-objects>`. You can embed other
            :ref:`schema types <schema-types>` inside the ``properties``
            field of the root schema.

  :guilabel:`Save`. {+service+} will immediately begin using the new rule
  configuration you defined for all incoming queries on the collection.

  You can create and manage query filters from the MongoDB rules screen
  in the Realm UI. To get to the rules screen, click :guilabel:`Rules`
  beneath :guilabel:`MongoDB Clusters` in the left-hand navigation.

ref: create-a-new-filter
level: 4

  the :guilabel:`Rules` menu then click the :guilabel:`Filters` tab.
  Click :guilabel:`New Filter` and enter a :guilabel:`Name` for the new

title: Specify the Apply When Expression
ref: specify-the-apply-when-expression
level: 4
content: |
  In the :guilabel:`Apply When` input box, enter a :doc:`JSON expression
  </services/json-expressions>` that defines when the filter applies to
  a query. If the expression evaluates to ``true`` for an incoming
  query, Realm adds the :guilabel:`Filter Query` parameters to the
  incoming query.

title: Specify the Filter Query Predicates
ref: specify-the-filter-query-predicates
level: 4
content: |
  In the :guilabel:`Query` input box, specify a document that contains
  additional query predicates to merge into the incoming query when the
  filter applies. For example, a filter that withholds documents that
  have a ``score`` below ``20`` could use the following filter query:

  .. code-block:: shell

     { "score": { "$gt": 20 } }

title: Specify the Filter Projection
ref: specify-the-filter-projection
level: 4
content: |
  In the :guilabel:`Projection` input box, specify a document that
  contains a :manual:`projection
  </tutorial/project-fields-from-query-results>` document to merge into
  the incoming query when the filter applies.

  For example, a filter that withholds the ``career_stats`` and
  ``personal`` fields from documents could use the following filter
  projection:

  .. code-block:: shell

     {
       "career_stats": 0,
       "personal": 0
     }
     
  .. cssclass:: bordered-figure
  .. figure:: /images/mongodb-filters-projection.png

ref: save-the-filter
level: 4
content: |
  After you have configured the :guilabel:`Filter Query` and the
  :guilabel:`Apply When` expression, click :guilabel:`Save`. After
  saving, Realm immediately begins evaluating and applying filters to
  incoming queries on the collection.

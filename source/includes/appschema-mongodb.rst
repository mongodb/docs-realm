Every :doc:`MongoDB Atlas data source </mongodb/link-a-data-source>`
linked to your app is configured as a service in the ``/services``
directory. Each data source maps to its own sub-directory with the same
name as the service.

The primary service configuration for a MongoDB Atlas data source is
``config.json``, which defines connection parameters and sync rules.

If the data source is not a :doc:`synced cluster </sync>` or :ref:`Data
Lake <data-lake-caveats>`, then you can define collection-level rules in
the ``/rules`` sub-directory.

.. important::

   MongoDB Service names are not necessarily the same as their linked
   data source's name in Atlas. You define the service name for a data
   source when you link it to your application. For linked clusters, the
   default MongoDB service name is ``mongodb-atlas``. For linked Data
   Lakes, the default service name is ``mongodb-datalake``.

Synced Cluster Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``config.sync`` field of ``config.json`` determines if a cluster is
:doc:`synced </sync>` and, if it is, defines the rules for sync operations on
the cluster.

   * - Field
     - Description
   
   * - | ``sync.state``
       | Boolean
     - If ``true``, :doc:`Sync </sync>` is enabled for the cluster, which means
       that client applications can sync data in the cluster with Realm Database
       and that :ref:`non-sync collection rules <mongodb-service-rules>` do not
       apply.
   
   * - | ``sync.development_mode_enabled``
       | Boolean
     - If ``true``, :term:`development mode` is enabled for the cluster. While
       enabled, Realm does not enforce sync rules, stores synced objects in a
       specific database within the cluster, and mirrors object types in that
       database's collection schemas.

   * - | ``sync.database_name``
       | String
     - The name of the database in the synced cluster where Realm should store
       synced objects.
       
       When :term:`development mode` is enabled, Realm stores synced objects in
       this database. Each object type maps to its own collection in the
       database with a schema that matches the synced objects.
   
   * - | ``sync.partition.key``
       | String
     - The name of the field that :ref:`partitions <partitioning>` data into
       client Realms.
   
   * - | ``sync.partition.type``
       | String
     - The type of the partition key field value.
   
   * - | ``sync.partition.permissions``
       | Document
     - A document that defines the ``read`` and ``write`` permissions for the
       synced cluster. Permissions are defined with :ref:`rule expressions
       <expressions>` that Realm evaluates per-user, per-partition. The
       expressions have access to the :json-expansion:`%%user` and
       :json-expansion:`%%partition` expansions.

.. _mongodb-service-rules:

MongoDB Collection Rules (Non-Sync)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For non-synced clusters, you can define collection-level rules that Realm
evaluates dynamically for each request. Each collection's rules are stored in
the ``/rules`` sub-directory in a JSON file with the same name as the collection
namespace.

   }

   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - | ``id``
       | String
     - A string that uniquely identifies the trigger. {+service-short+}
       automatically generates a unique ID for a trigger when you create
       it.

   * - | ``database``
       | String
     - The name of the database that holds the collection.

   * - | ``collection``
       | String
     - The name of the collection.

   * - | ``roles``
       | Array<Document>
     - An array of :ref:`Query Role configuration documents
       <query-role-config>`, which have the following form:
       
       .. include:: /mongodb/tables/query-role-configuration.rst

   * - | ``schema``
       | Document
     - A :ref:`Document Schema <document-schema-config>`. The root level
       schema must be an :ref:`object schema <schema-type-objects>`,
       which has the following form:

       .. code-block:: json

           When you call {+cli-bin+} from the command line, your
           shell searches each directory listed in your ``PATH``
           `environment variable
           <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable>`_ for the
           {+cli-bin+} executable binary.

           Move the {+cli-bin+} binary file from your downloads
           folder to a directory listed in your ``PATH``.

           .. code-block:: shell

              mv /path/to/downloads/realm-cli /usr/local/bin/realm-cli

           You can check which directories are listed in your ``PATH``
           by running the following from the command line:

           .. code-block:: shell

              echo $PATH

           To add a directory to your path, add the following to the
           bottom of your shell ``rc`` file (e.g. ``~/.bashrc``),
           substituting in the path of the directory you'd like to add:

           .. code-block:: shell

              export PATH=${PATH}:path/to/directory

       - id: windows
         name: Windows
         content: |
           When you call ``realm-cli.exe`` from the command line, your
           system searches each directory listed in your ``%PATH%``
           `environment variable
           <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable>`_ for
           the {+cli-bin+} executable file.

           Move ``realm-cli.exe`` to a directory that is listed
           in ``%PATH%``.

           You can check which directories are listed in ``%PATH%`` as
           well as add new directories from the :guilabel:`Environment
           Variables` configuration window. You can find this window by
           searching for *"Environment Variables"* or by following these
           steps:

           1. Depending on which version of Windows you're running,
              right click :guilabel:`My Computer` or :guilabel:`This PC`
              and select :guilabel:`Properties`.

           2. Click :guilabel:`Advanced Properties`, then
              :guilabel:`Environment Variables`.

           In the :guilabel:`Environment Variables` window, your ``PATH``
           variable is listed under :guilabel:`System Variables`.

title: (Linux / macOS) Configure execution permissions for {+cli-bin+}
ref: configure-execution-permissions
content: |
  On Linux and Mac systems, no user has execution permissions for
  {+cli-bin+} by default. To add execution permissions, run the
  following command:

  .. code-block:: shell

     chmod +x path/to/realm-cli

  To confirm that {+cli-bin+} has execution permissions, navigate to
  the directory containing the binary and run the following command:

  .. code-block:: shell

     ls -l | grep "realm-cli"

  The output of this command should resemble the following:

  .. code-block:: shell
     :copyable: False

     -rwxrwxr-x@  1 user  staff      9443152 Mar  6 12:01 realm-cli

  The ``ls -l`` command lists the file's permissions followed by some
  additional information. If the permissions string in your output
  includes the letter ``x`` then you have successfully configured
  execution permissions. If no ``x`` is present (e.g. ``-rw-r--r--@``)
  you did not successfully configure execution permissions and should
  run the ``chmod`` command as described above.

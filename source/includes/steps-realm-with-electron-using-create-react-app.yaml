  {+service+} automatically attempts to resume any suspended triggers included 
  in an imported :ref:`application directory <application-directory>`. 
  To begin restarting a suspended trigger,
  :doc:`export </deploy/export-realm-app>` a copy of your
  application from the :guilabel:`Export` tab of the
  :guilabel:`Settings` page in the {+ui+}, or by running the
  following command from an authenticated instance of :doc:`realm-cli
  </deploy/realm-cli-reference>`:

  .. code-block:: shell

     realm-cli export --app-id=<App ID>.

title: Verify that the Trigger Configuration File Exists
ref: verify-that-the-trigger-configuration-file-exists
content: |
  If you exported a new copy of your application, it should already
  include an up-to-date configuration file for the suspended trigger.
  You can confirm that the configuration file exists by looking in the
  ``/triggers`` directory for a :ref:`trigger configuration file
  <appschema-triggers>` with the same name as the trigger.

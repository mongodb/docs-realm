title: Create Your React Application
ref: create-your-react-application
content: |
  Scaffold your application by using the `Create React App
  <https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html>`_ toolchain.
  Enter the following command into your terminal:

  .. code-block:: shell

     npx create-react-app my_electron_react_application

title: Install CRACO to Alter Your Webpack Configuration
ref: install-craco
content: |
  To allow your application to work properly with electron you have to
  alter your webpack configuration. By default, applications created via
  create-react-app use a webpack file that is preconfigured and hidden
  to the end user. Using CRACO you can override these default
  configurated values. Install CRACO with the following command:

  .. code-block:: shell

     npm install @craco/craco

---
title: Create a CRACO Configuration File
ref: create-craco-config
content: |
  In order to override the preconfigured webpack values, create a CRACO
  config file called ``craco.config.js`` at the root of your
  application. Add the following to this file:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     const nodeExternals = require("webpack-node-externals");

     module.exports = {
       webpack: {
         configure: {
           target: "electron-renderer",
           externals: [
             nodeExternals({
              allowlist: [/webpack(\/.*)?/, "electron-devtools-installer"],
             }),
           ],
         },
       },
     };

  Note that the `target <https://webpack.js.org/configuration/target/>`_
  is set to "electron-renderer" to compile your application for browser
  environments for Electron built-in modules. ``nodeExternals`` is also
  specified to prevent all node_modules from being bundled. The
  ``allowList`` key in the object passed  in to ``nodeExternals``
  specifies a list of modules to include in the bundle. Here, webpack
  and the electron-devtools and included in the bundle. In order to make
  use of webpack-node-externals, run the following command:

  .. code-block:: shell

     npm install webpack-node-externals --save-dev

---
title: Install Electron
ref: install-electron
content: |
  Install electron as a devDependency in order to run your application
  from a chromium desktop window using Electron. Run the following
  command:

  .. code-block:: shell

     npm install electron --save-dev

---
title: Create Your Electron Main Process File
ref: create-your-electron-main-process
content: |
  The electron ``main process`` file can be thought of as the entry
  point into your application. This file is responsible for loading your
  React App's ``index.html`` file into the ``BrowserWindow`` created by
  electron.

  .. note::
     Each electron application can only have one ``main process``. The
     main process can create web pages, and each web page runs in it's
     own process, known as the ``renderer process``. To learn more about
     this read the official `Electron Application
     Architecture <https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/application-architecture>`_
     doc.

  Add the following code to a new file called ``electron.js`` in the
  ``public`` directory:

  .. code-block:: javascript

     const electron = require("electron");
     const path = require("path");

     const app = electron.app;
     const BrowserWindow = electron.BrowserWindow;

     let mainWindow;

     function createWindow() {
       // Create the browser window.
       mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
         width: 800,
         height: 600,
         webPreferences: { nodeIntegration: true },
       });
       // and load the index.html of the app.
       console.log(__dirname);
       mainWindow.loadFile(path.join(__dirname, "../build/index.html"));
     }

     // This method will be called when Electron has finished
     // initialization and is ready to create browser windows.
     // Some APIs can only be used after this event occurs.
     app.on("ready", createWindow);

title: Run Your Application
ref: run-your-app
content: |
  In order to run your application, specify a homepage and a main entry point for electron by adding the following to your ``package.json`` file: 

  .. code-block:: shell

     "main": "public/electron.js",
     "homepage": "./",

  Finally, add the following scripts to your ``package.json`` file:

  .. code-block:: shell

     "scripts": {
       "build": "craco build",
       "start": "electron ."
     },

  In your terminal, run ``npm run build`` in one tab and ``npm run
  start`` in another tab. You should see the following:

  .. cssclass:: bordered-figure
  .. figure:: /images/electron-cra.png
    :alt: Electron Desktop App with React

title: Install Realm
ref: install-realm
content: |
  In your terminal use the following command to add Realm to your project:

  .. code-block:: shell

     npm install realm@beta

  You can now begin using realm in either the renderer processes or the
  main process. 

  Use realm in the renderer process by adding the following to the top
  of the ``src/App.js`` file (you will also need to import it in whichever
  file you write code using Realm in):

  .. code-block:: shell

     import Realm from "realm";

  Use realm in the main process by adding the following to the top of the ``public/electron.js`` file (you will also need to require it in whichever file you write code using Realm in):

  .. code-block:: shell

     const Realm = require("realm");

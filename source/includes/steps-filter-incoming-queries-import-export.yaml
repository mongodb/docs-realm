title: Export Your Realm Application
ref: export-your-application
content: |
  To define query filters with :doc:`realm-cli
  </deploy/realm-cli-reference>` you need to export an
  :ref:`application directory <application-directory>` for your
  application.
  You can :doc:`export </deploy/export-realm-app>` your
  application from the :guilabel:`Export` tab of the
  :guilabel:`Settings` page in the Realm UI, or by running the
  following command from an authenticated instance of :doc:`realm-cli
  </deploy/realm-cli-reference>`:

  .. code-block:: shell

     realm-cli export --app-id=<App ID>

title: Add a Rule Configuration File
ref: add-a-rule-configuration-file
content: |
  The ``rules`` subdirectory of the :doc:`linked cluster
  </mongodb/link-a-cluster>`'s service directory configures the rules
  for a MongoDB collection. The rules configuration file is a JSON file
  with the same name as the collection namespace. For example, the file
  ``/services/mongodb-atlas/rules/app.users.json`` defines the rules for
  the collection ``app.users`` in the ``mongodb-atlas`` cluster. If you
  have not configured rules for the collection, add a configuration file
  for it to the ``rules`` directory:

  .. code-block:: shell

     touch services/<cluster name>/rules/<db>.<collection>.json

  The configuration file should have the following general form:

  .. code-block:: shell

     {
       "roles": [],
       "filters": [],
       "schema": {}
     }

  .. note::
     This guide focuses on creating ``filters`` for the collection.
     Check out the other configuration guides to learn how to
     :doc:`define roles and permissions
     </mongodb/define-roles-and-permissions>` and :doc:`enforce document
     schemas </mongodb/enforce-a-document-schema>`.

title: Add One or More Filters
ref: add-one-or-more-filters
content: |
  Add a document to the ``filters`` array for each filter that you want
  to configure. Filter documents have the following form:

  .. include:: /mongodb/tables/query-filter-params.rst

---
title: Import Your Application Directory
ref: import-your-application-directory
content: |
  Once you've added the filter configurations to the collection rule
  configuration file, all that's left is to import the rule.
  Save the rule configuration file then navigate to the
  root of the exported application directory. Log in to MongoDB Atlas
  with ``realm-cli``:

  .. code-block:: shell

     realm-cli login --api-key=<my api key> --private-api-key=<my private api key>

  After logging in, import the directory:

  .. code-block:: shell

     realm-cli import
     
  Once the import completes, Realm will immediately begin evaluating
  and applying the filters to incoming queries on the collection.

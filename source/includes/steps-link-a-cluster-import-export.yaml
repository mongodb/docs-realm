title: Export Your Realm Application
ref: export-your-application
content: |
  To link a MongoDB Atlas cluster to your {+app+} with
  :doc:`realm-cli </deploy/realm-cli-reference>`, you need a
  previously created :ref:`application configuration <application-directory>`.
  You can :doc:`export your application
  </deploy/export-realm-app>` configuration from the :guilabel:`Export`
  tab of the :guilabel:`Settings` page in the {+ui+}, or by running the
  following command from an authenticated instance of :doc:`realm-cli
  </deploy/realm-cli-reference>`:

  .. code-block:: shell

     realm-cli export --app-id=<App ID>

title: Create a MongoDB Service Configuration Directory
ref: create-a-mongodb-service-configuration-directory
content: |
  Create a new subdirectory in the ``/services`` folder of the
  application directory that you exported. The name of the subdirectory
  should match the name of the MongoDB service you're creating.

  .. code-block:: shell

     mkdir -p services/<MongoDB Service Name>

---
title: Add a MongoDB Service Configuration File
ref: add-a-mongodb-service-configuration-file
content: |
  Add a file named ``config.json`` to the new service directory. The
  configuration file should have the following form:

  .. code-block:: shell

     {
       "type": "mongodb-atlas",
       "name": "<Service Name>",
       "config": {
         "clusterName": "<Atlas Cluster>",
         "wireProtocolEnabled": <boolean>
       }
     }

  .. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 10 30
    
    * - Configuration Value
      - Description
    * - | :guilabel:`Service Name`
        | *name*
      - Required. The name of the MongoDB service.
    * - | :guilabel:`Atlas Cluster`
        | *config.clusterName*
      - Required. The name of the MongoDB Atlas cluster that you
        want to link to your application.
    * - | :guilabel:`MongoDB Connection String`
        | *config.wireProtocolEnabled*
      - Required. A boolean indicating whether {+service-short+} should allow
        clients to :doc:`connect to this cluster with a connection
        string over the wire protocol
        </mongodb/connect-over-the-wire-protocol>`.

title: Import the Application Directory
ref: import-the-application-directory
content: |
  Once you've added the MongoDB service configuration, all that's left
  is to import the function.

  A. Save the ``config.json``. 
  #. Navigate to the root of the exported application directory.
  #. Log in to MongoDB Atlas with {+cli-bin+}:  

     .. code-block:: shell

        realm-cli login --api-key="<my api key>" --private-api-key="<my private api key>"

  #. Import the directory:

     .. code-block:: shell

        realm-cli import

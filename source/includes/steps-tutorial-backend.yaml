title: Create a Repository
ref: create-github-repository
content: |

  To begin your application, create a GitHub repository. Use this
  repository to maintain your application's source code and for
  developers to submit issues to track ideas, tasks, or bugs. To create
  a repository, navigate to https://github.com/new and specify a
  repository name. Set the repository to 'public' and click the option
  to initialize it with a README file.

title: Create an HTTP Service
ref: create-http-service
content: |

  To communicate with GitHub from a MongoDB Realm application, you must
  communicate over the HTTP protocol via an HTTP Service. This allows
  you to react to GitHub events, such as creating a new issue on your
  repo. To create an HTTP service, navigate to the :guilabel:`3rd Party
  Services` page and click the "Add a Service" in the MongoDB Realm UI.
  Configure your service options by clicking the option for an HTTP
  Service and specify your service name before clicking "Add Service" on
  the bottom right.

---
title: Create a Webhook for Your Service
ref: create-webhook
content: |

  Creating a :wikipedia:`webhook <Webhook>` allows MongoDB Realm to
  execute a function when someone opens a new GitHub issue on your
  repository. To create a webhook for your newly created HTTP service,
  click your service name and click the "Add incoming webhook" button. 

  .. figure:: /images/add-incoming-webhook.png
     :alt: add incoming webhook

  To configure your webhook settings, specify a name for your webhook.
  Copy the :guilabel:`Webhook URL`. GitHub utilizes this Webhook URL to
  execute the function logic for your HTTP Service. Click the "Save"
  button to save your webhook.

    .. figure:: /images/configure-your-webhook.png
     :alt: MongoDB Realm - configure your webhook 

  Finally, add some logic to your webhook function. In the function, add
  any ``console.log`` statement. This ``console.log`` will be printed to
  your application logs when someone opens a new issue on your
  repository. It should look something like the following.  

  .. code-block:: javascript
    
     exports = function(payload, response) {
      console.log('- github event triggered -');
      return true;
    };

  .. note::

     After pasting the code into your function editor, click the "Save"
     button. Click the "Review and Deploy Changes" option on the top of
     the screen.

---
title: Configure GitHub to Use the Webhook URL
ref: configure-github
content: |

  To communicate between GitHub and Realm, configure GitHub with your
  Webhook URL, causing MongoDB Realm to execute the function logic upon
  the creation of a new issue on the GitHub Repository. On GitHub,
  navigate to the settings tab of your repository. Click the "add
  webhook" button. Paste your Webhook URL from MongoDB Realm into the
  input field that says "payload url". Set content type to
  "application/json". Click the option to "send me everything", allowing
  GitHub to send all events, including the new issue event, to your
  MongoDB Realm application. Finally, click the green "add webhook"
  button to finish adding your webhook.

    .. figure:: /images/configure-github-webhook.png
     :alt: configure your webhook
---
title: Confirm That Your Webhook Worked
ref: confirm-your-webhook
content: |

  Ensure that your GitHub Issue Tracker is functioning correctly so far
  by testing your webhook. To test if your webhook is working, open a
  new issue on your GitHub repository. You can use a different GitHub
  account if you want to simulate a real-life situation or use the
  account that you used to create your repository. Then check if your
  Realm app was prompted about the event, check your Realm application
  logs. Click the top-most result in the :guilabel:`Logs` Page to view
  the latest entry. It should be a log containing the text of your
  `console.log` statement, indicating that the webhook worked.

    .. figure:: /images/check-application-logs.png
     :alt: check app logs

  .. note::

     If your console didn't log, make sure you have clicked the blue
     "Review and Deploy" button at the top of the MongoDB Realm UI if it
     is visible.

title: Update Your Function To Add a MongoDB Document
ref: update-fn
content: |

  The GitHub Issue Tracker should insert a MongoDB Document into your
  Atlas collection. Inserting a document when someone creates a new
  issue opens your application to add new features, such as executing
  logic upon document insertion. Navigate to the "Function Editor" of
  your service.  Paste the following code into the function editor.

  .. code-block:: javascript
    
     exports = async function(payload, response) {
      // parse the payload body from github
      const {arg1, arg2} = payload.query;
      const contentTypes = payload.headers["Content-Type"];
      const body = payload.body;
      
      // set githubAction as the type of GitHub event is sending
      const githubAction = JSON.parse(payload.body.text()).action;
      
      // if it is a new issue being opened, insert a document
      if(githubAction === "opened"){ 
        const issueDoc = {
          title: JSON.parse(payload.body.text()).issue.title,
          url: JSON.parse(payload.body.text()).issue.url,
          timestamp: new Date()
        }
        // insert a document into your collection
        const insertDoc = await context.services.get("mongodb-atlas").db("tracker").collection("githubIssues").insertOne(issueDoc);
        console.log(JSON.stringify(insertDoc, null, 2));
      }
    };

  .. note::

     After pasting the code into your function editor, click the "Save"
     button. Click the "Review and Deploy Changes" option on the top of
     the screen.

title: Write a Comment When a Document Is Inserted
ref: write-comment-on-doc-insert
content: |

  The GitHub Issue Tracker should write a helpful comment on newly
  opened GitHub Issues. You can do this by creating a Database Trigger
  that executes a function using the `GitHub Issues API
  <https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/>`_ to write a comment to the
  GitHub Issue. In order to use the GitHub API a token is required.
  Click "Settings" on the top right corner of your GitHub Profile (not
  your repository settings).

    .. figure:: /images/click-settings-on-github.png
     :width: 250px
     :alt: click settings on GitHub

  Click the "Developer Settings" link on the bottom left. Then, click
  "Person access token". This page allows you to generate a new token.
  Click the "Generate new token" to generate a token that will allow you
  to use the GitHub API. Click the "repo" and "admin:repo_hook" `OAuth scope
  <https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/understanding-scopes-for-oauth-apps/>`_
  to grant read and write access to repository hooks, including the
  opening of new issues. Finally, click "Generate Token" to finish
  configuring your GitHub token. Copy the 40 digit token that GitHub has
  generated.

    .. figure:: /images/configure-access-token.png
     :alt: click settings on GitHub

---
title: Create a MongoDB Realm Value With the GitHub Token
ref: create-realm-value
content: |

  You can define a MongoDB Realm :doc:`Secret
  </values-and-secrets/define-a-secret>` to store your GitHub token
  securely. You can link this secret to a :doc:`Value
  </values-and-secrets/define-a-value>` to be used within your Database
  Trigger Function. To begin, navigate to the :guilabel:`Values &
  Secrets` page and click the "Add a Secret" button. Specify a secret
  name and paste your 40 digit GitHub API Token into the "Secret Value"
  input and then click "Save". 

    .. figure:: /images/add-your-secret-token.png
     :width: 550px
     :alt: add your secret token

  Next, click the "Values" tab and specify a value name (this value name
  will be used in our trigger function later). Set the "Value Type" as
  "Secret" and set the "Secret Name" as the secret you created in your
  previous step. Finally, click the save button. Saving your value will
  allow it to be accessible in any MongoDB Realm Function via the script
  ``context.values.get("myGithubTokenVal")``.

  .. note::

     In the screenshot below, a value is created called
     "myGithubTokenVal". If you have created your value with an
     alternative name, access your value in a MongoDB Realm Function via
     the script ``context.values.get("<value-name>")`` and replace
     "<value-name>" with the name of your value.

   .. figure:: /images/create-a-value.png

---
title: Create a Database Trigger
ref: create-db-trigger
content: |

  You can create a Database Trigger to enable your Issue Tracking app to
  respond to a new issue document by executing function logic. You can
  use function logic to perform actions, such as utilizing the GitHub
  API. To create your database trigger, navigate to the
  :guilabel:`Triggers` page and click the "Add a trigger button". Set
  your database and collection as the same database and collection that
  you insert documents related to GitHub issues into. Set the "operation
  type" to "Insert" for the trigger to fire upon document inserts in the
  collection.

   .. figure:: /images/configure-db-trig.png
     :alt: configure the db trigger

  Set the event type as "Function" and create a new function. This
  function will use the GitHub API to comment on the opened issue
  automatically.

---
title: Automatically Comment on GitHub Issues
ref: comment-on-github-issues
content: |

  You can add application logic to your Database trigger function to add
  a helpful comment on newly opened GitHub issues using the GitHub API.
  Paste the following code in your Database trigger function to post to
  GitHub when there is a new issue.

  .. code-block:: javascript
    
     exports = function (changeEvent) { // the changeEvent refers to the document inserted
       const githubToken = context.values.get("myGithubTokenVal"); // your GitHub access token

       const url = changeEvent.fullDocument.url; // the url of the issue

       const http = context.services.get("github"); // replace "github" with the name of your HTTP Service from Step 1, if you chose a different name

       const githubURL = `${url}/comments`;

       return http.post({
         url: githubURL,
         body: {
           body:
             "Hi this is the GitHub issue tracker bot for <github username>, thank you for leaving an issue. We will respond to your issue shortly. For now, check out  stackoverflow  for helpful tips: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mongodb",
         },
         encodeBodyAsJSON: true,
         headers: {
           "Authorization": [`Token ${githubToken}`],
         },
       })
      .then(response => {
        // The response body is encoded as raw BSON.Binary. Parse it to JSON.
        const ejson_body = EJSON.parse(response.body.text());
        console.log(ejson_body);
        return ejson_body;
      })
      .catch(err => console.error(`An error has occurred with the DB Trigger: ${err}`));
     };

---
title: Confirm That Your DB Trigger Function Worked
ref: comment-db-trigger-fn
content: |

  Testing that your Database Trigger Function worked is the next step in
  building your Task Tracker Application. Create a new issue on your
  GitHub repository. When there is a new issue, your webhook inserts a
  document into your collection, invoking the database trigger function.
  View the inserted document by navigating to the "Atlas" tab on the top
  of your MongoDB Realm UI. Click the :guilabel:`Collections` button for your
  cluster. Once you have navigated to your collections view, click the
  name of your collection in order to see your inserted document.

     :alt: view the collections for your cluster

   .. figure:: /images/backendtut-view-docs.png
     :alt: view the documents in your collection

  The database trigger function automatically comments on the GitHub
  issue with a helpful comment.

---
title: Create a Scheduled Trigger With Digest Info On The GitHub Issues
ref: create-scheduled-trigger
content: |

  Create a scheduled to execute logic at a specific time. Your GitHub
  Task Tracker will utilize the scheduled trigger to log a weekly
  summary of the issues created. To create a scheduled trigger, navigate
  to the :guilabel:`Triggers` page and configure your trigger as a
  "Scheduled" trigger type. Then set the trigger to repeat once by the
  "Day of the Week" on "Sunday" to have the trigger fire every Sunday.
  You can choose an alternate day of the week, or switch the frequency
  of the scheduled trigger. Finally, set the event type as "Function"
  and paste the following code into your scheduled trigger function.

  .. note::

     In the code block below, a message is printed to the console. To
     further expand on your MongoDB Realm application, you could, for example, remove
     this message and hook MongoDB Realm to an automatic email service
     such as SendGrid to print the message.

  .. code-block:: javascript
    
     exports = async function() {
       const collection = context.services.get("mongodb-atlas").db("tracker").collection("githubIssues");
       const query = {
         timestamp: {
         $gte: new Date(new Date() - 7 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 1000)
         }
       };
       const projection = { "_id": 0, "title": 1 };
       return collection.find(query, projection)
         .toArray()
         .then(items => {
           
           // set all the issue titles as a string
           let issuesTitles = "";
           items.forEach((item) => {
             issuesTitles += `| ${item.title} |`
           })
           console.log(`Thanks for signing up for the weekly digest letter of our GitHub issues tracker app. This week you had ${items.length} issues submitted. The following  issues were created: ${issuesTitles}.`);
         });
     };

title: Verify that the Trigger Configuration File Exists
ref: verify-that-the-trigger-configuration-file-exists
content: |
  If you exported a new copy of your application, it should already include an
  up-to-date configuration file for the suspended trigger. You can confirm that
  the configuration file exists by looking in the ``/triggers`` directory for a
  :ref:`trigger configuration file <config-database-trigger>` with the same name
  as the trigger.

  After you have verified that the trigger configuration file exists, push the
  configuration back to your app. {+service+} automatically attempts to resume
  any suspended triggers included in the deployment.

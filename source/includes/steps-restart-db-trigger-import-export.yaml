title: Export Your Stitch Application
ref: export-your-application
content: |
  Stitch automatically attempts to resume any suspended triggers that
  are included in an imported :ref:`application directory
  <application-directory>`. To begin restarting a suspended trigger,
  :doc:`export </deploy/export-stitch-app>` a copy of your
  application from the :guilabel:`Export` tab of the
  :guilabel:`Settings` page in the Stitch UI, or by running the
  following command from an authenticated instance of :doc:`stitch-cli
  </deploy/stitch-cli-reference>`:
  .. code-block:: shell
     stitch-cli export --app-id=<App ID>.

title: Verify that the Trigger Configuration File Exists
ref: verify-that-the-trigger-configuration-file-exists
content: |
  If you exported a new copy of your application, it should already
  include an up-to-date configuration file for the suspended trigger.
  You can confirm that the configuration file exists by looking in the
  ``/triggers`` directory for a :ref:`trigger configuration file
  <appschema-triggers>` with the same name as the trigger.

title: Import Your Application Directory
ref: import-your-application-directory
content: |
  After you have verified that the trigger configuration file exists,
  import the trigger configuration by running the following command from
  the root of your exported application directory:
  .. code-block:: shell
     stitch-cli import
...

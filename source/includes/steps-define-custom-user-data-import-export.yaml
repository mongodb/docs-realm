  To define custom user data with {+cli-bin+}, you need a local copy of your
  application's configuration files.
  
  To pull a local copy of the latest version of your app, run the following:
  
  .. code-block:: bash
     
     realm-cli pull --remote="<Your App ID>"
  
  .. tip::
     
     You can also download a copy of your application's configuration files from
     the :guilabel:`Deploy > Export App` screen in the {+ui+}.

title: Configure Custom User Data
ref: configure-custom-user-data
content: |
  You must store the custom data for your application's users in a single
  collection of a :ref:`linked Atlas cluster <link-a-data-source>`. Every
  document in the collection should include a specific field that contains the
  user ID of the {+service-short+} user that it describes.

  To configure your application to read user data from this collection, define a
  :ref:`custom user data configuration document <config-custom-user-data>` in
  the ``/auth/custom_user_data.json``:

  .. code-block:: javascript
     :caption: /auth/custom_user_data.json
     
     {
       "enabled": <Boolean>,
       "mongo_service_name": "<MongoDB Data Source Name>",
       "database_name": "<Database Name>",
       "collection_name": "<Collection Name>",
       "user_id_field": "<Field Name>"
     }
---
title: Deploy the Custom User Data Configuration
ref: deploy-the-custom-user-data-configuration
content: |
  Once you've configured custom user data, you can push the updated config to
  your remote app. {+cli+} immediately deploys the update on push.
  
  .. code-block:: bash
     
     realm-cli push --remote="<Your App ID>"

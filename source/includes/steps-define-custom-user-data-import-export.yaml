title: Export Your Realm Application
ref: export-your-realm-application
content: |
  You can set up and enable custom user data through Realm CLI or
  automatic GitHub deployment. To configure custom user data, you need
  the latest version of the :ref:`application directory
  <application-directory>` for your application.

  You can :doc:`export </deploy/export-stitch-app>` your application
  from the :guilabel:`Export` tab of the :guilabel:`Settings` page in
  the Stitch UI, or by running the following command from an
  authenticated instance of :doc:`stitch-cli
  </deploy/stitch-cli-reference>`:

  .. code-block:: shell

     stitch-cli export --app-id=<App ID>

title: Configure Custom User Data
ref: configure-custom-user-data
content: |
  You must store the custom data for your application's users in a
  single collection of a linked MongoDB Atlas cluster. Every document in
  the collection should have a field that contains the user ID of the
  Realm user that it describes.
  
  To configure your application to read user data from this collection,
  specify a configuration document in the ``custom_user_data_config``
  field of ``stitch.json``:
  
  .. code-block:: json
     :caption: stitch.json

     {
       ...,
       "custom_user_data_config": {
         "enabled": <boolean>,
         "mongo_service_id": "<Linked MongoDB Cluster Service ID>",
         "database_name": "<Database Name>",
         "collection_name": "<Collection Name>",
         "user_id_field": "<User ID Field Name>"
       }
     }
  
  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 20 80
     
     * - Field
       - Description
     
     * - ``enabled``
       - A boolean that, if ``true``, indicates that Realm should
         associate data in the specified collection with application
         users.
     
     * - ``mongo_service_id``
       - The service ID of the :doc:`linked MongoDB cluster </mongodb>`
         that contains the custom user data collection.
     
     * - ``database_name``
       - The name of the MongoDB database that contains the custom user
         data collection.
     
     * - ``collection_name``
       - The name of the MongoDB collection that contains custom user
         data.
     
     * - ``user_id_field``
       - The name of a field that contains an application user's ID
         value. All user documents in the collection must have this
         field and no two documents may contain the same user ID.

title: Deploy the Updated Application
ref: deploy-the-updated-application
content: |
  Once you have configured the customer user data collection, you can
  make custom user data available to client applications by deploying
  your application.
  
  To deploy a draft application with Realm CLI:

  .. code-block:: shell

     stitch-cli import
  
  To deploy a draft application with automatic :doc:`GitHub deployment
  </deploy/deploy-automatically-with-github>`:

  .. code-block:: shell

     git add stitch.json
     git commit -m "Configure and Enable Custom User Data"
     git push origin master

  Once the application successfully deploys, Realm begins to associate
  custom data with users. When a user logs in, Realm automatically
  queries the custom user data collection for a document where the
  specified :guilabel:`User ID Field` contains the user's ID. If a
  document matches, Realm exposes the data in the document in the
  ``custom_data`` field of that user's :ref:`user object
  <user-objects>`.

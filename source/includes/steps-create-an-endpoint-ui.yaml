title: Set Up a New HTTPS Endpoint
ref: set-up-a-new-https-endpoint
content: |
  You can create and manage endpoints from the HTTPS Endpoints page in
  the Realm UI.

  To create an HTTPS endpoint:

  1. Click :guilabel:`HTTPS Endpoints` in the {+leftnav+}.

  #. Click :guilabel:`Add An Endpoint`. Realm will open
     the configuration screen for the new endpoint.
---
title: Name the New HTTPS Endpoint
ref: name-the-new-https-endpoint
content: |
  Enter a unique, identifying route for the endpoint in the
  :guilabel:`Route` field. The route controls the
  URI suffix used to access your endpoint.
---
title: Select the Endpoint's HTTP Method
ref: select-the-endpoints-http-method
content: |
  You can require that incoming requests use a specific :mdn:`HTTP
  method <Web/HTTP/Methods>` or you can accept all HTTP methods and
  handle each one individually in the endpoint function by inspecting the
  ``httpMethod`` property on the :ref:`context.request
  <context-request>` object, as in the following example function:

  .. include:: /includes/endpoint-http-method-handler.rst

  .. figure:: /images/endpoint-http-method-dropdown.png
     :alt: The HTTP method dropdown input in the UI
---
title: Configure Request Validation
ref: configure-request-validation
content: |
  You can require every request to include additional information that
  proves the validity of the request. Choose the request validation
  method for the endpoint from the following options:

  .. list-table::
     :widths: 20 80
     :header-rows: 1
     
     * - Method
       - Description
     
     * - No Additional Authorization
       - Authenticated requests do not need to include authorization information.
     
     * - Verify Payload Signature
       - Authenticated requests must include an ``Endpoint-Signature`` header
         with a signed hash of the request body.
         
         For details, see :ref:`Payload Signature Verification
         <endpoint-payload-signature-verification>`.
     
     * - Require Secret
       - Authenticated requests must include a secret value in the
         ``secret`` query parameter of the endpoint URL.

         For details, see :ref:`Secret Query Parameter
         <endpoint-secret-query-parameter>`.

title: Configure the Endpoint Response
ref: configure-the-endpoint-response
content: |
  You can send a configurable :mdn:`HTTP Response
  <Web/HTTP/Messages#HTTP_Responses>` to external services that call the
  endpoint.

  If you enable :guilabel:`Respond With Result`, the endpoint will
  respond to incoming requests with a basic :mdn:`HTTP 200
  <Web/HTTP/Status/200>` response that includes the endpoint function
  return value as its ``body`` field. You can configure a custom HTTP
  response from within the endpoint function using the ``response``
  object that Realm automatically passes as the second argument.

title: Write the Endpoint Function
ref: write-the-endpoint-function
content: |
  Next, write the function that executes when someone calls the endpoint.
  Realm automatically passes two objects as the endpoint function's
  arguments:

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 10 30

     * - Argument
       - Description

     * - ``payload``
       - An EJSON representation of the incoming request payload. The
         payload document contains:

         - The request query parameters, as an object.

         - The request headers, as an object.

         - The request body, as a binary object. You can access the
           contents as a string using the ``body.text()`` method.

     * - ``response``
       - An :ref:`HTTP response object <endpoint-response-object>` that
         configures Realm's response to the client that called the
         endpoint. The object has methods that allow you to set the
         response's headers, body, and status code. Calling any of these
         methods overrides the default response behavior.

  You can use the following endpoint function as a base for your own endpoint:

  .. literalinclude:: /includes/endpoint-function-example.js
     :language: javascript

  .. note::

     If you want to debug a endpoint function response from the function
     editor, you must manually provide the HTTP response object when you
     run the function.

     .. code-block:: javascript

        exports(
          { body: "This document is the endpoint payload" },
          new HTTPResponse()
        )
---
title: Save the Endpoint
ref: save-the-endpoint
content: |
  You must save changes to your endpoint before they take effect. To do
  so, click :guilabel:`Save` from either the :guilabel:`Settings` screen
  or the :guilabel:`Function Editor`.

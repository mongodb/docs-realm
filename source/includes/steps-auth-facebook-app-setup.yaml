  When a user completes the login flow for your Facebook app they need

  authentication callback URL that corresponds to the :doc:`deployment
  region </admin/deployment-models-and-regions>` of your application to
  the list of :guilabel:`Valid OAuth Redirect URIs`.
  The following table lists the callback URL for each region:

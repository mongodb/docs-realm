title: Verify that the Trigger Configuration File Exists
ref: verify-that-the-trigger-configuration-file-exists
content: |
  If you exported a new copy of your application, it should already include an
  up-to-date configuration file for the suspended trigger. You can confirm that
  the configuration file exists by looking in the ``/triggers`` directory for a
  :ref:`trigger configuration file <config-database-trigger>` with the same name
  as the trigger.

  After you have verified that the trigger configuration file exists, add
  a field named ``"disabled"`` with the value ``true`` to the top level
  of the trigger json definition:

  .. code-block:: json
     :emphasize-lines: 9

     {
        "id": "6142146e2f052a39d38e1605",
        "name": "steve",
        "type": "SCHEDULED",
        "config": {
           "schedule": "*/1 * * * *"
        },
        "function_name": "myFunc",
        "disabled": true
     }

  Finally, push the configuration back to your app:

  .. code-block:: shell

     realm-cli push

title: Clone the Client App Repository
ref: clone-the-client-app-repository
content: |
  We've already put together a task tracker iOS application that has most of the
  code you'll need. You can clone the client application repository directly
  from :github:`GitHub <mongodb-university/realm-tutorial-ios-swift>`:

  .. code-block:: shell

     git clone --branch start https://github.com/mongodb-university/realm-tutorial-ios-swift.git

  .. tip::
   
     The ``start`` branch is an incomplete version of the app that we will
     complete in this tutorial. To view a local-only version of the app:

     1. Navigate to the root directory of the client application repository:

        .. code-block:: shell

           cd realm-tutorial-ios-swift

     #. Check out the ``local`` branch:

        .. code-block:: shell

           git checkout local

     #. Run the app by clicking the "Play" button in the upper-left
        corner of the Xcode window.

title: Explore the App Structure
ref: explore-the-app-structure
content: |

  In the Xcode Project Navigator, you can see the source files of the task
  tracker application in the ``Task Tracker`` folder. The relevant files are as follows:

  .. cssclass:: config-table
  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 40 60
     
     * - File
       - Purpose

     * - Models.swift
       - Define the Realm object models used by this app.

     * - SceneDelegate.swift
       - Part 2: Declare the global {+app+} instance for the {+sync+} 
         portion of the tutorial.
     
     * - WelcomeViewController.swift
       - Implement the login and user registration functionality.
     
     * - TasksViewController.swift
       - Create the list view for the tasks in a given project.

     * - ProjectsViewController.swift
       - Part 2: Display the list of projects where the logged
         in user is a member.

     * - ManageTeamViewController.swift
       - Part 2: Manage members of a user's project.

title: Define the Object Models
ref: define-the-object-models
content: |
  Navigate to the Models.swift file to implement the Realm Object Models used in
  this app. Realm object models derive from ``Object`` from the
  ``RealmSwift`` library, which allows us to store them in {+client-database+}.
  The Task class is currently just a normal Swift class. Let's turn it
  into a Realm object model:

  .. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/swift-ios/local/Models.codeblock.task-model.swift
     :language: swift

  .. note::

     To learn more about how {+service-short+} Object models are used in iOS applications, 
     see :ref:`ios-read-and-write-data` in our iOS client guide.

title: Implement the Tasks List
ref: implement-the-tasks-list
content: |
  Navigate to the TasksViewController.swift file, where we'll implement the list
  of Tasks in a Project. The TasksViewController class holds an array of Task
  objects. We already converted the Task class to a Realm object model. In order
  to hold a live collection of Realm objects contained in a realm, we need to
  use ``RealmResults`` instead of a standard Swift array. Let's convert that
  property from an array of Tasks (``[Task]``) to a RealmResults collection
  of Tasks (``Results<Task>``) now:

  .. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/swift-ios/local/TasksViewController.codeblock.properties.swift
     :language: swift

  We can initialize the ``tasks`` property with a query on the project realm.
  Once we have the live tasks collection, we can observe that for changes:

  .. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/swift-ios/local/TasksViewController.codeblock.init.swift
     :language: swift

  Calls to ``observe`` Realm objects return a notificationToken. Retain
  the notificationToken as long as you want to continue observing. When
  done observing -- for example, because the user navigated away from this view
  -- be sure to invalidate the token. The ``deinit`` method is a good place to
  do this:

  .. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/swift-ios/local/TasksViewController.codeblock.deinit.swift
     :language: swift

  The TasksViewController already populates the UI using the Tasks in the list.
  Check out the ``tableView(_:numberOfRowsInSection:)`` and
  ``tableView(_:cellForRowAt:)`` methods to see how the Realm object model
  version of the Task class and the RealmResults object are drop-in replacements
  for the regular class and array respectively. No changes are required in these
  methods.

  The TasksViewController also wires up the Add button at the top of the view to
  the ``addButtonDidClick()`` method. We can implement the Task creation in this
  method:

  .. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/swift-ios/local/TasksViewController.codeblock.add-button-did-click.swift
     :language: swift

  When the user selects a Task in the list, we present them with an action sheet
  to allow them to update the Task's status. Complete the
  ``tableView(_:didSelectRowAt:)`` method implementation as follows:

  .. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/swift-ios/local/TasksViewController.codeblock.populate-action-sheet.swift
     :language: swift

  To handle swipes to delete a Task, we implement the
  ``tableView(_:commit:forRowAt:)`` method:

  .. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/swift-ios/local/TasksViewController.codeblock.delete-task.swift
     :language: swift

---
title: Enable Sign-in
ref: sign-in
content: |
  Finally, go to the WelcomeViewController and implement the ``signIn()`` 
  method. Create a {+realm+} configuration that specifies which "project" to 
  open and pass it to the TasksViewController:

  .. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/swift-ios/local/WelcomeViewController.codeblock.sign-in.swift
     :language: swift

  .. note::

     TasksViewController works the same whether we're using Sync or not. That
     makes it easier to add Sync later in Part 2. We'll only need to change the
     configuration we pass into TasksViewController.
---
title: Run and Test
ref: run-and-test
content: |
  Once you have completed the code, you can run the app and check functionality.

  Click the :guilabel:`Run` button in Xcode. If the app builds successfully,
  here are some things you can try in the app:

  - Create a user with username *test*
  - Navigate to "My Project"
  - Add, update, and remove some tasks

  .. tip::
   
     If something isn't working for you, you can check out the ``local`` branch of 
     this repo to compare your code with our finished solution.

title: Copy Your App ID
ref: copy-app-id
content: |

  Your app ID is used to connect to your {+service+} application from
  the Client SDKs. To copy your App ID, click the :guilabel:`copy`
  button on the left hand side of your application dashboard. 

  .. note::

      The UI displays your app name in the top left. When you click the
      copy button, the UI copies your app ID, not your app name, into
      your clipboard. For example, the UI would display the name
      "exampleApp" but copy the id "exampleApp-wlkgs".

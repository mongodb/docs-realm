title: Upload Files to Realm
ref: upload-files-to-realm
content: |
  You can upload files to Realm individually or select multiple files
  or file directories to upload simultaneously. All files that you
  upload must be available on your local filesystem.

  There are two ways to upload files through the Realm UI. You can
  use either of the following methods:

  - Drag and drop files from your local filesystem on to the
    :guilabel:`Hosting` screen.

  - Click :guilabel:`Upload Files` and select the files you wish to
    upload from a file picker.

  Once you have dropped in or selected your files, Realm will begin
  uploading them immediately. The upload might take some time to
  complete depending on the number and size of the files you selected as
  well as your network connection.

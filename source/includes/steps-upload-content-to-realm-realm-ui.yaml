title: Upload Files to Realm
ref: upload-files-to-realm
content: |
  You can upload files to {+service+} individually or select multiple files
  or file directories to upload simultaneously. All files that you
  upload must be available on your local filesystem.

  There are two ways to upload files through the {+ui+}. You can
  use either of the following methods:

  - Drag and drop files from your local filesystem on to the
    :guilabel:`Hosting` screen.

  - Click :guilabel:`Upload Files` and select the files you wish to
    upload from a file picker.

  Once you have dropped in or selected your files, {+service-short+} will begin
  uploading them immediately. The rate of upload time will vary depending
  on network connection speed and the number and size of the files
  selected.

title: Clone the Client App Repository
ref: clone-the-client-app-repository
content: |
  We've put together a React Native application that has
  most of the code you'll need. Clone the client application repository
  directly from :github:`GitHub <mongodb-university/realm-tutorial-react-native>`:

  .. code-block:: shell

     git clone --branch start https://github.com/mongodb-university/realm-tutorial-react-native.git

  .. tip::
   
     The ``start`` branch is an incomplete version of the app that we will
     complete in this tutorial. To view the finished app, check out the
     ``final`` branch, install dependencies (as described in the next step), 
     and update ``getRealmApp.js`` with your :ref:`Realm app ID <find-your-app-id>`.

title: Install Dependencies and Launch the App
ref: install-dependencies-and-launch-the-app

  In your terminal, run the following commands to navigate to the task tracker
  client application and install its dependencies:

  .. code-block:: shell
     
     cd realm-tutorial-react-native
     npm install

  If you plan to run the app on an iOS device or emulator, you need to install 
  additional dependencies with 
  `CocoaPods <https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html>`__. Change 
  directories to the ``ios`` directory and run ``pod install``, as shown here:

  .. code-block:: shell
     
     cd ios
     pod install --repo-update
     cd ..

  Be sure to switch back to the :guilabel:`realm-tutorial-react-native` root 
  directory after installing the pods.

title: Test the Setup
ref: test-setup
content: |
  At this point, you have a React Native app that can run on both iOS and Android. 
  We haven't yet implemented the necessary code for app 
  functionality, so there will be errors when the app loads, but you can 
  ensure that the app deploys properly. 

  Start by running `Metro <https://facebook.github.io/metro/>`__ in a terminal 
  window by using the following command:

  .. code-block:: shell

     npx react-native start

  Leave Metro running, and in a **separate terminal window**, issue one of the 
  following commands, depending on whether you want to run on iOS or Android:

  .. code-block:: shell

     npx react-native run-ios

  or

  .. code-block:: shell

     npx react-native run-android

  After the emulator is started and the bits have been deployed, you should see 
  the app is "running" and one or more errors are displayed:
    
  .. figure:: /images/rn-app-initial-state.png
    :alt: The initial state of React Native app
    :width: 250px

  .. important:: CompileC Error
    
     If, when compiling the iOS app, you get a CompileC build error that involves
     "Flipper," you will need to edit ``/ios/Podfile``. Look for the section 
     that enables Flipper and comment out those lines:

     .. code-block:: text

        # Enables Flipper.
        #
        # Note that if you have use_frameworks! enabled, Flipper will not work and
        # you should disable these next few lines.
        # use_flipper!
        #post_install do |installer|
        #  flipper_post_install(installer)
        #end

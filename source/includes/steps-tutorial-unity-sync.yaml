  Finally, go to the WelcomeViewController and implement the ``signIn()`` 
  method. Create a {+realm+} configuration that specifies which "project" to 
  open and pass it to the TasksViewController:

  .. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/swift-ios/local/WelcomeViewController.codeblock.sign-in.swift
     :language: swift

  .. note::

     TasksViewController works the same whether we're using Sync or not. That
     makes it easier to add Sync later in Part 2. We'll only need to change the
     configuration we pass into TasksViewController.

  Once you have completed the code, you can run the app and check functionality.

  Click the :guilabel:`Run` button in Xcode. If the app builds successfully,
  here are some things you can try in the app:

  - Create a user with username *test*
  - Navigate to "My Project"
  - Add, update, and remove some tasks

     If something isn't working for you, you can check out the ``local`` branch of 
     this repo to compare your code with our finished solution.

title: Clone the Client App Repository
ref: foo-bar-one
content: |
  We've already put together a task tracker iOS application that has most of the
  code you'll need. You can clone the client application repository directly
  from :github:`GitHub <mongodb-university/realm-tutorial-ios-swift>`:

  .. code-block:: shell

     git clone --branch start https://github.com/mongodb-university/realm-tutorial-ios-swift.git

  .. tip::
   
     The ``start`` branch is an incomplete version of the app that we will
     complete in this tutorial. To view a local-only version of the app:

     1. Navigate to the root directory of the client application repository:

        .. code-block:: shell

           cd realm-tutorial-ios-swift

     #. Check out the ``local`` branch:

        .. code-block:: shell

           git checkout local

     #. Run the app by clicking the "Play" button in the upper-left
        corner of the Xcode window.

  In the Xcode Project Navigator, you can see the source files of the task
  tracker application in the ``Task Tracker`` folder. The relevant files are as follows:

  .. cssclass:: config-table
  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 40 60
     
     * - File
       - Purpose

     * - Models.swift
       - Define the Realm object models used by this app.

     * - SceneDelegate.swift
       - Part 2: Declare the global {+app+} instance for the {+sync+} 
         portion of the tutorial.
     
     * - WelcomeViewController.swift
       - Implement the login and user registration functionality.
     
     * - TasksViewController.swift
       - Create the list view for the tasks in a given project.

     * - ProjectsViewController.swift
       - Display the user's list of projects. In the local app, there is
         only the local user's project. In Part 2, when we add Sync, 
         we'll add the projects where the logged in user is a member.

     * - ManageTeamViewController.swift
       - Part 2: Manage members of a user's project.

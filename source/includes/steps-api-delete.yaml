ref: app-delete-endpoint
content: |
  The API has an :admin-api-endpoint:`endpoint <operation/adminDeleteApplication>`
  through which you can delete an {+app+}. 
  Your request should include: 

  - The ``access_token`` from step 1 in a :mdn:`Bearer token <Web/HTTP/Authentication>` ``Authorization`` header.

  - The :admin-api-endpoint:`Group ID/Project ID <section/Project-and-Application-IDs>` from step 2.

  - The :admin-api-endpoint:`Application ID <section/Get-Authentication-Tokens>` from step 3.

  .. code-block:: shell
    
     curl --request DELETE 'https://realm.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/<GroupID>/apps/<ApplicationID>' \
       --header 'Authorization:  Bearer <access_token>' \
       --header 'Content-Type: application/json'

  If your application deletes successfully, the {+backend+} returns a ``204`` response.

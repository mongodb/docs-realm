ref: app-delete-endpoint

  The API has an :admin-api-endpoint:`endpoint <delete-/groups/%7Bgroupid%7D/apps/%7Bappid%7D>`
  through which you can delete an {+app+}. Make sure to include the access token 
  from the first step in a 
  :mdn:`Bearer token <Web/HTTP/Authentication>` ``Authorization`` header. You will also
  need your :ref:`Group ID/Project ID <realm-api-project-and-application-ids>` 
  and the Application ID from the previous step.
  
  .. code-block:: shell
    
    curl --request DELETE 'https://realm.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/<group id>/apps/<Application ID>' \
      --header 'Authorization:  Bearer <access token>' \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
  
  If creation succeeds the {+backend+} returns a ``204`` response.

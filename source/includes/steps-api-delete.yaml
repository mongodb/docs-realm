title: Authenticate a MongoDB Atlas User
ref: authenticate-atlas-user
content: |
  Use your MongoDB Cloud API key pair to call the authentication endpoint:

  .. code-block:: shell
    
     curl --request POST \
       --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
       --header 'Accept: application/json' \
       --data '{"username": "<Public API Key>", "apiKey": "<Private API Key>"}' \
       https://realm.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/auth/providers/mongodb-cloud/login

  If authentication succeeds, {+backend+} returns an access token as part of
  the JSON response document:

  .. code-block:: json
     :emphasize-lines: 2

     {
       "access_token": "<access_token>",
       "refresh_token": "<refresh_token>",
       "user_id": "<user_id>",
       "device_id": "<device_id>"
     }

  Save the ``access_token``, which you'll use as the Bearer token to authenticate in the upcoming steps.

title: Delete the Realm App
ref: app-delete-endpoint
content: |
  The API has an :admin-api-endpoint:`endpoint <delete-/groups/%7Bgroupid%7D/apps/%7Bappid%7D>`
  through which you can delete an {+app+}. 
  Your request should include: 

  - The ``access_token`` from step 1 in a :mdn:`Bearer token <Web/HTTP/Authentication>` ``Authorization`` header.
  
  - The :ref:`Group ID/Project ID <realm-api-project-and-application-ids>` from step 2.
  
  - The :ref:`Application ID <realm-api-application-id>` from step 3.

  .. code-block:: shell
    
     curl --request DELETE 'https://realm.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/<GroupID>/apps/<ApplicationID>' \
       --header 'Authorization:  Bearer <access_token>' \
       --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
  
  If your application deletes successfully, the {+backend+} returns a ``204`` response.

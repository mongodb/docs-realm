  The ``RealmApolloProvider`` component should call 
  ``createRealmApolloClient()`` to instantiate the client. Update the 
  component with the following code to create an ``ApolloClient`` object that 
  connects to your app:

  .. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/code/final/RealmApolloProvider.codeblock.realmApolloProvider.js
     :caption: ``src/graphql/RealmApolloProvider.js``
     :language: javascript

title: Authenticate GraphQL Requests
ref: authenticate-graph-ql-requests
level: 4

  The ``createRealmApolloClient()`` function now instantiates a client object, but
  you won't be able to run any GraphQL queries or mutations just yet. Every
  GraphQL request must include an Authorization header that specifies a valid
  user access token. The current client does not include any Authorization
  headers, so all requests it makes will fail.

  To fix this, update the ``createRealmApolloClient()`` function to include the
  current user's access token in an Authorization header with every request:

  .. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/code/final/RealmApolloProvider.codeblock.createRealmApolloClient.js
     :caption: ``src/graphql/RealmApolloProvider.js``
     :language: javascript

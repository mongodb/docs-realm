title: Make Changes to Your Application
ref: make-changes-to-your-application
content: |
  Start by making any additions, modifications, or deletions that you
  want to include in the deployment through the {+ui+}.
  If you have drafts enabled, your changes will be saved automatically as a draft. 

  .. seealso::
     
     Guide to :ref:`Disable Deployment Drafts <disable-deployment-drafts>`.

  .. note::
     
     You can only create draft changes through the {+ui+} or Admin
     API. Any changes that you make with GitHub or the {+cli+} are
     deployed independently of draft changes. To avoid possible conflicts or 
     inconsistencies, its best to make your changes in one place at a time.

title: Review Draft Changes
ref: review-draft-changes
content: |
  You can review all of the draft changes to your application prior to
  deploying them.

  Click :guilabel:`Deployment` in the {+leftnav+} to navigate to
  your app's deployment history table. The top row of the table
  represents all of the draft changes that you've made since the
  previous deployment.
  
  Click the :guilabel:`Review Draft and Deploy` button in the top row to
  see a diff of the underlying :ref:`app configuration files
  <app-config>` that represents the draft changes that you've made.

  .. note::
     
     You may want to download a draft of your changes because of merge conflicts 
     or to save the draft outside of the UI. You can do so in the 
     :guilabel:`Review Draft and Deploy` modal by clicking :guilabel:`Export State` 
     in the top right corner. You can use the download to deploy your changes in the
     {+cli-bin+} or as a reference as you reapply changes in the UI.

title: Deploy a New App Version
ref: deploy-a-new-app-version
content: |
  After you've reviewed your draft changes and confirmed that you want
  to deploy them, click :guilabel:`Deploy`. {+service-short+} deploys a
  new version of your application that includes the draft changes.
  Client applications will automatically use the newest version, so make
  sure that you also update your client code to use the new version if
  necessary.

  To enable static hosting with {+cli-bin+}, you need a local copy of your
  application's configuration files.
  
  To pull a local copy of the latest version of your app, run the following:
  
  .. code-block:: bash
     
     realm-cli pull --remote="<Your App ID>"
  
  .. tip::
     
     You can also download a copy of your application's configuration files from
     the :guilabel:`Deploy > Import/Export App` screen in the {+ui+}.

ref: create-a-static-hosting-configuration
content: |
  In ``hosting/config.json``, set ``enabled`` to ``true``, then save the file.

  .. code-block:: json
     :caption: /hosting/config.json
     
     { "enabled": true }

title: Deploy the Static Hosting Configuration
ref: deploy-the-static-hosting-configuration
content: |
  Once you've enabled static hosting, you can push the updated config to your
  remote app. {+cli+} immediately deploys your new configuration on push.
  
  .. code-block:: bash
     
     realm-cli push --remote="<Your App ID>  --include-hosting"

  .. note::
     
     It may take a few minutes for {+service-short+} to finish provisioning
     hosting for your application once you've enabled it. You can :doc:`upload
     content to {+service-short+} </hosting/upload-content-to-realm>`
     immediately, but you will need to wait for provisioning to complete before
     {+service-short+} serves your files.

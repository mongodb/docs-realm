  To enable static hosting for your  application with
  :doc:`realm-cli </deploy/realm-cli-reference>` you need to
  export an :ref:`application directory <application-directory>`.
  
  You can :doc:`export </deploy/export-realm-app>` your application from the
  :guilabel:`Import/Export App` tab of the :guilabel:`Deploy` page in the
  {+ui+}, or by running the following command from an authenticated instance of
  :doc:`realm-cli </deploy/realm-cli-reference>`:

  .. code-block:: none

     realm-cli export --app-id=<App ID>

title: Enable Hosting in the Application Configuration
ref: enable-hosting-in-the-application-configuration
content: |
  In :ref:`config.json <appschema-realm-config>`, set the value of
  ``hosting.enabled`` to ``true`` then save the file.

  .. code-block:: json

     "hosting": { "enabled": true }

---
title: Import the Updated Application Configuration
ref: import-the-updated-application-configuration
content: |
  Once you have enabled hosting in ``config.json``, you can import the
  directory into your application.
  Navigate to the root of the application directory and run the
  following command:

  .. code-block:: none

     realm-cli import

  {+service+} will begin provisioning hosting for your application after you
  successfully import the application directory.

  .. note::

     It may take a few minutes for {+service-short+} to finish provisioning hosting
     for your application once you've enabled it. You can :doc:`upload
     content to {+service-short+} </hosting/upload-content-to-realm>` immediately,
     but you will need to wait for provisioning to complete before
     {+service-short+} serves your files.

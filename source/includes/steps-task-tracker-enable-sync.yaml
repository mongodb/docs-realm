  Follow the instructions in the {+ui+} to configure sync for your cluster.

  1. **Select a Cluster to Sync:** {+sync+} applies to the entire cluster. Specify which cluster you want to sync in the dropdown.
  #. **Choose a Partition Key:** Enter ``_partition`` for the partition key. The partition key specifies which {+realm+} each object belongs to.
  #. **Define Permissions:** Select "No template" and leave the default, empty :guilabel:`Read` and :guilabel:`Write` rules.
     In a future tutorial, we will explore more complex permissions patterns.

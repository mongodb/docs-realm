  When you open the Platformer Microgame template, Unity prompts you with the
  option to :guilabel:`Load Scene` or :guilabel:`Load Tutorials`.

  If you are new to developing with Unity, click :guilabel:`Load Tutorials` to
  learn Unity editor basics, interacting with `GameObjects
  <https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject.html>`_, and more. Once
  you feel comfortable working with the Unity Editor, you can continue to the
  next step. Alternatively, if you are already comfortable working with the
  Unity editor, click :guilabel:`Load Scene` and continue to the next
  step in this tutorial.

  Once the scene is loaded, click the :guilabel:`Play` button on the top of the
  screen to enter `play mode <https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GameView.html>`_
  and play the game.

  To play the game, use the arrow keys to move your character, and the spacebar
  to jump. Hop on the "red slime" enemies to defeat them, making them disappear.
  Collide your character with the yellow "tokens" to collect them. Get to the
  end of the level to win the game.

  In later steps, you will use {+realm+} to record how many enemies the player
  defeated per playthrough, how many tokens were collected, and a score.

  Before you begin adding {+realm+} functionality to your project, install realm
  by following the `Install Realm <unity-install-realm>` steps in the Unity
  Integration guide. You can choose to install realm through a tarball or

  Next, add `UI ToolKit <https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UIElements.html>`_ and
  `UI Builder <https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/com.unity.ui.builder.html>`_ to
  your project. These packages will be used to develop user interfaces to
  interact with and display data stored in {+realm+}. 

  Open the `Unity package manager
  <https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui.html>`_  by clicking the
  :guilabel:`Window` tab on the top of the Unity menu. Click :guilabel:`Package
  Manager` from the :guilabel:`Window dropdown`. Once the package manager model
  opens, click the :guilabel:`+` icon in the top left corner of the model.
  Select the :guilabel:`Add package from git URL...` option.

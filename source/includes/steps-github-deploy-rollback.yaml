  In order to rollback to a prior deploy, you'll need to navigate to your 
  {+app+} Deployment History page.

  Click :guilabel:`Deployment` in the {+leftnav+} of the {+ui+}. Select the 
  :guilabel:`History` tab.

  You'll see the 25 most recent application deployments. The 
  :guilabel:`Change Origin` column shows whether the deploy originated from
  changes in the UI, the linked GitHub repository, the Admin API, or the CLI.

  Once you have selected a prior version to rollback to, press the 
  :guilabel:`Re-Deploy` button for that version of your {+app+}.
  
  If you have deployment drafts enabled, you'll see a modal notifying you 
  that this action will replace any changes in your current deployment 
  draft with the app configuration you want to re-deploy. Press the 
  :guilabel:`Re-Deploy` button.

  You'll see the banner at the top of your {+app+} notifying you that you 
  have changes to deploy. Press the :guilabel:`Review Draft & Deploy` button.

  Next, you'll see a Deployment Draft that shows you a diff of the 
  changes you'll apply when you complete this deploy. From here, you can
  specify a descriptive name for your deploy that will be visible in the
  Deployment History list. 
  
  After verifying the changes, press the :guilabel:`Deploy and Push to 
  GitHub` button.

  After the deployment completes, you'll see the deployment success banner.
  The new deployment appears in your Deployment History. It contains a link 
  to the commit in the GitHub repository. 
  
  In the linked GitHub repository, the commit author is the 
  ``mongodb-realm`` bot.

title: Navigate to the Sync Configuration Screen
ref: navigate-to-the-sync-configuration-screen
content: |
  To define sync rules and enable sync for your application, navigate to to the
  :guilabel:`Sync` configuration screen through the left navigation.

  .. admonition:: Sync Rules Cannot Change
     :class: note
     
     You define sync rules at the same time as you enable sync. Once sync is
     enabled, you can't change your app's sync rules unless you terminate sync
     and re-enable it with new rules.

title: Select a Cluster to Sync
ref: select-a-cluster-to-sync
content: |
  You can enable sync for a single :term:`linked cluster` in your application.
  Determine which cluster you want to use and then select it from the
  :guilabel:`Select Cluster To Sync` dropdown menu.

title: Choose a Partition Key
ref: choose-a-partition-key
content: |
  The sync :term:`partition key` is a field in every synced document that maps
  each document to a client-side realm. Sync rules apply at the partition level,
  so it's particularly important to consider your data model and access
  patterns. For more information on partition keys and how to choose one, see
  :ref:`Partition Atlas Data into Realms <partitioning>`.

  Once you have decided which field to use, select it from the :guilabel:`Choose
  A Partition Key` dropdown menu.

  .. note::
     
     The partition key dropdown only lists fields defined in the cluster's
     schemas that would be valid partition keys.
     
     If you don't see the field you want to use as the partition key listed, it
     probably means that your schema is invalid or that the field is not a
     ``string``, ``integer``, or ``objectId``. You can check for schema errors
     on the :guilabel:`Data Models` tab of the :guilabel:`SDKs` screen.

title: Define Read & Write Permissions
ref: define-read-write-permissions
content: |
  The :guilabel:`Define Permissions` section allows you to define :ref:`JSON
  expressions <expressions>` that Realm dynamically evaluates to determine a
  user's read and write permissions for the data in a given partition.
  
  Sync rule expressions have access to :json-expansion:`%%user`, which resolves
  to the user that opened the realm, and :json-expansion:`%%partition`, which
  resolves to the partition key value for the realm. You can also use operators,
  including :json-operator:`%function`, to handle more complex cases.

  Once you've determined how to decide a user's read and write permissions for a
  given partition, define the corresponding JSON expressions in the
  :guilabel:`Read` and :guilabel:`Write` inputs.

title: Turn On Sync
ref: turn-on-sync
content: |
  Now that you've configured rules for your synced cluster, all that's left to
  do is turn on sync for client applications. Click :guilabel:`Enable Sync`,
  take note of any recommendations that appear, and then confirm your choice.

  Depending on the rule template you selected, there will

  cluster. You can use these roles as they are, tweak them
  to fit your use case, or add additional roles to cover
  more cases.

  To add an additional role, click :guilabel:`New Role`. Enter a
  :guilabel:`Name` for the new role on the role configuration screen.

  A role's :guilabel:`Apply When` condition determines
  whether or not the role applies to a particular partition
  for the user that issued a query.

  Enter a :doc:`JSON Expression
  </services/json-expressions>` in the role's
  :guilabel:`Apply When` box. The expression should evaluate
  to ``true`` when the role applies to a given document.

  Once you have finished defining roles for the synced

title: Acquire the Custom Domain Name
ref: acquire-the-custom-domain-name

  You must own the custom domain name that you want to serve content
  from. If you don't already own the domain that you want to use, you
  will need to purchase it from a domain name registrar.

title: Pull the Latest Version of Your App
ref: pull-the-latest-version-of-your-app
content: |
  To configure a custom domain name with {+cli-bin+}, you need a local copy of
  your application's configuration files.

  To pull a local copy of the latest version of your app, run the following:

  .. code-block:: bash
     
     realm-cli pull --remote="<Your App ID>"

  .. tip::
     
     You can also download a copy of your application's configuration files from
     the :guilabel:`Deploy > Import/Export App` screen in the {+ui+}.

title: Specify the Custom Domain
ref: specify-the-custom-domain
content: |
  In ``hosting/config.json``, set ``custom_domain`` to your custom domain name
  then save the file.

  .. code-block:: json
     :caption: hosting/config.json
     
     {
       "enabled": true,
       "custom_domain": "example.com"
     }

  .. note::
     
     The value of ``custom_domain`` should be the root domain without
     any subdomains. For example, you should enter ``example.com``
     instead of ``www.example.com``.

title: Import the Application Directory
ref: import-the-application-directory
content: |
  Once you have specified your custom domain name, you can import the
  application directory.

  Navigate to the root of the application directory and run the
  following command:

  .. code-block:: shell

     realm-cli import --include-hosting
---
title: Deploy the Updated Hosting Configuration
ref: deploy-the-updated-hosting-configuration
content: |
  Once you've updated and saved ``hosting/config.json`` you can push the updated
  config to your remote app. {+cli+} immediately deploys the configuration on
  push and Realm immediately starts trying to verify your domain name.

  .. code-block:: bash
     
     realm-cli push --remote="<Your App ID>" --include-hosting

title: Add a Validation CNAME Record
ref: add-a-validation-cname-record
content: |
  To verify that you own the domain you must add a new :wikipedia:`CNAME
  record <CNAME_record>` in your domain's DNS configuration. You can
  find the host name and target value to use in the record
  :guilabel:`Custom Domain` section of the :guilabel:`Hosting >
  Settings` tab in the {+ui+}.

  Once you have added the validation record it may take some time for the
  DNS record to propagate. {+backend+} will periodically check the domain's
  DNS records for the validation ``CNAME`` and will mark the domain as
  verified if it finds the record.

  .. tip:: Troubleshooting

     - In the :guilabel:`Name` field of the {+ui+}, {+service-short+} provides 
       the full address for the CNAME record, ``<Subdomain>.<Your Base Domain>``. 
       However, many hosting providers just request the ``<Subdomain>`` part 
       to put in their UI. If you run into issues, check your hosting provider's 
       documentation on how to add CNAME records. 

     - {+service-short+} may not be able to find the validation record if your DNS
       provider proxies requests for the domain. If {+service-short+} cannot validate
       your domain, ensure that you have disabled any HTTP proxies for the
       validation CNAME record on your DNS provider.

     - If an error is encountered during custom domain name validation,
       {+service-short+} sends the project owner an email alerting them of the
       issue.

title: Add a Redirect CNAME Record
ref: add-a-redirect-cname-record
content: |
  Once {+service-short+} has verified your domain, all that's left to do is to add one or
  more ``CNAME`` DNS records for your domain that point to the default
  {+service-short+} domain. Use the following host name and target value:

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 10 30

     * - Value
       - Description

     * - Host Name
       - A subdomain such as ``www``.

     * - Target
       - The default domain for your application. This value is listed
         as the :guilabel:`Realm Domain` in the :guilabel:`Settings` tab
         of the :guilabel:`Hosting` page. The default domain has the
         following form:

         .. code-block:: none

            <Your App ID>.mongodbstitch.com

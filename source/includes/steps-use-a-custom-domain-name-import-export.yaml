title: Acquire the Custom Domain Name
ref: acquire-the-custom-domain-name
content: |
  You must own the custom domain name that you want to serve content
  from. If you don't already own the domain that you want to use, you
  will need to purchase it from a domain name registrar.

title: Export Your Realm Application
ref: export-your-application
content: |
  To specify a custom domain name with :doc:`realm-cli
  </deploy/realm-cli-reference>` you need to export an :ref:`application
  directory <application-directory>` for your application.

  You can :doc:`export </deploy/export-realm-app>` your application from
  the :guilabel:`Export` tab of the :guilabel:`Settings` page in the
  {+ui+}, or by running the following command from an authenticated
  instance of :doc:`realm-cli </deploy/realm-cli-reference>`:

  .. code-block:: shell

     realm-cli export --app-id=<App ID>
---
title: Specify the Custom Domain
ref: specify-the-custom-domain
content: |
  In :ref:`config.json <appschema-realm-config>`, set the value of
  ``hosting.custom_domain`` to your custom domain name then save the
  file.

  .. code-block:: json

     "hosting": {
       "enabled": true,
       "custom_domain": "example.com"
     }

  .. note::

     The value of ``custom_domain`` should be the root domain without
     any subdomains. For example, you should enter ``example.com``
     instead of ``www.example.com``.

---
title: Import the Application Directory
ref: import-the-application-directory
content: |
  Once you have specified your custom domain name, you can import the
  application directory.

  Navigate to the root of the application directory and run the
  following command:

  .. code-block:: shell

     realm-cli import --include-hosting
---
title: Add a Validation CNAME Record
ref: add-a-validation-cname-record
content: |
  To verify that you own the domain you must add a new :wikipedia:`CNAME
  record <CNAME_record>` in your domain's DNS configuration. You can
  find the host name and target value to use in the record
  :guilabel:`Custom Domain` section of the :guilabel:`Hosting >
  Settings` tab in the {+ui+}.

  Once you have added the validation record it may take some time for the
  DNS record to propagate. {+backend+} will periodically check the domain's
  DNS records for the validation ``CNAME`` and will mark the domain as
  verified if it finds the record.

  .. note::

     {+service-short+} may not be able to find the validation record if your DNS
     provider proxies requests for the domain. If {+service-short+} cannot validate
     your domain, ensure that you have disabled any HTTP proxies for the
     validation CNAME record on your DNS provider.

  .. note::

     If an error is encountered during custom domain name validation,
     {+service-short+} sends the project owner an email alerting them of the
     issue.
---
title: Add a Redirect CNAME Record
ref: add-a-redirect-cname-record
content: |
  Once {+service-short+} has verified your domain, all that's left to do is to add one or
  more ``CNAME`` DNS records for your domain that point to the default
  {+service-short+} domain. Use the following host name and target value:

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1
     :widths: 10 30

     * - Value
       - Description

     * - Host Name
       - A subdomain such as ``www``.

     * - Target
       - The default domain for your application. This value is listed
         as the :guilabel:`Realm Domain` in the :guilabel:`Settings` tab
         of the :guilabel:`Hosting` page. The default domain has the
         following form:

         .. code-block:: none

            <Your App ID>.mongodbrealm.com
...

  You can turn development mode on and off by setting a boolean value for
  ``development_mode_enabled`` in your app's ``sync/config.json`` file. To
  disable dev mode, set the value to ``false``:

  .. code-block:: json
     :caption: sync/config.json
     
     {
       "development_mode_enabled": false
     }

  Now that you've configured development mode and specified that it's disabled,
  you can deploy your changes to turn it on.

  To deploy your changes, import your app configuration:

  .. code-block:: shell
     
     realm-cli push --remote="<Your App ID>"

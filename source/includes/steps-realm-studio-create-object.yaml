  Once you've decided where to create your new object, you can do this in
  two ways: 
  
  - Click the :guilabel:`Create {Class name}` button in the upper right
    corner of the app
  - Right click (or control click) anywhere in the main window to bring 
    up the contextual menu, and select :guilabel:`Create new {Class name}`

  Either option will open a dialog where you can set the properties
  for the object. When you've specified the required properties, press the
  :guilabel:`Create` button.

  If you create an orphaned object that is not associated with a parent
  object via a linking property, you'll need to add it manually to the
  linked object. See: :ref:`Modify an Object <realm-studio-modify-an-object>`.

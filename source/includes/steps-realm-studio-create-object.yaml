  The left sidebar of Realm Studio displays the classes that constitute 
  the {+realm+}'s schema. Select the class in the model whose properties 
  define the object you want to create.

title: Consider the object relationships in your schema
ref: realm-studio-create-object-consider-object-relationships

  Consider the relationships of the objects in your schema. In a to-do 
  app, you might have categories and tasks. The categories have a to-many
  relationship to the tasks; one category may have many tasks. The tasks
  have an inverse relationship to the category. 
  
  In {+client-database+}, this type of relationship is represented as a 
  ``list`` property linking the two objects. For our to-do app, the
  ``Category`` class has a ``list`` property whose value is all of the 
  related Task objects.

  In the Realm Studio UI, you would select the ``Category`` class. Click 
  into the ``[list-of-task]`` property for the category where you want to 
  add the task - for example, "Work". You'll see all the task objects that 
  have an inverse relationship with the Work category. 

  From here, you might create a new task object to "Review PR 1013." When 
  you create the new task object from within the Work list, Realm Studio 
  sets the inverse relationship with the Work parent category.

  If you select the Task class directly, you could still create a new Task.
  But that task object would not have an inverse relationship with any 
  parent category. You would then have to manually add the orphaned task 
  object to the category where it belongs.

  Once you've decided where to create your new object, you can do this in
  two ways: 
  
  - Click the :guilabel:`Create {Class name}` button in the upper right
    corner of the app
  - Right click (or control click) anywhere in the main window to bring 
    up the contextual menu, and select :guilabel:`Create new {Class name}`

  Both of these options will open a dialog where you can set the properties
  for the object. When you've specified the required properties, press the
  :guilabel:`Create` button.

  If you created an orphaned object that is not associated with a parent
  object via a linking property, you'll need to add it manually to the
  linked object. See: :ref:`Modify an Object <realm-studio-modify-an-object>`.

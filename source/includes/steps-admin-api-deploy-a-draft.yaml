title: Create a New Draft
ref: create-a-new-draft
content: |
  A draft represents a group of application changes that you can deploy
  or discard as a single unit. To create a draft, send a ``POST``
  request to the drafts endpoint:

  .. code-block:: shell

     curl --request POST \
       --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
       --header 'Authorization: Bearer <access_token>' \
       'https://realm.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/{groupId}/apps/{appId}/drafts'

  .. important:: One Draft Per User
     
     Each user can only create a single draft at a time, either through
     the UI or the Admin API. If you already have an existing draft, you
     can discard the changes associated with it by sending a ``DELETE``
     request to the draft's endpoint:

     .. code-block:: shell

        curl --request DELETE \
          --header 'Authorization: Bearer <access_token>' \
          'https://realm.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/{groupId}/apps/{appId}/drafts/{draftId}'

  Once you've created a draft, make all of the changes that you want to
  include in the draft. {+service-short+} adds any application changes that you
  make to the draft so that you can deploy them together.

title: Deploy the Draft
ref: deploy-the-draft
content: |
  After you've made all the changes that you want to include in the
  deployment, deploy the draft by sending a ``POST`` request to that
  draft's deployment endpoint:

  .. code-block:: shell

     curl --request POST \
       --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
       --header 'Authorization: Bearer <access_token>' \
       'https://realm.mongodb.com/api/admin/v3.0/groups/{groupId}/apps/{appId}/drafts/{draftId}/deployment'

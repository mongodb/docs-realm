Overview
--------

In order to call a service action, you must first define a :ref:`service
rule <service-rules>` that enables and configures the capabilities of
the action. You can define service rules from the Realm UI or by
:doc:`importing </deploy/deploy-cli>` a service
configuration directory that contains a rule configuration file. Select
the tab below that corresponds to the method you want to use.

Developer Access
----------------

Every MongoDB Realm application is associated with a specific :atlas:`MongoDB
Atlas organization and project </organizations-projects>`. Realm determines the
developer access permissions for a given MongoDB Cloud user based on their
assigned :atlas:`project roles </access/manage-project-access>` in the project
that contains an app.

The following table describes the access permissions associated with a given
project role:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 60

   * - Project Role
     - Access Permissions

   * - Project Owner
     - Full read-write access for all {+app+}s associated with the project.

   * - Project Read Only
     - Read-only access for all {+app+}s associated with the project.

.. note::

   For more information about adding users and teams to Atlas, see 
   :mms-docs:`Atlas Users and Teams </tutorial/manage-users/>`.

Network Security
----------------

MongoDB Realm uses `TLS 1.3 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8446>`__ to secure
all network requests to and from your application, including apps that connect
from a Realm SDK as well as queries and operations on a linked :term:`MongoDB
Atlas data source <linked cluster>`. The TLS certificate is pre-defined and
cannot be customized.

Firewall Configuration
----------------------

{+service+} only sends requests from the following IP addresses. You can
copy this list to an allowlist on your firewall:

.. code-block:: text

   13.236.189.10
   18.202.2.23
   18.210.66.32
   18.211.240.224
   18.213.24.164
   52.63.26.53
   54.203.157.107

IP Access List
--------------
{+service+} allows client requests from the enabled entries in the app’s
IP access list. Allowed requests will still use {+service-short+}'s authentication and
authorization rules. By default, your {+app+} allows access from any client.

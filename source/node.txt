=========================
MongoDB Realm Node.js SDK
=========================

The {+service+} Node.js SDK enables server-side
client applications to access data stored in local {+realms+}
and interact with {+backend+} services like Functions, MongoDB Data
Access, and authentication. The Node.js SDK supports both JavaScript and
TypeScript applications.

.. note::

   The Node.js SDK does not support JavaScript or TypeScript
   applications written for web browsers. For that use case, you should
   consider the :ref:`Web SDK <web-intro>`. For development in React
   Native, refer to the :ref:`React Native SDK <react-native-intro>`
   documentation.

Installation
------------

To learn how to add the {+service+} Node.js SDK library as a dependency
to your application, see :ref:`Install Realm for Node.js
<node-install>`.

Get Started
-----------

To get started quickly with some JavaScript or TypeScript code, see the :ref:`Quick Start
<node-client-quick-start>`.

The Realm Data Model
--------------------

You can store a wide variety of data within {+realms+} stored on your
client. With :term:`{+sync+}`, you can share updates to that data across
clients and {+atlas+}.

For information about the structure of data you can store in {+realms+},
see :ref:`Realms <node-realms>`, :ref:`Objects
<node-realm-objects>`, and :ref:`Relationships
<node-client-relationships>`.

To learn about the results returned from {+realm+} queries, see
:ref:`Collections <node-client-collections>`.

Work with Realm Database
------------------------

Once you have defined a data model for your application, you
need to be able to :ref:`write <node-realm-database-writes>` and
:ref:`read <node-realm-database-reads>` pieces of data to and from
your {+realm+}s.

To learn how to query for data in local {+realms+}, see
:ref:`Query Engine <node-client-query-engine>`.

For information about how to react to changes in {+realm+} data, see
:ref:`Notifications <node-client-notifications>`.

Work with MongoDB Realm
-----------------------

The Node.js SDK also connects your {+service-short+} client application
with your {+app+}'s backend services, including Functions, Services,
Webhooks, {+sync+}, and built-in third-party authentication.

To learn how to connect to a {+backend+} app to call
Functions, query data in an instance of {+atlas+}, and synchronize data
in {+realms+}, see :ref:`Call a Function <node-call-a-function>`.

To learn how to incorporate user authentication  within your {+backend+}
app, see :ref:`Authentication <node-authenticate>`.

To learn how to handle schema updates in your client application, see
:ref:`Migrations <node-client-migrations>`.

To learn how to query for data in MongoDB with the Node.js SDK, see :ref:`
MongoDB Data Access <node-mongodb-data-access>`.

Overview
--------

Realm's notification system allows you to watch for and
react to changes in your data.

Realm emits three kinds of notifications:

- :ref:`realm notifications <realm-notifications>` when the realm as a whole is changed;
- :ref:`collection notifications <collection-notifications>` when objects are changed, added, or removed; and
- :ref:`object notifications <object-notifications>` when a specific object is changed or removed.

.. _realm-notifications:

Realm Notifications
-------------------
You can register a notification handler on an entire realm.
The handler will react whenever any write transaction
involving that Realm is committed.

.. example::

   .. include:: /examples/Notifications/RealmNotification.rst

.. _collection-notifications:

Collection Notifications
------------------------
You can register a notification handler on a specific
collection within a realm. The handler receives a
description of changes since the last notification.
Specifically, this description consists of the indices of
objects that have been added, removed, or modified.

Realm emits an initial notification after retrieving the
collection. After that, Realm delivers collection
notifications asynchronously whenever a write transaction
adds, changes, or removes objects in the collection.

.. example::

   .. include:: /examples/Notifications/CollectionNotification.rst

.. _object-notifications:

Object Notifications
--------------------

You can register a notification handler on a specific object
within a realm. Realm will notify your handler:

- when the object is deleted, or
- when any of its managed properties change.

.. example::

   .. include:: /examples/Notifications/ObjectNotification.rst

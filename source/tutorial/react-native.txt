Overview
--------

MongoDB Realm provides a Node SDK that allows you to create a Mobile Application with
React Native. This tutorial illustrates the creation of a "Task Tracker" React Native
application that allows users to: 

- Sign in to their account with their email and password and sign out later.
- View, create, modify, and delete tasks.

This tutorial should take around 30 minutes.

.. note::

   :github:`repo <mongodb-university/realm-tutorial/tree/master/rn>` with ready-to-compile
   source code, then follow the instructions in README.md to get started. Don't forget to
   update the getRealmApp.js file with your {+app+} ID, which you can find in the {+ui+}.

Overview
--------

MongoDB Realm provides a Node SDK that allows you to create a Mobile
Application with React Native. This tutorial illustrates the creation of
a "Task Tracker" application that allows users to: 

- Register themselves with email and password.
- Sign in to their account with their email and password and sign out later.
- View, create, modify, and delete tasks.

This tutorial should take around 30 minutes.

-------
- You will learn how to model your data with :doc:`Realm Object Models </sync/configure-your-data-model>`
- You will learn how to register and sign in users with MongoDB Realm :doc:`Email/Password Auth provider </authentication/email-password>`
- You will learn how to :doc:`read </node/read>` and :doc:`write </node/writes>` data with Realm

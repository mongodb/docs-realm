Overview
--------

MongoDB Realm provides a Node SDK that allows you to create a Mobile Application with
React Native. This tutorial illustrates the creation of a "Task Tracker" React Native
application that allows users to: 

- Sign in to their account with their email and password and sign out later.
- View, create, modify, and delete tasks.

This tutorial should take around 30 minutes.

.. admonition:: Check Out the Quick Start
   :class: note
   
   If you prefer to explore on your own rather than follow a guided tutorial,
   check out the :ref:`React Native Quick Start
   <react-native-client-quick-start>`. It includes copyable code examples and
   the essential information that you need to set up a MongoDB Realm
   application.

Prerequisites
-------------

Ensure that you have the following:

- `nodejs <https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v10.x/>`_ version 10.x or later (including Node version 14)

- If you wish to run on iOS: `Xcode <https://developer.apple.com/xcode/>`__
  version 11.0 or higher, which requires macOS 10.14.4 or higher.

- If you wish to run on Android: `Android Studio
  <https://developer.android.com/studio>`_.

- :ref:`Set up the backend <tutorial-task-tracker-create-realm-app>`.

Define Data Access Permissions and Enable Sync
----------------------------------------------

The backend app is set up with an email/password authentication provider that we
can use to let users sign up and log in. Now, we need to define sync rules and
enable sync so that sync clients can read and write objects.

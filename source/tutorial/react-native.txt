Overview
--------

MongoDB Realm provides a Node SDK that allows you to create a Mobile Application with
React Native. This tutorial illustrates the creation of a "Task Tracker" React Native
application that allows users to: 

- Sign in to their account with their email and password and sign out later.
- View a list of projects they are a member of.
- View, create, modify, and delete tasks in projects.
- View a list of team members in their project.
- Add and remove team members to their project.

This tutorial should take around 30 minutes.

   application.

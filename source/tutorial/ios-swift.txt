Overview
--------

In :ref:`Part 1 <ios-swift-tutorial-local>` of this tutorial, you will
create a task tracker app that allows users to manage a personal list of
tasks stored in {+client-database+}. Once you've completed the local
version of the app, you can enhance your application in
:ref:`Part 2 <ios-swift-tutorial-sync>` with {+sync+} to:

- Register users with email and password.
- Sign users into accounts with email and password and sign out later.
- View a list of team members in a user's project.
- Add and remove team members to a user's project.
- View all projects a user is a member of and contribute tasks to those projects.

Part 1 should take around 30 minutes to complete. The optional part 2
should take an additional 30 minutes.

.. note:: Check Out the Quick Start
   
   If you prefer to explore on your own rather than follow a guided tutorial,
   check out the :ref:`iOS Quick Start <ios-client-quick-start-with-sync>`. It includes
   copyable code examples and the essential information that you need to set up
   a MongoDB Realm application.

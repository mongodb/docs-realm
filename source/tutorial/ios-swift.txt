Overview
--------

In this first phase of the tutorial, you will create a task
tracker app that allows users to:

- Register themselves with email and password.
- Sign in to their account with their email and password and sign out later.
- View, create, modify, and delete tasks.

This tutorial should take around 30 minutes.

.. admonition:: Check Out the Quick Start
   :class: note
   
   If you prefer to explore on your own rather than follow a guided tutorial,
   check out the :ref:`iOS Quick Start <ios-client-quick-start>`. It includes
   copyable code examples and the essential information that you need to set up
   a MongoDB Realm application.

.. admonition:: Download the Complete Source Code
   :class: note
   
   We host this tutorial application's :github:`complete and ready-to-compile
   source code <mongodb-university/realm-tutorial/tree/main/swift-ios>` on GitHub.
   Just follow the instructions in ``README.md`` to get started. Don't forget to
   update the ``AppDelegate.swift`` file with your App ID, which you can find in
   the {+ui+}.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- `Xcode <https://developer.apple.com/xcode/>`__ version 11.0 or higher, which requires macOS 10.14.4 or higher.
- Target of iOS 13.0.
- `CocoaPods <https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html>`__ 1.6.0 or later.
- :ref:`Set up the backend <tutorial-task-tracker-create-realm-app>`.

Define Data Access Permissions and Enable Sync
----------------------------------------------

The backend app is set up with an email/password authentication provider that we
can use to let users sign up and log in. Now, we need to define sync rules and
enable sync so that sync clients can read and write objects.

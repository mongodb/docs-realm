Overview
--------

In part 1 of this tutorial, you will create a task tracker app that
allows users to manage a personal list of tasks. Once you've completed
the app, you can enhance your application in part 2 with {+sync+} to:

- Register users with email and password.
- Sign users into accounts with email and password and sign out later.
- View a list of team members in a user's project.
- Add and remove team members to a user's project.
- View all projects a user is a member of and contribute tasks to those projects.

This tutorial should take around 30 minutes.

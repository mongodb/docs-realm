========================================
Set Up the Task Tracker Tutorial Backend
========================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you get started, you'll need a `{+atlas+}
<https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?tck=docs_realm>`_ account and
cluster. For details on how to create an account and set up a free
``M0`` cluster, see :atlas:`Get Started with Atlas </getting-started>`.

A. Create a MongoDB Realm App
-----------------------------

To begin, you need to create a new {+app+}. A {+app+} is a central,
server-side configuration that functions as the backend for your
application.

.. include:: /includes/steps/task-tracker-server-create-realm-app.rst

B. Define Your Data Model
-------------------------

In MongoDB Realm, all data conforms to schemas that you define. The types
described by these schemas make up your app's data model and are a key part of
data access and security. Realm uses your data model to generate GraphQL types
and operations as well as to validate reads and writes.

.. include:: /includes/steps/task-tracker-server-data-model.rst

C. Configure User Authentication
--------------------------------

Every request sent to Realm must come from an authenticated user, so we need to
have a way for users to create accounts and log in. For this app, we'll use
email/password authentication. Authenticating users has the additional benefit
of giving each user a persistent identity that we can associate with their tasks
in order to easily find and secure them.

.. include:: /includes/steps/task-tracker-server-auth.rst

D. Define an Authentication Trigger
-----------------------------------

We want each user to have a corresponding document in the ``users`` collection
that contains their information. We could create these documents manually for
every user, but that approach is prone to errors and adds complexity to your
client applications. Instead, we can use a trigger to automatically add a
document for each user when they register their account.

.. include:: /includes/steps/task-tracker-server-trigger.rst

E. Deploy Your App
------------------

At this point your Realm App is fully configured and almost ready to accept
requests from client applications. All that's left to do is to deploy the
fully configured app.

Click :guilabel:`Deploy` in the lefthand navigation and find the current draft
at the top of the deployment history table. Click the :guilabel:`Review & Deploy
Changes` button and review the diff to make sure that everything looks correct.
When you're ready to go live, click :guilabel:`Deploy`.

What's Next?
------------

You just built a functional task tracker application backend with MongoDB Realm.
Great job!

Now that you have a working Realm application, you can follow one of our client
application tutorials to connect to your Realm app and manage tasks from a
mobile or web application.

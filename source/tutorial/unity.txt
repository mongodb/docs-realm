Overview
--------

In this tutorial, you will create a Unity project that uses Unity's `Platformer
Microgame <https://learn.unity.com/project/2d-platformer-template>`_  and {+service+}.

The project is made up of two parts:

- The Platformer Microgame: A working microgame provided by Unity that does not store any data in a database 
- The Realm Tutorial repository: repository we've created to simplify creation of the User Interface, and storing of data in {+realm+}

In :ref:`Part 1 <unity-tutorial-local>` of this tutorial, you will set up the
platformer microgame, clone and import the client scripts, and then add
functionality to manage a local list of player stats in {+client-database+}.

Once you've completed the local version of the app, you can enhance your
application in :ref:`Part 2 <unity-tutorial-sync>`  {+sync+} to:

- Register users with email and password.
- Sign users into accounts with email and password and sign out later.
- Create a synced global leaderboard of top user scores.

Part 1 should take around 30 minutes to complete. The optional part 2 should take an additional 30 minutes.

.. note::

   you can check out the following documentation:

.. _unity-tutorial-sync:

Part 2: Add Sync to the Game (Optional)
---------------------------------------

.. important:: Prerequisites

   - Completed :ref:`Part 1 <unity-tutorial-local>`.
   - A :doc:`MongoDB Realm application </get-started/create-realm-app/>` with :doc:`Email/Passeword authentication enabled </authentication/email-password>`.

.. tip::

   To view a complete synced version of the app:

   1. Navigate to the root directory of the Realm Tutorial repository:

      .. code-block:: shell

         cd realm-tutorial-unity

   #. Check out the ``sync`` branch:

      .. code-block:: shell

         git checkout sync

   #. In Constants.cs, replace ``<your-realm-app-ID-here>`` with
      your {+service-short+} app ID, which you can
      :ref:`find in the Realm UI <find-your-app-id>`.

   #. Run the game by clicking the "Play" button in the top of the Unity UI to
   enter `Play mode <https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GameView.html>`_

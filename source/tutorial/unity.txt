Overview
--------

In this tutorial, you will create a Unity project that uses Unity's `Platformer
Microgame <https://learn.unity.com/project/2d-platformer-template>`_  and {+service+}.

In :ref:`Part 1 <unity-tutorial-local>` of this tutorial, you will download and
import the platformer microgame, and then add functionality to manage a personal
list of player scores in {+client-database+}.

Once you've completed the local version of the app, you can enhance your
application in :ref:`Part 2 <unity-tutorial-sync>`  {+sync+} to:

- Register users with email and password.
- Sign users into accounts with email and password and sign out later.
- Create a synced global leaderboard of top user scores.

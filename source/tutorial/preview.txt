Task Tracker App
----------------

When you complete the Task Tracker tutorial, you'll make a collaborative
task tracker app where users can keep track of tasks in solo and team projects. 

The UI may vary slightly depending on which frontend client you build. 
This walkthrough of the iOS Task Tracker demonstrates what users can do:

- Register or sign in with an email and password
- View a list of projects in which the user is a member
- Select a project to view its tasks
- Change task status to In Progress or Done
- Add new tasks
- Delete tasks
- Add team members to projects
- View team member projects
- View and manage tasks in team members' projects

Realm Architecture
------------------

This diagram demonstrates how data coming from one user's interactions flows
through the different components of the app. 

- The red flow shows what happens when a user, Alice, signs in to the app. 
  The frontend communicates to the backend, which handles 
  :ref:`authentication <users-and-authentication>`.
- The black flow follows the action of Alice updating a task. The frontend writes
  the update to the local {+client-database+} that sits on Alice's device. Then if the 
  device has an internet connection, the data goes to the {+app+} backend
  and the :ref:`{+atlas-short+} cluster <data-sources>`.

This second diagram demonstrates how the actions of two separate users with 
separate accounts and devices might interact in the Task Tracker. 

- The red flow happens first, showing Alice adding Bob to her project. Once Alice's device
  connects to the internet, this update is received by the {+app+} and 
  sent to Bob's device over the internet. At the end of the red flow, Bob has read 
  and write access to Alice's project. 
- The blue flow starts with Bob adding a task to Alice's project and reverses 
  through all the steps that the red flow went through, again requiring an internet 
  connection on both devices for the data to be consistent everywhere.

.. tip::
  The :term:`{+client-database+}` stores changes made on the device, until it can sync
  with the :term:`{+app+}`. When the device has an active internet connection, it
  syncs changes with the backend. When an offline device connects to the internet, 
  it uploads and downloads any changesets. The user can then see changes that other 
  users made while they were offline. :ref:`{+sync+} <sync>` handles this process. 

What We Cover in this Tutorial
------------------------------

In building the Task Tracker, you will take advantage of some of the 
built-in :ref:`Functions <functions>` available in 
:ref:`{+service-short+} <realm-cloud>` and the functionality of 
:ref:`{+sync+} <sync>`. Once your {+backend-short+} backend is set up, you 
will combine it with the frontend of your choice to complete the app. 

This tutorial will guide you through: 

- Creating a {+atlas-short+} cluster to store your app's data in the cloud
- Setting up an {+app+} (the backend)
- Setting up authentication through the {+ui+}.
- Using {+sync+} so you can have locally stored data on each device that 
  syncs up with the data on your {+atlas-short+} cluster when the device has internet.
- Creating a frontend that works with the {+service-short+} infrastructure you have created

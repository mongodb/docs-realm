Overview
--------

In this first phase of the tutorial, you will create a task
tracker app that allows users to:

- Register themselves with email and password.
- Sign in to their account with their email and password and sign out later.
- View, create, modify, and delete tasks.

This tutorial should take around 30 minutes.

.. note::
   
   Want to get started right away with the complete source
   code? Check out our :github:`repo
   <mongodb-university/realm-tutorial>` with
   ready-to-compile source code, then follow the instructions
   in README.md to get started. Don't forget to update the
   application ``build.gradle`` file with your {+app+} ID, which you
   can find in the {+ui+}.

Prerequisites

- `Android Studio <https://developer.android.com/studio>`__ version 4.0 or higher.

Overview
--------

Realm provides a .NET SDK that allows you to create a multi-platform 
mobile application with Xamarin and C#. This tutorial illustrates the creation 
of a "Task Tracker" application that allows users to: 

- Register their email as a new user account.
- Sign in to their account with their email and password (and sign out later).
- View a list of projects they are a member of.
- View, create, modify, and delete tasks in projects.
- View a list of team members in their project.
- Add and remove team members to their project.

This tutorial should take around 30 minutes.

.. note:: Check Out the Quick Start
   
   If you prefer to explore on your own rather than follow a guided tutorial,
   check out the :ref:`.NET Quick Start <dotnet-client-quick-start>`. It includes 
   copyable code examples and the essential information that you need to set up 
   an Atlas App Services backend.

Prerequisites
-------------

1. Ensure that you have the following software installed by selecting the tab for 
   your development environment:

   .. tabs::

      .. tab:: MacOS
         :tabid: vs-mac

         - `Visual Studio for Mac <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/>`__ 2019.
         - `Xcode <https://developer.apple.com/xcode/>`_ 10.0 or newer. Note that 
               Xcode 10 requires macOS High Sierra (10.13) or newer.
         - `iOS 12 SDK <https://developer.apple.com/ios/>`_.
         - `Android 6.0 / API level 23 <https://developer.android.com/studio>`_.

      .. tab:: Windows
         :tabid: vs-win

         - Windows 7 or newer. Windows 10 recommended. 
         - `Visual Studio <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/>`_ 2017 
               (Visual Studio 2019 is recommended)
         - `Android 6.0 / API level 23 <https://developer.android.com/studio>`_.
         - To build iOS projects on Windows, you will also need a Mac computer, 
               network-accessible from the Windows computer, that 
               conforms to the minimum requirements for running Xamarin on macOS.

2. Also, ensure that you have completed the tutorial to 
   :ref:`Set up the backend <tutorial-task-tracker-create-realm-app>`.

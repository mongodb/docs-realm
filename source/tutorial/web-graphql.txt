   :class: singlecol

.. note:: Check Out the Quick Start
   
   If you prefer to explore on your own rather than follow a guided tutorial,
   check out the :ref:`Web Quick Start <web-quick-start>`. It includes copyable
   code examples and the essential information that you need to set up a MongoDB
   Realm application.

In this tutorial, you'll build a functional web application backed by the
Realm GraphQL API. The app uses :reactjs:`React <>` to define UI
components and :apollo:`Apollo Client <docs/react>` to run queries and mutations
through the GraphQL API. We've already created most of the frontend application
for you, so you don't need to know React to follow along.

The app is a task tracker that allows users to:

- Register and log in with an email/password account.
- View a list of their projects. 
- Add, view, and delete tasks for projects they are a member of.
- Switch tasks between Open, In Progress, and Complete statuses
- Add, view, and remove team members from projects.

This tutorial should take around 30 minutes.


.. note:: Reacting to database updates 

   The Realm Web SDK does not support :ref:`sync <sync>`, so the app you'll
   build in this tutorial uses other means to get live updates on data changes 
   from the backend. However, data that you create from the web app will automatically sync to any of the
   other :ref:`task tracker tutorial apps <tutorial>` that use Realm Database.

   This tutorial covers two ways to synchronize data from the server to the Web SDK:

   - The ``watch()`` method as used in the :ref:`Implement the Project List<web-tutorial-implement-the-project-list>` section.
   - :apollo:`Apollo GraphQL client polling <docs/react/data/queries/#polling>` as used 
     in the :ref:`Define the GraphQL Schema & Operations<define-the-graphql-schema-and-operations>` section. 

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you get started, you'll need the following:

- A Template App in App Services. To learn more about the Template Apps, and to 
  install the Template App that this tutorial uses in the Atlas App Services UI,
  see :ref:`<template-applications>`. 

- :nodejs:`Node.js <>` installed on your machine.

- `git <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>`__
  installed on your machine.

Once you're set up with these prerequisites, you're ready to start the tutorial.

A. Clone the Client App Repository
----------------------------------

We've already put together a task tracker browser application that has most of
the frontend code you'll need. You can clone the client application repository
directly from GitHub:

.. code-block:: shell
   
   git clone --branch start https://github.com/mongodb-university/realm-tutorial-web.git

In your terminal, run the following commands to navigate to the task tracker
client application and install its dependencies:

.. code-block:: shell
   
   cd realm-tutorial-web
   npm install

.. tip::
 
   The ``start`` branch is an incomplete version of the app that we will
   complete in this tutorial. To view the finished app, check out the
   ``final`` branch and update ``src/App.js`` with your :ref:`Realm app
   ID <find-your-app-id>`.

B. Explore the App Structure & Components
-----------------------------------------

The web client is a standard React web application written in JavaScript and
scaffolded with `Create React App
<https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/>`__. We encourage you to explore
the files in the app for a few minutes before you continue the tutorial. This
will help you to familiarize yourself with what the app contains and where
you'll be working.

The project uses the following file structure:

.. include:: /includes/task-tracker-web-client-base-file-structure.rst

Apollo Client & GraphQL Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``/src/graphql`` directory contains all of the modules that you'll use to
configure the Apollo GraphQL client and connect to your Realm app's GraphQL API.
These files are only incomplete scaffolds - some are blank and others require
you to make some modifications. This tutorial walks through adding the missing
code in these files to connect the task tracker app to Realm.

React Components & Hooks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``/src/components`` directory contains pre-built React components and hooks
that handle local state management and UI rendering. The components import code
from the files in ``/src/graphql`` and use them to interact with Realm. We've
already completely implemented the UI portions, so you won't need to add any
React-specific code to these files. We'll make sure to show you along the way
how to modify the components and hooks to use the Realm GraphQL API.

.. note:: React Components

   React is a `popular
   <https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-web-frameworks>`__
   modern web application framework that uses a component model to maintain
   application state and intelligently render pieces of the UI. If you're not
   familiar with React or want to brush up on your knowledge, check out the
   `official React website <https://reactjs.org>`_, which has excellent
   documentation and tutorials.

C. Connect to Your Atlas App Services Backend
---------------------------------------------

The client app needs to connect to your App Services backend so that users can
register and log in. In ``src/RealmApp.js``, we import the Realm Web SDK to
connect to Atlas and handle these actions. The file exports a React context
provider that encapsulates this behavior and makes it available to other
components in the app.

Some of the functionality in ``RealmApp.js`` is not fully defined. You need to
update the code to use the SDK to connect to your App Services backend and
handle user authentication.

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Create a Realm App Client

      The app client is the primary interface to your Realm app from the SDK. In
      ``src/App.js``, replace ``"TODO"`` with your Realm App ID:

      .. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/code/final/App.snippet.appID.js
         :caption: src/App.js
         :language: javascript

      .. note:: Use Your App ID

         Make sure to replace ``"TODO"`` with your app's unique
         :guilabel:`App ID`. You can find your :guilabel:`App ID` by clicking the
         copy button next to the name of your app in the lefthand navigation of the
         Realm UI.

         .. figure:: /images/task-tracker-web-copy-appid.png
            :alt: The copy app id button in the UI


   .. step:: Complete the Registration & Authentication Functions

      The app client provides methods that allow you to authenticate and register
      users through the email/password authentication provider. In
      ``src/RealmApp.js``, the ``RealmAppProvider`` component wraps these functions
      and keeps the app client in sync with local React state.

      These wrapping functions already have the state update calls but don't
      currently use the app client you created. You need to update the functions to
      actually call the SDK authentication and registration methods.

      .. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/code/final/RealmApp.snippet.realmAppProvider.js
         :caption: src/RealmApp.js
         :language: javascript

.. example:: How We Use It
   
   In ``src/App.js``, we use the ``useRealmApp()`` hook to determine
   when the main application is ready to render. We also check for an
   authenticated user and always render exclusively the login screen unless a
   user is logged in. This guarantees that only authenticated users can access
   the rest of the app.
   
   .. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/code/final/App.snippet.requireLoggedInUser.js
      :caption: src/App.js
      :language: javascript

In ``/components/LoginScreen.js``, we use the wrapped authentication methods
that you defined to log user in and register new users.

Find the the ``handleLogin`` function and add the following code to process a 
``emailPassword`` credential by calling the ``logIn()`` method. 

.. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/code/final/LoginScreen.snippet.handleLogin.js
   :caption: src/components/LoginScreen.js
   :language: javascript

Next, find the ``handleRegistrationAndLogin`` function and add the following code 
to create a ``emailPassword`` credential.

.. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/code/final/LoginScreen.snippet.handleRegistrationAndLogin.js
   :caption: src/components/LoginScreen.js
   :language: javascript

.. _define-the-graphql-schema-and-operations: 

D. Define the GraphQL Schema & Operations
-----------------------------------------

A GraphQL schema defines all of the types, enums, and scalars that a GraphQL API
supports. Realm automatically generates a GraphQL schema for you that includes
definitions for your :ref:`schema types <schema-types>` as well as a set of CRUD
query and mutation resolvers for each type.

.. tip:: Generated TypeScript Types
   
   You can use `graphql-codegen <https://graphql-code-generator.com/>`__ to
   generate TypeScript types based on your app's GraphQL schema.

Open ``src/graphql/useTaskQueries.js``, and find the ``TODO`` for ``const GetAllTasksQuery``. 
Here you define the query to get all tasks from the database.

Fill in the code with the following query: 

.. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/code/final/useTaskQueries.snippet.GetAllTasksQuery.js
     :caption: src/graphql/useTaskQueries.js
     :language: javascript

Now that you've defined the query, you need to create the hook to call it in the application. 
We're going to define a lightweight wrapper around Apollo's :apollo:`useQuery() <docs/react/data/queries/#usequery-api>`.
In our hook, we'll pass the project as a dynamic variable to the query. We'll also
set the query to refresh every 1000 milliseconds with the Apollo :apollo:`startPolling() <docs/react/data/queries/#startpolling>` function
so that the data doesn't get stale if another team member adds tasks to the project.
We also must call the :apollo:`stopPolling() <docs/react/data/queries/#stoppolling>` function
when the component unmounts, so there isn't a memory leak.

Fill in the code: 

.. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/code/final/useTaskQueries.snippet.useAllTasksInProject.js
     :caption: src/graphql/useTaskQueries.js
     :language: javascript

.. note:: Polling and Billing

   Every poll request counts as a Realm Request for billing purposes. Refer to the
   :ref:`Billing documentation <billing-requests>` for more information.

   Using the :ref:`collection.watch() <web-mongodb-watch>` method as is done in the
   :ref:`Implement the Project List<web-tutorial-implement-the-project-list>` section
   can be more cost effective for queries that receive a high volume of requests.

Now that we've defined the query to fetch tasks by project, we have to define our mutations.

Open ``src/graphql/useTaskMutations.js`` and find the ``TODO`` mutation
definitions. These are all of the mutations that the app uses to create and
modify ``User`` and ``Task`` documents.

Fill in the code with the following mutation definitions:

* ``AddTaskMutation``

  .. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/code/final/useTaskMutations.snippet.addTaskMutation.js
     :caption: src/graphql/useTaskMutations.js
     :language: javascript

* ``UpdateTaskMutation``

  .. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/code/final/useTaskMutations.snippet.updateTaskMutation.js
     :caption: src/graphql/useTaskMutations.js
     :language: javascript

* ``DeleteTaskMutation``

  .. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/code/final/useTaskMutations.snippet.deleteTaskMutation.js
     :caption: src/graphql/useTaskMutations.js
     :language: javascript

Now that you've defined the mutations, you need to call them in their respective
hooks. The mutation hooks are lightweight wrappers around Apollo's
:apollo:`useMutation() <docs/react/data/mutations/#usemutation-api>` hook that
allow you to pass dynamic variables to the queries.

In ``src/graphql/useTaskMutations.js`` file, find the following functions below
your mutation definitions and update them to execute their respective mutations: 

* ``useAddTask``

  .. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/code/final/useTaskMutations.snippet.useAddTask.js
     :caption: src/graphql/useTaskMutations.js
     :language: javascript

* ``useUpdateTask``

  .. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/code/final/useTaskMutations.snippet.useUpdateTask.js
     :caption: src/graphql/useTaskMutations.js
     :language: javascript

* ``useDeleteTask``

  .. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/code/final/useTaskMutations.snippet.useDeleteTask.js
     :caption: src/graphql/useTaskMutations.js
     :language: javascript

E. Connect Apollo to the GraphQL API
------------------------------------

You've defined GraphQL CRUD operations and created custom query mutation hooks
for tasks. However, these hooks must be wrapped in an Apollo context provider
that makes an ``ApolloClient`` object available.

In ``src/graphql/RealmApolloProvider.js``, we export a React component that
provides the ``ApolloClient`` object but the function that instantiates the
client is incomplete. You need to update the file to create a client that can
connect to your app's GraphQL API.

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Instantiate an ApolloClient

      The ``RealmApolloProvider`` component should call
      ``createRealmApolloClient()`` to instantiate the client. Update the
      component with the following code to create an ``ApolloClient`` object that
      connects to your app:

      .. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/code/final/RealmApolloProvider.snippet.realmApolloProvider.js
         :caption: src/graphql/RealmApolloProvider.js
         :language: javascript


   .. step:: Authenticate GraphQL Requests

      The ``createRealmApolloClient()`` function now instantiates a client object, but
      you won't be able to run any GraphQL queries or mutations just yet. Every
      GraphQL request must include an Authorization header that specifies a valid
      user access token. The current client does not include any Authorization
      headers, so all requests it makes will fail.

      To fix this, update the ``createRealmApolloClient()`` function to include the
      current user's access token in an Authorization header with every request:

      .. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/code/final/RealmApolloProvider.snippet.createRealmApolloClient.js
         :caption: src/graphql/RealmApolloProvider.js
         :language: javascript


.. _web-tutorial-implement-the-project-list:

F. Implement the Projects List
------------------------------

As defined by our data model, a ``Project`` is an embedded object inside
of a ``User`` document. This means that we can use :ref:`custom user data
<custom-user-data>` to access a given user's list of projects
directly from their ``Realm.User`` object.

To  update the app if other users add the current user to their project, we use the 
:ref:`collection.watch() <web-mongodb-watch>` method. 

In the file ``/graphql/useProjects.js``, add the following code to retrieve the
current user's projects:

.. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/code/final/useProjects.snippet.useProjects.js
   :caption: src/graphql/useProjects.js
   :language: javascript

G. Use Realm functions
----------------------

The file ``src/components/EditPermissionsModal.js`` defines a hook named
``useTeamMembers()`` that returns a list of the current user's team members. It
should also return functions that add and remove team members, but you'll need
to define them. The :ref:`task tracker backend application
<tutorial-task-tracker-create-realm-app>` already defines server-side
:ref:`Atlas Functions <functions>` that handle the logic, so you
just need to call them.

.. tip::
   
   You can call your app's Functions by name as asynchronous
   methods on the ``User.functions`` object. All function calls return a
   ``Promise``. For example, to call a function named ``myFunction`` as the
   current user, you would write ``await app.currentUser.functions.myFunction()``.

Update the ``useTeamMembers()`` hook's return object to include
``addTeamMember()`` and ``removeTeamMember()`` helper functions that accept an
email address and pass it their respective server-side functions:

.. literalinclude:: /tutorial/generated/code/final/EditPermissionsModal.snippet.useTeamMembers.js
   :caption: src/components/EditPermissionsModal.js
   :language: javascript

H. Try It Out Locally
---------------------

The task tracker app is now fully configured so you can start it up to start
tracking tasks.

Start the App
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To start the app, navigate to the project root in your shell and then enter the
following command:

.. code-block:: shell
   
   npm run start

If the app starts successfully, you should see output that resembles the
following:

.. code-block:: shell
   
   Compiled successfully!
   
   You can now view task-tracker in the browser.
   
     Local:            http://localhost:3000
     On Your Network:  http://191.175.1.124:3000

Open your browser to http://localhost:3000 to access the app.

If the app builds successfully, here are some things you can try in the app:

- Create a user with email *first@example.com*
- Explore the app, then log out or launch a second instance of the app in an incognito browser window
- Create another user with email *second@example.com*	  
- Navigate to *second@example.com*'s project
- Add, update, and remove some tasks	  
- Click "Manage Team"
- Add *first@example.com* to your team
- Log out and log in as *first@example.com*
- See two projects in the projects list
- Navigate to *second@example.com*'s project
- Collaborate by adding, updating, and removing some new tasks

I. Deploy the App
-----------------

Now that you've validated that the app is working, it's time to deploy the app. 
In this section, you're going to create a production build with `Create React App's build script <https://create-react-app.dev/docs/production-build/>`__ 
and deploy the app to be hosted with :ref:`Realm Static Hosting <static-hosting>`.

Create the Production Bundle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create your production bundle, run the command: 

.. code-block:: shell
   
   npm run build

Once the build finishes, validate it's working by running:

.. code-block:: shell
   
   npx serve -s build

You will see a new browser window pop up running the app on ``localhost:5000``. The app should 
look and behave the same as the development version you made in the previous step. 

You can find the production bundle's code with your repository in a newly generated folder ``build``.

.. _deploy-web-app-realm-ui:

Deploy Using the Realm UI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, navigate to the **Hosting** section of the Realm UI. You can find it on the side menu under **Manage**. 
Once you're on the Hosting page, click the **Enable Hosting** button. 

Now that you have hosting enabled, replace the default ``index.html`` with the production 
bundle you built in the last step. Delete the ``index.html`` file by clicking the check 
box next to the file and then **Actions > Delete**. 

To add your app, open a file browser on your computer, and navigate to the ``build`` 
folder in your app's root folder. Select all the ``build`` folder's contents, and 
drag and drop it over to the Realm Hosting UI's Files page. 

Once the files finish uploading, click the **Review & Deploy** button at the top of the page. 
A dialog will open with your changes. Review the changes and click the **Deploy** button
at the bottom of the dialogue to start the deployment of your app.

Realm deploys your site to ``<Your-App-Id>.mongodbstitch.com``. 
Deployment can take up to a few minutes. You can track the status on the Hosting page. 

Once deployment finishes, navigate to your app's new URL, ``<Your-App-Id>.mongodbstitch.com``. 
Here you'll find the app with the same backend and data that you were working with 
before, now live on the Internet!

For more detailed information about hosting your web app with Realm, refer to our documentation 
on :ref:`hosting a single page application <host-a-single-page-application>`.

.. _deploy-web-app-realm-cli:

.. note:: Deploy Using the Realm CLI

   You can also deploy the app frontend with the Realm CLI. 
   Before you're able to deploy the frontend from the Realm CLI, you must first 
   enable hosting in the Realm UI, as discussed at the beginning of the 
   :ref:`Deploy Using the Realm UI <deploy-web-app-realm-ui>` section. 

   Once you've enabled hosting in the UI, you need to have the `realm-tutorial-backend <https://github.com/mongodb-university/realm-tutorial-backend>`_ 
   repository handy, which you used in :ref:`the backend setup <tutorial-task-tracker-create-realm-app>`.
   
   In the **backend** directory, create the folder ``hosting/files``. This is where 
   you will place your assets for Realm Hosting. 

   Also create a config file for the app. This should be located at ``hosting/config.json``, 
   and have the following contents: 

   .. code-block:: json
      
      {
         "enabled": true,
         "default_response_code": 200,
         "default_error_path": "/index.html",
      }

   Copy the contents of the ``build`` folder from the realm-tutorial-web directory  
   to the ``hosting/files`` folder in the backend. You can do this with the command:

   .. code:: shell
      
      cp -a path/to/realm-tutorial-web/build/. path/to/realm-tutorial-backend/hosting/files

   Now you're ready to deploy the app using the Realm CLI. To deploy, run the 
   command: 

   .. code:: shell
      
      realm-cli push --remote=<Your-App-Id> --include-hosting

   Realm then deploys your site to ``<Your-App-Id>.mongodbstitch.com``.  

What's Next?
------------

You just built and deployed a functional task tracker web application built with MongoDB
Realm. Great job!

Now that you have some hands-on experience with App Services, consider these
options to keep practicing and learn more:

- Extend the task tracker app with additional features. For example, you could:
  
  - allow users to log in using another :ref:`authentication provider <authentication-providers>`

- Follow another tutorial to build a mobile app for the task tracker. We have
  task tracker tutorials for the following platforms:
  
  - :doc:`iOS (Swift) </tutorial/swiftui>`
  - :doc:`Android (Kotlin) </tutorial/java-sdk>`
  - :doc:`React Native (JavaScript) </tutorial/react-native>`
  - :doc:`Node.js (JavaScript) CLI </tutorial/nodejs-cli>`

- Use the Realm CLI to automate deploying your frontend application.

- Dive deeper into the docs to learn more about App Services. You'll find
  information and guides on features like:
  
  - Serverless :ref:`functions <functions>` that handle backend logic and
    connect your app to external services. You can call functions from a
    client app, either directly or as a :ref:`custom GraphQL resolver
    <graphql-custom-resolvers>`.
  
  - :ref:`Triggers <triggers>` and :ref:`HTTPS endpoints <https-endpoints>`,
    which automatically call functions in response to events as they occur. You
    can define :ref:`database triggers <database-trigger>` which
    respond to changes in your data, :ref:`authentication triggers
    <authentication-triggers>` which respond to user management and
    authentication events, and :ref:`scheduled triggers
    <scheduled-trigger>` which run on a fixed schedule.

  - Built-in :ref:`authentication providers <authentication-providers>` and
    and user management tools. You can allow users to log in through multiple
    methods, like API keys and Google OAuth, and associate :ref:`custom data
    <custom-user-data>` with every user.

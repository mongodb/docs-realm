.. admonition:: Check Out the Quick Start
   :class: note
   
   If you prefer to explore on your own rather than follow a guided tutorial,
   check out the :ref:`Web Quick Start <web-quick-start>`. It includes copyable
   code examples and the essential information that you need to set up a MongoDB
   Realm application.

In this tutorial, you'll build a functional web application backed by the
{+service+} GraphQL API. The app uses :reactjs:`React <>` to define UI
components and :apollo:`Apollo Client <doc/react>` to run queries and mutations
through the GraphQL API. We've already created most of the frontend application
for you, so you don't need to know React to follow along.

The app is a task tracker that allows users to:

- Register and log in with an email/password account.
- Add, view, and delete tasks.
- Switch tasks between Open, In Progress, and Complete statuses

This tutorial should take around 30 minutes.

.. admonition:: Realm Web SDK and Sync
   :class: important
   
   The Realm Web SDK does not support :ref:`sync <sync-overview>`, so the app
   you'll build in this tutorial won't update in real time when data changes.
   However, data that you create from the web app will automatically sync to any
   of the other :ref:`task tracker tutorial apps <tutorial>` that use Realm
   Database.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you get started, you'll need the following:

- A complete task tracker app in MongoDB Realm. If you haven't yet completed
  :doc:`Set Up the Task Tracker Tutorial Backend </tutorial/realm-app>`, do
  that before you continue.

- :nodejs:`Node.js <>` installed on your machine.

- `git <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>`__
  installed on your machine.

Once you're set up with these prerequisites, you're ready to start the tutorial.

.. admonition:: Download the Complete Source Code
   :class: note
   
   We host this tutorial application's :github:`complete and ready-to-run source
   code <mongodb-university/realm-tutorial/tree/main/web>` on GitHub. You can
   use it to check your work or download it to run the app locally.

   To get started, follow the instructions in ``README.md``. Don't forget to
   update the ``/src/realm/RealmApp.tsx`` file with your App ID, which you can
   find in the {+ui+}.

A. Define Data Access Permissions
---------------------------------

.. admonition:: Non-Sync Permissions
   :class: important
   
   The permissions in this step only apply if you do not enable sync for the
   application. Sync permissions use a different rules system and override any
   non-sync permissions when sync is enabled. If you plan to or have already
   used the task tracker backend from one of the frontend apps that support
   sync, then you can skip this section in favor of the sync permissions
   described on the sync app's tutorial page.
   
   The Realm Web SDK and GraphQL API do not use sync, so if you only intend to
   build a web client then use these rules.

The backend app is set up with an email/password authentication provider that we
can use to let users sign up and log in and an automatically generated GraphQL
API that we can use work with data.

By default, however, all GraphQL queries from a client application will fail.

To allow users to read and write data, you must first define data access rules
that determine whether a given user has read or write permissions for a given
document.

You define non-sync data access rules for your GraphQL API on the
:guilabel:`Rules` screen of the Realm UI.

.. include:: /includes/steps/task-tracker-server-rules.rst

B. Clone the Client App Repository
----------------------------------

We've already put together a task tracker browser application that has most of
the frontend code you'll need. You can clone client application repository
directly from GitHub:

.. code-block:: shell
   
   git clone git@github.com:mongodb-university/realm-tutorial.git

In your terminal, run the following commands to navigate to the task tracker
client application and install its dependencies:

.. code-block:: shell
   
   cd realm-tutorial/web
   npm install

The ``main`` branch is a finished version of the app as it should look after
you complete this tutorial. To remove the Realm-specific source code that you'll
define in this tutorial, check out the ``todo`` branch:

.. code-block:: shell
   
   git checkout todo

.. note::

   The ``realm-tutorial`` repo contains task tracker client applications for
   multiple platforms. The project root for this tutorial is located in the
   ``web`` subdirectory.

C. Explore the App Structure & Components
-----------------------------------------

The web client is a standard React web application written in
:typescript:`TypeScript <>` and scaffolded with `create-react-app
<https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/>`__. We encourage you to explore
the files in the app for a few minutes before you continue the tutorial. This
will help you to familiarize yourself with what the app contains and where
you'll be working.

The project uses the following file structure:

.. include:: /includes/task-tracker-web-client-base-file-structure.rst

Realm & Apollo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``/src/realm`` directory contains all of the modules that you'll use to
connect the application to Realm. These files are only incomplete scaffolds -
some are blank and others require you to make some modifications. This tutorial
walks through adding the missing code in these files to connect the task tracker
app to Realm.

React Components & Hooks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``/src/components`` and ``/src/hooks`` directories contain pre-built React
components and hooks that handle local state management and UI rendering. The
components import code from the files in ``/src/realm`` and use them to interact
with Realm. We've already completely implemented these so you won't need to add
any code to these files. We'll make sure to show you along the way how these
components and hooks use the code that you write.

.. admonition:: React Components
   :class: note

   React is a `popular
   <https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-web-frameworks>`__
   modern web application framework that uses a component model to maintain
   application state and intelligently render pieces of the UI. If you're not
   familiar with React or want to brush up on your knowledge, check out the
   `official React website <https://reactjs.org>`_, which has excellent
   documentation and tutorials.

D. Connect to Your MongoDB Realm App
------------------------------------

The client app needs to connect to your Realm app so that users can register and
log in. In ``src/realm/RealmApp.tsx``, we import the Realm Web SDK to connect to
Realm and handle these actions. The file exports a React context provider that
encapsulates this behavior and makes it available to other components in the
app.

Some of the functionality in ``RealmApp.tsx`` is not fully defined. You need to
update the code to use the SDK to connect to your Realm app and handle user
authentication.

.. include:: /includes/steps/task-tracker-web-realmapp.rst

.. admonition:: How We Use It
   :class: admonition-example
   
   In ``/components/App.tsx``, we use the ``useRealmApp()`` hook to determine
   when the main application is ready to render. We also check for an
   authenticated user and always render exclusively the login screen unless a
   user is logged in. This guarantees that only authenticated users can access
   the rest of the app.
   
   .. code-block:: typescript
      :copyable: false
      :emphasize-lines: 2, 3, 6
      
      function RequireAuthentication() {
        const app = useRealmApp();
        if (!app) {
          return <div>Loading</div>;
        }
        return app.user ? (
          <RealmApolloProvider>
            <Board />
          </RealmApolloProvider>
        ) : (
          <LoginScreen />
        );
      }

   In ``/components/LoginScreen.tsx``, we use the wrapped authentication methods
   that you defined to log user in and register new users.
     
   .. code-block:: typescript
      :copyable: false
      :emphasize-lines: 4, 16

      const handleLogin = async () => {
        setError((e) => ({ ...e, password: undefined }));
        try {
          return await app.logIn(email, password);
        } catch (err) {
          handleAuthenticationError(err);
        }
      };
    
      const handleRegistrationAndLogin = async () => {
        const isValidEmailAddress = validator.isEmail(email);
        setError((e) => ({ ...e, password: undefined }));
        if (isValidEmailAddress) {
          try {
            // Register the user and, if successful, log them in
            await app.registerUser(email, password);
            return await handleLogin();
          } catch (err) {
            handleAuthenticationError(err);
          }
        } else {
          setError((err) => ({ ...err, email: "Email is invalid." }));
        }
      };

E. Define the GraphQL Schema & Operations
-----------------------------------------

.. include:: /includes/steps/task-tracker-web-graphql.rst

.. admonition:: How We Use It
   :class: admonition-example
   
   We import the generated types defined in ``/src/types.ts`` from multiple
   components throughout the app that need to use data from the GraphQL API. For
   example, in ``/src/components/TaskView.tsx`` we import the generated ``Task``
   type and use it to type the component's ``task`` prop.
   
   .. code-block:: typescript
      :caption: ``/src/components/TaskView.tsx``
      
      import { Task } from "../types";
      
      interface TaskViewProps {
        task: Task;
      }
      
      export function TaskView({ task }: TaskViewProps) {
        const { assignee, name } = task;
        const status = task.status as TaskStatus;
        ...
      }
   
   We use the custom Apollo hooks generated in ``/src/graphql-operations.ts``
   call the GraphQL API as part of the task actions defined in ``useTasks()``.
   
   .. code-block:: typescript
      :caption: ``/src/components/TaskView.tsx``
      :emphasize-lines: 13-17, 20-22
      
      import { GetAllTasksQuery } from "./../types";
      import {
        useGetAllTasksQuery,
        useAddTaskMutation,
        useUpdateTaskMutation,
        useDeleteTaskMutation,
      } from "./../graphql-operations";

      export function useTasks() {
        const [tasks, setTasks] = React.useState<Task[]>([]);
        
        // Query for Tasks
        const { loading } = useGetAllTasksQuery({ onCompleted: (data: GetAllTasksQuery) => {
          if(data?.tasks) {
            setTasks(data.tasks as Task[])
          }
        }});
        
        // Create Task Mutation Functions
        const [addTaskMutation] = useAddTaskMutation();
        const [updateTaskMutation] = useUpdateTaskMutation();
        const [deleteTaskMutation] = useDeleteTaskMutation();

        ...
      }
   
   The custom query and mutation hooks are lightweight wrappers around Apollo's
   ``useQuery()`` and ``useMutation()`` hooks. For example, you could define
   ``useAddTaskMutation()`` yourself with the following code:
   
   .. code-block:: typescript
      
      import { Task, TaskInsertInput } from "../types";
      import { useMutation } from "@apollo/client";
      import gql from 'graphql-tag';
      
      type AddTaskMutation = { task: Task };
      type AddTaskMutationVariables = { task: TaskInsertInput };
      function useAddTaskMutation() {
        return useMutation<AddTaskMutation, AddTaskMutationVariables>(gql`
          mutation AddTask($task: TaskInsertInput!) {
            task: insertOneTask(data: $task) {
              _id
              name
              status
              assignee {
                _id
                name
                image
              }
            }
          }
        `);
      }
   
   Later in the function, we use the functions returned from the mutation hooks
   to execute the mutations.

   .. code-block:: typescript
      :caption: ``/src/components/TaskView.tsx``
      :emphasize-lines: 5-14, 17
      
      export function useTasks() {
        ...
        
        const addTask = async (task: Task) => {
          const variables: AddTaskMutationVariables = {
            task: {
              status: task.status,
              name: task.name,
              _partition: "My Project",
            },
          };
          if(task.assignee) {
            variables.task.assignee = { link: task.assignee._id }
          }
          const currentTasks = [...tasks];
          try {
            const result = await addTaskMutation({ variables });
            const task = result.data?.task as Task;
            setTasks([...tasks, task]);
          } catch (err) {
            setTasks(currentTasks);
            throw new Error("Unable to add task");
          }
        };
      }

F. Connect Apollo to the GraphQL API
------------------------------------

We've defined GraphQL CRUD operations and used the code generator to create
custom query and mutation hooks. However, these hooks must be wrapped in an
Apollo context provider that makes an ``ApolloClient`` object available.

In ``src/realm/RealmApolloProvider.tsx``, we export a React component that
provides the ``ApolloClient`` object but the function that instantiates the
client is incomplete. You need to update the file to create a client that can
connect to your app's GraphQL API.

.. include:: /includes/steps/task-tracker-web-apollo.rst

Try It Out
----------

The task tracker app is now fully configured so you can start it up to start
tracking tasks.

Start the App
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To start the app, navigate to the project root in your shell and then enter the
following command:

.. code-block:: shell
   
   npm run start

If the app starts successfully, you should see output that resembles the
following:

.. code-block:: shell
   
   Compiled successfully!
   
   You can now view task-tracker in the browser.
   
     Local:            http://localhost:3000
     On Your Network:  http://191.175.1.124:3000

Open your browser to http://localhost:3000 to access the app.

Register a New User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You need to register a user account before you can log in and use the tracker.
On the login screen, click :guilabel:`Register one now` and enter the email
address and password that you want to log in with. This is just a sample app
that does not send any validation emails, so feel free to use a fake email
address and/or simple password.

.. cssclass:: bordered-figure
.. figure:: /images/task-tracker-web-register-user.png

Add Some Tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you register, the app automatically logs you in. You can now add tasks and
use the tracker. To add a task, click :guilabel:`Add Task` at the bottom of any
of the lists, enter a name in the draft task that appears, then click
:guilabel:`Add`.

.. cssclass:: bordered-figure
.. figure:: /images/task-tracker-web-add-task.png

Move Tasks Around
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can change the status of a task by dragging it between lists. You can also
click on a task to open a detailed view with buttons that change the task's
status and allow you to delete the task entirely.

.. cssclass:: bordered-figure
.. figure:: /images/task-tracker-web-move-task.png
   :width: 750px

Check Out the Logs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Whenever you add, update, or delete a task, the client app sends a GraphQL
request to Realm. You can see a history of requests on the :guilabel:`Logs` page
of the Realm UI. Each GraphQL log entry shows the operation, compute usage, and
rule evaluation summary.

What's Next?
------------

You just built a functional task tracker web application built with MongoDB
Realm. Great job!

Now that you have some hands-on experience with MongoDB Realm, consider these
options to keep practicing and learn more:

- Extend the task tracker app with additional features. For example, you could:
  
  - allow users to change a task's assignee
  - allow users to log in using another authentication provider
  - support multiple projects that each have their own set of tasks

- Follow another tutorial to build a mobile app for the task tracker. We have
  task tracker tutorials for the following platforms:
  
  - :doc:`iOS (Swift) </tutorial/ios-swift>`
  - :doc:`Android (Kotlin) </tutorial/android-kotlin>`
  - :doc:`React Native (JavaScript) </tutorial/react-native>`

- Dive deeper into the docs to learn more about MongoDB Realm. You'll find
  information and guides on features like:
  
  - Serverless :doc:`functions </functions>` that handle backend logic and
    connect your app to external services. You can call functions from a
    client app, either directly or as a :doc:`custom GraphQL resolver
    </graphql/custom-resolvers>`.
  
  - :doc:`Triggers </triggers>` and :ref:`incoming webhooks <service-webhooks>`,
    which automatically call functions in response to events as they occur. You
    can define :doc:`database triggers </triggers/database-triggers>` which
    respond to changes in your data, :doc:`authentication triggers
    </triggers/authentication-triggers>` which respond to user management and
    authentication events, and :doc:`scheduled triggers
    </triggers/scheduled-triggers>` which run on a fixed schedule.

  - Built-in :doc:`authentication providers </authentication/providers>` and
    and user management tools. You can allow users to log in through multiple
    methods, like API keys and Google OAuth, and associate :doc:`custom data
    </users/enable-custom-user-data>` with every user.

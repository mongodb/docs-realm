Overview
--------

In this tutorial, you will use Node.js to create a task
tracker command line interface (CLI) that allows users to:

- Register themselves with email and password.
- Sign in to their account with their email and password.
- View, create, modify, and delete tasks.
- Watch for changes to the Task collection and get notified in the terminal 
  window when a change occurs.

This tutorial should take around 30 minutes to complete.

.. admonition:: Check Out the Quick Start
   :class: note
   
   If you prefer to explore on your own rather than follow a guided tutorial,
   check out the :ref:`Quick Start <node-client-quick-start>`. It
   includes copyable code examples and the essential information that you need
   to set up a MongoDB Realm application.

.. admonition:: Download the Complete Source Code
   :class: note
   
   We host this tutorial application's :github:`complete and ready-to-compile
   source code <mongodb-university/realm-tutorial/tree/main/node-cli>` on
   GitHub. You will need to update the ``config.js`` file with your App ID, 
   which you can find in the {+ui+}.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- `Node.js <https://nodejs.org/en/download/>`_ installed.
- :ref:`Set up the backend <tutorial-task-tracker-create-realm-app>`.

Once you're set up with these prerequisites, you're ready to start the tutorial.

A. Define Data Access Permissions and Enable Sync
-------------------------------------------------

The backend app is set up with an email/password authentication provider that we
can use to let users sign up and log in. Now, we need to define sync rules and
enable sync so that sync clients can read and write objects.

.. include:: /includes/steps/task-tracker-enable-sync.rst

B. Clone the Client App Repository
----------------------------------

We've already put together a task tracker CLI application that has most of
the code you'll need. You can clone the client application repository
directly from GitHub:

.. code-block:: shell
   
   git clone git@github.com:mongodb-university/realm-tutorial.git

.. important::
   
   The ``main`` branch is a finished version of the app as it should look *after*
   you complete this tutorial. To walk through this tutorial, please check 
   out the ``todo`` branch:

   .. code-block:: shell
    
      git checkout todo

In your terminal, run the following commands to navigate to the task tracker
client application and install its dependencies:

.. code-block:: shell
   
   cd realm-tutorial/node-cli
   npm install

C. Explore the App Structure & Components
-----------------------------------------

The ``realm-tutorial`` repo contains task tracker client applications for
multiple platforms. The project root for this tutorial is located in the
``node-cli`` subdirectory. Open a text editor to explore the directory and 
files.

This application has a flat project structure: all of the files are in the root 
directory. In this tutorial, we'll be focusing on 4 files: ``config.js``, 
``users.js``, ``tasks.js``, and ``watch.js``. The other files provide the 
underlying structure for the CLI. The following table describes the role of 
each file in this project:

.. cssclass:: config-table
.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 85
   
   * - File
     - Purpose

   * - config.js
     - Provides a single location for configuration data. You will put your 
       Realm app ID here.
   
   * - index.js
     - The entry point for the app. Creates the Realm App that you app will use 
       throughout its lifecycle and displays the initial logon screen.
   
   * - main.js
     - Displays the main menu of choices.
   
   * - output.js
     - Responsible for displaying text in the terminal window.
   
   * - tasks.js
     - Handles all task-related communication between the CLI and Realm. The 
       methods for listing, creating, editing, and deleting tasks live here.
   
   * - schemas.js
     - Contains the schema definitions for the collections used in this project.

   * - users.js
     - Handles Realm user authentication, including logging in, registering a 
       new user, and logging out.

   * - watch.js
     - Adds a listener to a Realm collection to notify the user when a change 
       occurs.

D. Connect to Your MongoDB Realm App
------------------------------------

To get the app working with your backend, you first need to add your Realm App ID 
to the ``config.js`` file. The ``config.js`` module exports a single property, 
``realmAppId``, which is currently set to "TODO":

.. code-block:: js

   exports.realmAppId = "TODO";

Change this value to your Realm App ID. 

.. note::

   To learn how to find your MongoDB Realm ``appId``, read the :doc:`Find
   Your App Id </get-started/find-your-app-id>` doc.

Once you have made that change, you now need to complete the code needed to 
open a {+realm+}. In ``index.js``, find the ``openRealm`` function. It will look 
like this:

.. code-block:: js

   async function openRealm() {
      const config = {
         schema: [schemas.TaskSchema, schemas.UserSchema, schemas.ProjectSchema],
         sync: {
            user: users.getAuthedUser(),
            partitionValue: "My Project",
         },
      };
      // TODO: open a realm with these configuration settings.
   }

Replace the ``TODO`` line with a line of code that opens a {+realm+} and assigns 
it to the ``realm`` property:

.. code-block:: js

   realm = Realm.open(config);

At this point, your app is pointing to your backend and opens a connection 
to it when you start the app. However, users cannot yet log in, so let's update 
that code next.

E. Enable authentication
------------------------

In the ``users.js`` file, we have a ``logIn`` function that prompts the user for 
an email address and password, and then, within a try-catch block, creates an 
:js-sdk:`emailPassword <Realm.App.html#Realm.Credentials.html#.emailPassword>` 
credential and passes it to the Realm 
:js-sdk:`logIn() <Realm.App.html#logIn>` method. 

Find the following comment:

.. code-block:: js

    // TODO: create new emailPassword credentials and call app.logIn(...)

And add the following code to create a ``emailPassword`` credential:

.. code-block:: js

    const credentials = Realm.Credentials.emailPassword(
      input.email,
      input.password
    );

Immediately below this, add the following code to call the 
``logIn()`` method:

.. code-block:: js

    const user = await app.logIn(credentials);


F. Implement the CRUD methods
-----------------------------

In the ``tasks.js`` file, there are a number of functions to handle typical  
CRUD functionality: ``getTasks``, ``getTask``, ``createTask``, ``deleteTask``, 
``editTask``, and ``changeStatus``. Each of these functions (except ``getTasks``) 
prompts the user for input and then makes the appropriate call to Realm. Your 
job is to implement the calls to {+service-short+}. The following list provides 
guidance on how to complete this task for each function:

* ``getTasks``

  To get all objects, call the :js-sdk:`objects() <Realm.html#objects>` method 
  and pass in the name of the collection:
  
  .. code-block:: js
     
     const tasks = realm.objects("Task");


* ``getTask``
  
  In the Tasks collection, a task's ``id`` field is the primary key, so 
  we call the :js-sdk:`objectForPrimaryKey() <Realm.html#objectForPrimaryKey>`  
  function to get a task by its Id.

  .. code-block:: js
     
     let result = realm.objectForPrimaryKey(
       "Task",
       new bson.ObjectID(task.id)
     );


* ``createTask``

  Whenever we modify an object in realm, we must do so within a 
  :ref:`transaction <node-open-a-transaction>`. 
  The :js-sdk:`write() <Realm.html#write>` method takes care of 
  transaction handling for us. So, within the ``write`` function, we call
  the :js-sdk:`create() <Realm.html#create>` function, passing in all of the 
  required properties:

  .. code-block:: js

     realm.write(() => {
        result = realm.create("Task", {
          _id: new bson.ObjectID(),
          _partition: "My Project",
          name: task.name,
          status: task.status,
        });
     });

  .. note::
    
    The ``write`` function replaces the need to call the 
    :js-sdk:`beginTransaction() <Realm.html#beginTransaction>`,  
    :js-sdk:`commitTransaction() <Realm.html#commitTransaction>`, and 
    :js-sdk:`cancelTransaction() <Realm.html#cancelTransaction>`
    methods.


* ``deleteTask``
    
  Deleting objects must also take place within a transaction. As with modifying 
  an object, we'll use the write() function to handle the transaction for us, 
  and then call the the :js-sdk:`delete() <Realm.html#delete>` function within 
  it:

  .. code-block:: js

     realm.write(() => {
       realm.delete(task);
       output.result("Task deleted.");
     });


* ``modifyTask``
    
  This function is called by both the ``editTask`` and ``changeStatus`` functions. 
  Like the ``createTask`` and ``deleteTask`` methods, when you change an object, 
  you do so within a transaction. Other than that, though, there is no specific 
  call to a Realm API to change an object. Rather, you change the *local* object 
  and Sync ensures the object is updated on the server.
  
  .. code-block:: js
    
      realm.write(() => {
        task = realm.objectForPrimaryKey("Task", new bson.ObjectID(answers.id));
        task[answers.key] = answers.value;
      });

  .. note::
    
     To learn more about Realm Sync, see :doc:`Sync Overview </sync/overview>`.


G. Run and Test
---------------

Once you have completed the code, you should run the app and check functionality. 

1. Open a terminal window and change to your app's directory.

#. Run the following commands to install all of the dependencies and start the 
   app:

   .. code-block:: sh
      
      npm install
      node index.js

#. Your terminal window will clear and you will see the initial menu prompting 
   you to log in or register as a new user:

   .. image:: /images/node-cli-start-screen.png
      :alt:  Initial menu
    
#. If you do not yet have a user account, enter an email and password, and the 
   system will create a new account and log you in. At this point, you should see 
   the main "menu" of choices. All of the options should now work for you except 
   the "watch" functionality, which we'll enable in the next section.

.. admonition:: Reminder
   
   If something isn't working for you, you can check out the ``main`` branch of 
   this repo to compare your code with our finished solution. 

H. Implement the Collection Listener
------------------------------------

A very handy feature in Realm is the ability to add a listener to a collection. 
The listener notifies your app when a change occurs in the collection. For our 
CLI, we want to listen for changes on the ``Tasks`` collection, and when one 
occurs, display a notification in the console window. To do this:

1. In your text editor, open the ``watch.js`` file. 

#. Our internal ``listener`` function is a callback function that takes two 
   parameters: the collection of tasks and a ``changes`` object that is sent 
   from Realm. The ``changes`` object has the following properties:

   * ``changes.deletions`` returns the index of the deleted item *before* 
     the deletion.

   * ``changes.insertions`` returns the index of the new object.

   * ``changes.modifications`` returns the index of the modified object.

#. In the ``watchForChanges`` function, you will get all of the objects in 
   the **Tasks** collection (just as we did in the ``getTasks`` function),  
   and then call the :js-sdk:`addListener() <Realm.Collection.html#addListener>` 
   method. Under the ``TODO`` comment, add the following code:

.. code-block:: js
   
   const tasks = realm.objects("Task");
   tasks.addListener(listener);

With this code update, you can now re-run the app and watch for changes. 

1. In the main menu, choose "Watch for changes". You will see that the UI 
   stays in a "waiting" state. 

2. Open a second terminal window and run the app again. In this second window, 
   try creating, modifying, and deleting tasks. Each time you perform an action, 
   the first terminal window will update with a notification. 

.. note::
   
   If you want to continue to work in the same process and have the change 
   notifications appear inline, you can modify the code 
   in ``main.js``, within the ``case Choices.WatchForChanges`` handler. The 
   inline code comment explains the change you can make.

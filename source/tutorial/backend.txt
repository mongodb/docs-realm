Overview
--------

In this tutorial, you will build a cloud application in order to track
issues created on GitHub repos using MongoDB Realm. This app will:

- Send an automatic response, with a greeting and helpful links, to all new issues created on your GitHub repo.
- Record all new issues created on your GitHub repo to a `{+atlas+} <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?tck=docs_realm>`_ cluster.  
- Send you a weekly summary of all the new issues created.

This tutorial should take around 30 minutes.

Outcome
-------

You will learn how to:

- Execute serverless application logic with :doc:`MongoDB Realm Functions </functions>`.
- Respond to database and scheduled :doc:`triggers </triggers>`.
- Save and use static data, such as API keys, using :doc:`values and secrets </values-and-secrets>`.
- Use the GitHub API within your MongoDB Realm app.
- View incoming requests and application events using :doc:`MongoDB Realm Application Logs </logs>`.


Prerequisites
-------------

- :doc:`Create a {+app+} </get-started/create-realm-app>`. If you have completed the task tracker tutorial, you can use the same backend {+app+}.
- (Recommended) Create a :github:`GitHub repository <new>`.

Procedure
---------

.. admonition:: Link a MongoDB Atlas Cluster
   :class: note
   
   This tutorial requires a :doc:`linked Atlas cluster
   </mongodb/link-a-data-source>` and a GitHub repository.

Summary
---------
- MongoDB Realm Functions allow you to execute server-side code for your application and can be called from other applications or other MongoDB Realm Functions.
- The MongoDB HTTP Service allows you to communicate with any other server through the HTTP protocol.
- MongoDB Realm Triggers allow you to execute server-side code in response to a database event or pre-defined schedule.

Overview
--------

In this tutorial, you will build a cloud application in order to track
issues created on GitHub repos using MongoDB Realm. This application
will: 

- Send an automatic response, with a greeting and helpful links, to all new issues created on your GitHub repo.
- Record all new issues created on your GitHub repo to a MongoDB Atlas cluster.  
- Send you a weekly summary of all the new issues created.

This tutorial should take around 30 minutes.

Outcome
-------

- You will learn how to execute serverless application logic with :doc:`MongoDB Realm Functions </functions>`.
- You will learn how to execute logic in response to database and scheduled :doc:`triggers </triggers>`.
- You will learn how to save and use static data, such as API keys, using :doc:`values and secrets</values-and-secrets>`.
- You will learn how to use the GitHub API within your MongoDB Realm app.
- You will learn how to view incoming requests and application events using :doc:`MongoDB Realm Application Logs</logs>`.


Prerequisites
-------------
- Know how to :doc:`create a Realm app</procedures/create-realm-app>`.
- Know how to create a GitHub repository.
- Know what GitHub issues are.

Procedure
---------

.. admonition:: Link a MongoDB Atlas Cluster
   :class: note
   
   This tutorial requires a :doc:`linked Atlas cluster
   </mongodb/link-a-cluster>` and a GitHub repository.

Summary
---------
- MongoDB Realm Functions allow you to execute server-side code for your application and can be called from other applications or other MongoDB Realm Functions.
- The MongoDB HTTP Service allows you to communicate with any other server through the HTTP protocol.
- MongoDB Realm Triggers allow you to execute server-side code in response to a database event or pre-defined schedule.

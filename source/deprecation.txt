As of September 2024, Atlas Device SDKs are deprecated. Atlas Device SDKs will
reach end-of-life and be removed on **September 30, 2025**. 

The Atlas Device SDKs are made up of two parts: the on-device database and
Atlas Device Sync. The on-device database will continue to exist as an open
source project.

Atlas Device Sync is deprecated. This means that apps built using Sync need to
move to an alternative solution or remove Sync before September 30, 2025. Refer
to the :ref:`App Services deprecation page <app-services-deprecation>` for more
information.

Device SDKs Community Branches
------------------------------

The Device SDKs will have community branches that remove Device Sync code from
their codebases. Learn more in the SDKs' README files:

- `Flutter <https://github.com/realm/realm-dart>`__
- `Kotlin <https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin>`__
- `.NET <https://github.com/realm/realm-dotnet>`__
- `JavaScript <https://github.com/realm/realm-js>`__
- `Swift <https://github.com/realm/realm-swift>`__

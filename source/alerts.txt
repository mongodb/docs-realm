Introduction
------------
{+atlas+} provides an Activity Feed for each 
:atlas:`project </organizations-projects/#std-label-projects>`
that displays events for the project. {+service-short+} activities are included 
in this feed, and you can access them through the {+atlas-short+} UI and the 
{+atlas-short+} API.

{+atlas-short+} Activity Feed
-----------------------------
The {+atlas-short+} Activity Feeds show events that have occurred at either the 
organization level or project level. Within the Project feed, you can find events 
related to your {+service-short+} applications. By using the filters, you can view 
and/or download only {+service-short+} events.

Access the Project Activity Feed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are two ways to access the Project Activity Feed: through the 
{+atlas-short+} UI, and via the Atlas API. The following {+atlas-short+} 
documentation pages describe each approach:

- :atlas:`View Activity Feed in the UI </tutorial/activity-feed/>`
- :atlas:`Get All Project Events via the API </reference/api/events-projects-get-all/>`

You can filter the Project Activity Feed results to show only {+service-short+} 
events, or a subset of {+service-short+} events. To do this, click the 
:guilabel:`Filter by event(s)` menu and check :guilabel:`Realm`. In the 
right-hand side of the menu, you will see 
all {+service-short+} events selected. De-select any that you do not want to see. 
The feed list automatically updates with each change you make.

Realm Alerts
------------
{+service-short+} alerts are a subset of 
:atlas:`{+atlas-short+} alerts </alerts/>`. The **Target** for 
all {+service-short+} alerts is "Realm"; within that target, there are several 
**types** for you to select:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Event Type
     - Condition
     - Description 

   * - :ref:`Sync <sync>`
     - Sync Failure
     - A Sync process has failed and cannot be restarted  
   
   * - :ref:`Sync <sync>`
     - Sync Failure
     - A Sync process has failed and cannot be restarted 
   
   * - :ref:`Trigger <triggers>` 
     - Trigger Failure
     - A Trigger has failed and cannot be restarted 
   
   * - :ref:`Deployment <static-hosting>` 
     - URL Confirmation (Static Hosting)
     - A Custom URL is confirmed for static hosting 
   
   * - :ref:`Deployment <application-deployment>` 
     - Successful Deploy
     - A user (or Code Deployment) deployment has succeeded 
   
   * - :ref:`Deployment <application-deployment>` 
     - Deployment Failure
     - A user (or Code Deployment) deployment has failed 
   
   * - :ref:`Limit <mongodb-service-limitations-request-traffic>`
     - Request Rate Limit
     - An overall request rate limit is hit
   
   * - :atlas:`Limit <reference/free-shared-limitations/>`
     - Free Tier Usage
     - Occurs twice when the free tier is at 75% and then 100% consumption

.. TODO: the free tier alert does not show up in the current cloud-dev!!

.. note:: Filtering By Application

   Filtering events by {+service-short+} application is not supported, but each event 
   (and its corresponding alert) provides context and routing information for the 
   appropriate application.

Default Alerts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. TODO: UI is not showing any default alerts, AFAICT


Set Up Custom {+service-short+} Alerts
--------------------------------------
For any activity that is not present in the default alerts, you can set a custom 
alert at the Project level.

You create {+service-short+} alerts in the same way you 
`create other {+atlas-short+} alerts <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/configure-alerts/>`_. 
When creating a new alert, in the :guilabel:`Alert if` section, 
select :guilabel:`Realm` from the :guilabel:`Target`.

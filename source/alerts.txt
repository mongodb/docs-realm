Introduction
------------
{+atlas+} provides an Activity Feed for each 
`project <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/organizations-projects/#std-label-projects>`_ 
that displays events that occurred for that project. {+service+} activities are 
included in this feed, and you can access them through the {+atlas+} UI and the 
{+atlas+} API.

{+atlas+} Activity Feed
-----------------------
The {+atlas+} Activity Feeds show events that have occurred at either the 
organization level or project level. Within the Project feed, you can find events 
related to your {+service+} applications. By using the filters, you can view 
and/or download only {+service+} events.

Access the Project Activity Feed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are two ways to access the Project Activity Feed: through the {+atlas+} UI, and 
via the Atlas API. The following {+atlas+} documentation pages describe each approach:

- `UI <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/tutorial/activity-feed/>`_
- `API <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/api/events-projects-get-all/>`_

You can filter the Project Activity Feed results to show only {+service+} events, 
or a subset of {+service+} events. To do this, click the 
:guilabel:`Filter by event(s)` menu and check :guilabel:`Realm`. In the 
right-hand side of the menu, you will see 
all {+service+} events selected. De-select any that you do not want to see. The 
feed list automatically updates with each change you make.

Realm Alerts
------------
{+service+} alerts are a subset of 
`{+atlas+} alerts <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/alerts/>`_. The **Target** for 
all {+service+} alerts is "Realm"; within that target, there are several **types** 
for you to select:

.. TODO: the free tier alert does not show up in the current cloud-dev!!

.. note:: Filtering By Application

   Filtering events by {+service+} application is not supported, but each event 
   (and its corresponding alert) provides context and routing information for the 
   appropriate application.

Default Alerts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. TODO: UI is not showing any default alerts, AFAICT


Set Up Custom {+service+} Alerts
--------------------------------
For any activity that is not present in the default alerts, you can set a custom 
alert at the Project level.

You create {+service+} alerts in the same way you 
`create other {+atlas+} alerts <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/configure-alerts/>`_. 
When creating a new alert, in the :guilabel:`Alert if` section, 
select :guilabel:`Realm` from the :guilabel:`Target`. 
The following table highlights the Types that are available to you:

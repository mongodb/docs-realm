Introduction
------------
{+atlas+} provides an Activity Feed that displays events for each 
:atlas:`project </organizations-projects/#std-label-projects>`. {+service-short+} 
activities are included in this feed. To view and/or download only 
{+service-short+} events, you can specify a filter, as described below.

Project Activity Feed
---------------------
There are two ways to access the Project Activity Feed: through the 
{+atlas-short+} UI, and through the Atlas API. The following {+atlas-short+} 
documentation pages describe each approach:

- :atlas:`View Activity Feed in the UI </tutorial/activity-feed/>`
- :atlas:`Get All Project Events through the API </reference/api/events-projects-get-all/>`

Filter Activities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+service-short+} activities are a subset of 
:atlas:`{+atlas-short+} alerts </alerts/>`. You can filter the Project Activity 
Feed results to show only {+service-short+} events, or a subset of 
{+service-short+} events. To do this, click the 
:guilabel:`Filter by event(s)` menu and check :guilabel:`Realm`. In the 
right-hand side of the menu, you will see 
all {+service-short+} events selected. Deselect any that you do not want to see. 
The feed list automatically updates with each change you make.

.. note:: Filtering By {+service-short+} Application

   The Activity Feed does not support filtering events by {+service-short+} 
   application, but each event (and its corresponding alert) provides context 
   and routing information for the appropriate application.

The **Category** for 
all {+service-short+} activities is "Realm"; within that category, there are 
several **Events**:

   * - Event Type

   * - :ref:`Sync <sync>`
     - Sync Failure

   * - :ref:`Trigger <trigger-types>` 
     - Trigger Failure
     - A Trigger has failed and cannot be restarted 
   
   * - :ref:`Deployment <static-hosting>` 
     - | URL Confirmation 
         for Static Hosting
     - A Custom URL is confirmed for static hosting 
   
   * - :ref:`Deployment <application-deployment>` 
     - Successful Deploy
     - A user (or Code Deployment) deployment has succeeded 
   
   * - :ref:`Deployment <application-deployment>` 
     - Deployment Failure
     - A user (or Code Deployment) deployment has failed 
   
   * - :ref:`Limit <mongodb-service-limitations-request-traffic>`
     - Request Rate Limit
     - An overall request rate limit was hit


{+service-short+} Alerts
------------------------
There are default alerts that map to three of the activities listed above. In 
addition, you can create custom alerts for the other {+service-short+} 
activities.

Default Alerts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default {+service-short+} alerts trigger a notification and email to the 
Project Owners. The three default {+service-short+} alerts occur when:

- A {+sync-short+} process fails and cannot be restarted  

- A trigger fails and cannot be restarted

- A {+service-short+} application hits an overall request rate limit

Custom {+service-short+} Alerts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For any activity that is not mapped to a default alert, you can set a custom 
alert at the Project level.

You create {+service-short+} alerts in the same way you :atlas:`create other 
{+atlas-short+} alerts </configure-alerts/>`. When creating a new alert, in the 
":guilabel:`Alert if`" section, select :guilabel:`Realm` from the 
:guilabel:`Target`.

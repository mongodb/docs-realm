In this tutorial, you will build a collaborative task tracker app with
{+service+}. With the app client, users can:

- Register themselves with email and password.
- Sign in to their account with their email and password and sign out later.
- View a list of projects they are a member of.
- View, create, modify, and delete tasks in projects.
- View a list of team members in their project.
- Add and remove team members to their project.

To get started, first:

- :doc:`Set up the backend for the tutorial </tutorial/realm-app>`

Next, complete any of the following clients to work with your new backend:

- :doc:`iOS with Swift </tutorial/ios-swift>`
- :doc:`Android with Kotlin </tutorial/android-kotlin>`
- :doc:`React Native (iOS and Android) with JavaScript </tutorial/react-native>`
- :doc:`The browser with GraphQL, JavaScript, and React </tutorial/web-graphql>`
- :doc:`A Node.js Command Line Interface (CLI) </tutorial/nodejs-cli>`

Additionally, you can create a headless backend app that uses webhooks,
functions, and triggers to integrate with GitHub and MongoDB:

- :doc:`Write a GitHub Issue Tracker with MongoDB Realm </tutorial/backend>`

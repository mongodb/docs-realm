Tutorials
---------

Realm Database tutorials provide a walkthrough of the code required to
implement Realm in mobile and backend applications. In these tutorials,
you clone git repositories, and follow along with a tutorial that walks
you through implementing Realm in your choice of:

- Mobile application clients
- Web browser
- Node.js CLI

If you prefer to learn by exploring and modifying a working application, 
without walking through the code to implement Realm, check out the 
:ref:`Realm template applications <template-applications>`.

.. _task-tracker-tutorial:

Task Tracker
~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this tutorial, you will build a collaborative task tracker app with
Realm. 

For more details, check out 

- :doc:`What you will build <tutorial/preview>`


To get started, first:

- :doc:`Set up the backend for the tutorial </tutorial/backend-app>`

Next, complete any of the following clients to work with your new backend:

- :doc:`iOS with Swift </tutorial/ios-swift>`
- :doc:`Android with Kotlin </tutorial/java-sdk>`
- :doc:`Xamarin (iOS and Android) with C# </tutorial/dotnet>`
- :doc:`React Native (iOS and Android) with JavaScript </tutorial/react-native>`
- :doc:`The browser with GraphQL, JavaScript, and React </tutorial/web-graphql>`
- :doc:`A Node.js Command Line Interface (CLI) </tutorial/nodejs-cli>`

.. _template-applications:

Template Applications
---------------------

Realm template applications are working example apps you can explore and 
modify as you learn about Realm. These apps are a good choice for developers
who prefer to experiment directly with working code instead of reading a 
guide that walks you through implementing the code.

Check out the :ref:`Realm template apps <template-apps>`.

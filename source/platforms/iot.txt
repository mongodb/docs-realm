Placeholder page for information about building for IoT.

Include info about which frameworks we support building for IoT, plus
any specific version or compatibility info worth calling out?

Install the SDK for IoT
-----------------------

.. TODO: Should also add details about C++ here

JavaScript Library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a Node.js project and add the Node.js SDK on an
Internet of Things (IoT) platform such as the Raspberry Pi 2, 3, or 4
running Raspberry Pi OS (formerly Raspbian), follow the steps below:

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Install a C++ Compiler

      The  Node.js SDK's IoT library is not distributed as a binary, so you 
      must build it from source. To do this, you'll need a working C++ compiler. 
      To install such a compiler on your IoT device, run the following command:

      .. code-block:: bash

         sudo apt install build-essential g++ libssl-dev

   .. step:: Create a Node.js Project

      Create your Node.js project by creating a new directory
      for your project and running ``npm init`` in that
      directory. In the example below, replace ``MyApp``
      with your desired project name. Answer all of the prompts
      to fill out the details of your project.

      .. code-block:: bash

         mkdir MyApp && cd MyApp && npm init

   .. step:: Install the SDK with NPM

      In your Node.js project directory, use the following command
      to add the SDK to your project:

      .. code-block:: bash

         npm install realm

   .. step:: Enable TypeScript (optional)

      TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static
      type checking and other features intended to make
      application-scale development more robust. If you'd like
      to use TypeScript, follow the TypeScript team's official
      `Node Starter guide
      <https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Node-Starter#typescript--node>`__.
      The SDK supports TypeScript natively and integrates easily
      into a TypeScript project.

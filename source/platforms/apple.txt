Placeholder page for information about building for Apple.

Include info about which frameworks we support building for Apple, plus
any specific version or compatibility info worth calling out?

Maybe make this a directory with Apple-specific content (Apple Privacy
Manifest, build for tvOS, etc.?)

Build for macOS
---------------

Device Sync and App Sandbox Entitlements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are developing for macOS and require network access, you must enable
network entitlements in your application. By default, Apple's App Sandbox
does not allow network requests due to built-in security settings.

Enable network entitlements to use these SDK features:

- :ref:`Device Sync <sdks-sync-data>`
- :ref:`Call an Atlas Function <sdks-call-function>`
- :ref:`Access MongoDB Atlas <sdks-access-mongodb>`

.. _sdks-macos-flutter-app-sandbox-entitlements:

With Flutter
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enable network requests in a Flutter application, add the following code
to **both** the files :file:`macos/Runner/DebugProfile.entitlements` and
:file:`macos/Runner/Release.entitlements`:

.. code-block:: xml
    :emphasize-lines: 2-3

    <!--  Other entitlements -->
    <key>com.apple.security.network.client</key>
    <true/>
    <!--  Other entitlements -->

For more information about Flutter development for macOS, refer to
`Building macOS apps with Flutter
<https://docs.flutter.dev/development/platform-integration/macos/building#setting-up-entitlements>`__
in the Flutter documentation.

Apple may require apps that use Atlas Device SDK to provide a privacy manifest
containing details about the SDK's data collection and use practices. The
bundled manifest file must be included when submitting new apps or app updates
to the App Store. For more details about Apple's requirements, refer to
:apple:`Upcoming third-party SDK requirements <support/third-party-SDK-requirements/>`
on the Apple Developer website.

Some of the SDK libraries provide a privacy manifest to comply with Apple's
required API disclosures and the reasons for using those APIs. You can view
the privacy manifests in each package, or in the relevant GitHub repository:

- Dart

  - ``realm-dart``/iOS:
    `https://github.com/realm/realm-dart/blob/main/packages/realm/ios/Resources/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy
    <https://github.com/realm/realm-dart/blob/main/packages/realm/ios/Resources/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy>`__
  - ``realm-dart``/macOS:
    `https://github.com/realm/realm-dart/blob/main/packages/realm/macos/Resources/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy
    <https://github.com/realm/realm-dart/blob/main/packages/realm/macos/Resources/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy>`__

- Swift: ``RealmSwift``: `https://github.com/realm/realm-swift/blob/master/RealmSwift/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy <https://github.com/realm/realm-swift/blob/master/RealmSwift/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy>`_
- ObjectiveC: ``Realm``: `https://github.com/realm/realm-swift/blob/master/Realm/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy <https://github.com/realm/realm-swift/blob/master/Realm/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy>`_

The SDK does not include analytics code in builds for the App Store.
The SDK does not log into Atlas on its own behalf.

If you write an app that uses any App Services functionality, such as
:ref:`connecting to Atlas <sdks-connect-to-atlas>` to:

- :ref:`Call an Atlas Function <sdks-call-function>`
- :ref:`Authenticate and manage users <sdks-manage-users>`
- :ref:`Access MongoDB Atlas <sdks-access-mongodb>`
- :ref:`Open a synced database <sdks-configure-and-open-synced-database>`

You may need to add additional disclosures to your app's privacy manifest
detailing your data collection and use practices when using these APIs.

For more information, refer to Apple's
:apple:`Privacy manifest files documentation <documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files>`.

Special Build Instructions
--------------------------

To include these manifests in a build target that uses ``RealmSwift``, you must
build ``RealmSwift`` as a dynamic framework. For details, refer to the Swift
Package Manager Installation instructions step
**(Optional) Build RealmSwift as a Dynamic Framework**.

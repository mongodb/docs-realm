Overview
--------

The **custom function** authentication provider allows you to define a
custom authentication flow using a :ref:`serverless function
<functions>`. You can use this provider to implement your own user
authentication logic or integrate an external authentication system.

When to Use Custom Function Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Custom function authentication is the most flexible form of
authentication. However, it also requires you to manually define and
configure the authentication flow yourself.

Before you define a custom function provider, consider if you can one
use of the :ref:`built-in authentication providers
<authentication-providers>` instead.

Consider using the custom function provider in your app if:

- You want to use an external authentication service that does not have
  a built-in provider. If the service uses JSON web tokens, consider
  creating a :ref:`Custom JWT <custom-jwt-authentication>` provider
  instead.

- You want to customize the authentication process beyond what's
  available in a built-in provider. For example, you could use a service
  to send customized confirmation emails instead of the default
  email/password provider emails.

.. important::
   
   {+service-short+} does not perform any data validation or
   authentication checks for the custom function provider.
   
   Make sure that you validate incoming data and that your
   authentication system performs appropriate authentication checks,
   such as requiring a password, :wikipedia:`two-factor authentication <Multi-factor_authentication>`, or a
   :wikipedia:`single sign-on <Single_sign-on>` token.

.. _authentication-function:

The Authentication Function
---------------------------

The authentication function is a JavaScript function that holds your
custom user authentication code. It runs whenever a user logs in through
the custom function provider. 

The function maps data provided at login, like a username and password
or an access token, to a string that uniquely identifies the user in
your external authentication system. For example, you could use the
provided data to log in to an external service over HTTP or using a
package from npm.

.. literalinclude:: /authentication/custom-function/the-authentication-function.js
   :language: javascript

Receive a Custom Credential Payload
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``payload`` object passed to the function contains data that was
included with the custom function provider credential in the client app.
The function accepts any value provided from your client app, so the
actual field names and values depend on your implementation.

.. example::

   The following code examples show how to create a function credential
   using the Realm SDKs. The credential includes a ``payload`` object
   that is passed to the authentication function.

   .. tabs-realm-languages::
   
      .. tab::
         :tabid: javascript
   
         .. code-block:: javascript
         
            const credentials = Realm.Credentials.function({
              username: "mongolover",
              pin: "24601",
            });
   
      .. tab::
         :tabid: java
   
         .. code-block:: java
            
            import org.bson.Document;
            import static java.util.Map.entry;
   
            val credentials: Credentials = Credentials.customFunction(
              Document(
                Map.ofEntries(
                  entry("username", "mongolover"),
                  entry("pin", "24601")
                )
              )
            )
   
      .. tab::
         :tabid: c-sharp
   
         .. code-block:: csharp
         
            var credentials = Credentials.Function(new {
              username = "mongolover",
              pin = "24601"
            })
   
      .. tab::
         :tabid: swift
   
         .. code-block:: swift
         
            let credentials = Credentials.function(payload: [
               "username": "mongolover",
               "pin": "24601"
            ])

Return an Authenticated User ID
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If authentication is successful, the function should return a unique
string identifier for the user. For example, you could return the user
ID value used by your external authentication system. This is the user's
*external ID*, which the provider uses to map from your custom system to
your app's internal user accounts.

.. important::
   
   The user's external ID is *not* the same as the user's internal
   account ID, which is exposed as the ``id`` field of a user object.
   You access the user's internal ID with ``%%user.id`` in expressions,
   ``context.user.id`` in functions, and the ``User.id`` property in the
   SDKs.

If an existing user is already associated with the external ID, the
provider logs that user in.

If the provider has no record of a given external ID, it creates a new
:ref:`user account <user-accounts>`, adds a custom function provider
identity, and then logs in the new user.

The identity object for the custom function provider is stored in the
:ref:`user object <user-objects>` and resembles the following:

.. code-block:: json
   :emphasize-lines: 4-7
   
   {
     "id": "<Internal User Account ID>",
     "identities": [
        {
          "providerType": "custom-function",
          "id": "<External User ID>",
        }
     ]
   }

.. example:: 
  
    The authentication function should return a unique external ID as a
    string:
    
    .. code-block:: javascript
    
      return "5f650356a8631da45dd4784c"
    
    You can also return an object that contains the external ID as its
    ``id`` value:
    
    .. code-block:: javascript

      return { "id": "5f650356a8631da45dd4784c" }

    If you want to define a display name for the user, define it in the
    ``name`` field of the returned object:
    
    .. code-block:: javascript
       :emphasize-lines: 3

       return {
         "id": "5f650356a8631da45dd4784c",
         "name": "James Bond"
       }

Throw an Error for Failed Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the user provided invalid credentials or the function otherwise fails
to authenticate the user, throw an error with a descriptive message.
This returns a ``401 - Unauthorized`` error with the message attached to
the SDK.

   :language: javascript

Set Up the Custom Function Provider
-----------------------------------

You can configure custom function authentication using any supported
deployment method.

   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui

      .. include:: /includes/steps/configure-custom-function-auth-realm-ui.rst 

   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli

      .. include:: /includes/steps/configure-custom-function-auth-import-export.rst

Configure Custom User Data
--------------------------

You can associate :ref:`custom data <custom-user-data>` in a MongoDB
Atlas collection with user accounts in your app. This can be helpful if
you often need to access a user's data but is not required to use the
custom function provider.

A user's custom data document may contain any data. For apps that use
the custom function provider, we recommend storing both the user's
internal user account ID and their external ID.

For example, you might use the following format:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "_id": "<Generated ObjectId>",
     "user_id": "<Internal User ID>",
     "external_id": "<External User ID>"
   }

You can use the following approach to create custom user documents for
custom function provider users:

1. Configure custom user data for a collection in your linked cluster.
   The User ID field stores the user's internal account ID.

   .. code-block:: json
      :caption: /auth/custom_user_data.json
      :emphasize-lines: 5
      
      {
        "mongo_service_name": "mongodb-atlas",
        "database_name": "myApp",
        "collection_name": "users",
        "user_id_field": "user_id",
        "enabled": true
      }

2. Configure the custom function authentication provider and return a
   unique external user ID from the authentication function. Realm
   stores this ID in the ``id`` field of the user's ``custom-function``
   identity.

   .. literalinclude:: /authentication/custom-function/handleCustomFunctionAuth.js
      :language: javascript

3. Set up an authentication trigger that listens for ``CREATE`` events
   from the ``custom-function`` provider. In the trigger function, add a
   new document to the custom user data collection that includes both
   the user's internal ID and external ID.

   .. literalinclude:: /authentication/custom-function/onNewCustomFunctionUser.js
      :language: javascript

Log In from a Realm SDK
-----------------------

To log in from a client application, use a Custom Function credential
that contains your login payload data.

For examples, refer to the documentation for a specific SDK:

- :ref:`Swift SDK <ios-login-custom-function>`
- :ref:`Java SDK <java-login-custom-function>`
- :ref:`.NET SDK <dotnet-login-custom-function>`
- :ref:`React Native SDK <react-native-login-custom-function>`
- :ref:`Node.js SDK <node-login-custom-function>`
- :ref:`Web SDK <web-login-custom-function>`

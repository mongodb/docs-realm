Overview
--------

{+backend+} represents each application user internally with a
**User Object** that includes a unique ID and additional
metadata that describes the user. You can access user
objects in the following ways:

- In a :doc:`Function </functions>` by accessing :ref:`context.user
  <context-user>`.

- In a :ref:`rule expression <expressions>` with the :json-expansion:`%%user`
  expansion.

- In :ref:`Android <java-authenticate>`, :ref:`iOS
  <ios-authenticate-users>`, :ref:`Node <node-authenticate-users>`,
  :ref:`React Native <react-native-authenticate-users>`, and 
  :ref:`.NET <dotnet-authenticate>` client applications.

Schema
------

User objects have the following form:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "id": "<Unique User ID>",
     "type": "<User Type>",
     "data": {
       "<Metadata Field>": <Value>,
       ...
     },
     "custom_data": {
       "<Custom Data Field>": <Value>,
       ...
     },
     "identities": [
       {
         "id": <Unique Identity ID>,
         "provider_type": "<Authentication Provider>",
         "data": {
           "<Metadata Field>": <Value>,
           ...
         }
       }
     ]
   }

.. note::

   In general, {+service+} creates a user object for a given user
   the first time that they authenticate. If you create a
   test :doc:`Email/Password </users/create>`
   user through the {+ui+}, {+service-short+} creates that user's user
   object immediately.

Summary
-------

- The user object contains relevant information about the user that you can use in your app logic.
- The exact information contained in the user object depends on the :doc:`authentication providers </authentication/providers>` used.

=====================
Linking User Accounts
=====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

MongoDB Realm provides multiple ways for you to integrate user
authentication into your apps. For this reason, you may want to provide
a way for your users to link their account from one provider with
another.

For example, suppose you have an app that enables users to authenticate
using Google or Facebook, but also allows anonymous log in. New users
of your app may explore the app's functionality as an anonymous user.
After working with the app for a while, a user decides to create an
account. The user logs in using their Google credentials, and your app
can link the data from their anonymous session to their account by using
Realm's user-linking feature.

To provide user account linking in your code, add your app's hosted
domain to the list of :guilabel:`Allowed Request Origins` in
:guilabel:`General Settings` and then use the
:guilabel:`linkWithCredential` method of the :guilabel:`StitchUser`
class. Documentation for this method can be found in the SDKs:

- :android-sdk:`Android SDK <com/mongodb/stitch/android/core/auth/StitchUser.html#linkWithCredential-com.mongodb.stitch.core.auth.StitchCredential->`

- :ios-sdk:`iOS SDK <Protocols/StitchUser.html#/s:10StitchCore0A4UserP4linky0aB3SDK0A10Credential_p04withF0_yAA0A6ResultOyAaB_pGctF>`

- :js-sdk:`JavaScript SDK <interfaces/stitchuser.html#linkwithcredential>`

Overview
--------

{+service+} provides multiple ways for you to integrate user
authentication into your apps. When a user logs in with a specific
provider, {+service+} associates an ``identity`` object that contains
the provider type of the user. Since there are multiple
:doc:`Authentication Providers </authentication/providers>`, you may
want to link an additional, new identity to an existing user account.

Consider an example application that allows users to explore anonymously
without first signing up for an account. After using the app for a
while, a user decides to create a new account by providing their email
and password. The user wants to associate their anonymous browsing history with their
new account. Luckily, the app developer made this possible by allowing
linking of the anonymous identity with the user account. This is done
by calling {+service-short+}'s ``linkWithCredential()`` method on the
``RealmUser`` instance.

      To provide user account linking in your code, add your app's
      hosted domain to the list of :guilabel:`Allowed Request Origins`
      in :guilabel:`General Settings` and then use the
      :js-sdk:`linkWithCredential() <interfaces/stitchuser.html#linkwithcredential>` method of the
      :guilabel:`RealmUser` class.

      To provide user account linking in your code, add your app's
      hosted domain to the list of :guilabel:`Allowed Request Origins`
      in :guilabel:`General Settings` and then use the
      :java-sdk:`linkCredentials()
      <io/realm/mongodb/User.html#linkCredentials-io.realm.mongodb.Credentials->`
      or :java-sdk:`linkCredentialsAsync()
      <io/realm/mongodb/User.html#linkCredentialsAsync-io.realm.mongodb.Credentials-io.realm.mongodb.App.Callback->`
      methods of the :guilabel:`User` class.

      To provide user account linking in your code, add your app's
      hosted domain to the list of :guilabel:`Allowed Request Origins`
      in :guilabel:`General Settings` and then use the :objc-sdk:`linkWithCredential() <Protocols/StitchUser.html#/s:10StitchCore0A4UserP4linky0aB3SDK0A10Credential_p04withF0_yAA0A6ResultOyAaB_pGctF>`
      method of the :guilabel:`RealmUser` class.

.. warning::

   Accounts created with the Email/Password authentication provider must
   in the "Pending User Login" user status. This means that the user has
   received and clicked their confirmation email, but has not yet
   attempted to login after confirming their account.

Usage
-----

The following usage example simulates an anonymous user login with the
``loginWithCredential()`` method. This method returns the anonymous
user. The anonymous user is then linked to an existing user created with
the username/password authentication provider by calling
``linkWithCredential()``.

Summary
-------
- {+service+} applications can have multiple authentication providers,
  and multiple identities from various authentication providers can be
  linked to one {+service-short+} user.

- Identities are linked to a user using the ``linkWithCredential()``
  method on a ``RealmUser`` instance.

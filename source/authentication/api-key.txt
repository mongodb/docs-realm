.. _api-key-authentication-overview:

Overview
--------

The API Key :ref:`authentication provider <authentication-providers>`
allows users to log in using generated keys. There are two types of API
keys in {+service+}: server keys and user keys.

.. _api-key-authentication-server-api-key:

Server API Keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Server API keys are generated in the {+ui+}. Creating a server API key
associates that API key with an automatically created {+service-short+} server user.
Provide a server key to external applications and services to allow them
to authenticate directly with {+service-short+}.

.. _api-key-authentication-user-api-key:

User API Keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

User API keys are generated for specific application users by the client
SDKs. You can allow devices or services to communicate with {+service-short+} on
behalf of a user by associating a unique user API key with each device.

User keys are always associated with a non-anonymous user. Each user can
associate up to 20 user keys with their account.

.. _api-key-authentication-configuration:

Configuration
-------------

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::

   tabs:
     - id: ui
       content: |
         You can enable and configure the API Key authentication
         provider from the {+ui+} by selecting :guilabel:`API Keys`
         from the :guilabel:`Authentication` page.

     - id: cli
       content: |
         You can enable and configure the API Key authentication
         provider with :doc:`realm-cli
         </deploy/realm-cli-reference>` by importing an
         application directory that contains a :ref:`configuration file
         <appschema-authentication-providers>` for the provider.

         The configuration file must be named ``api-key.json``
         and stored in the ``/auth_providers`` directory. Configuration
         files for the API Key authentication provider have the
         following form:

         .. code-block:: none
            :caption: /auth_providers/api-key.json

            {
              "name": "api-key",
              "type": "api-key",
              "disabled": false
            }

.. note::

   The API Key authentication provider does not have any
   provider-specific configuration options.

.. _api-key-authentication-usage-create-server-key:

Create a Server API Key
-----------------------

To create a new server API key, navigate to the API Key authentication
configuration page in the {+ui+} and click :guilabel:`Create API
Key`. Enter a unique name for the key and click :guilabel:`Save`.

.. important::

   Remember to copy the server key's value as soon as you create it.
   Once you leave the provider configuration page or disable the key you
   cannot retrieve the value from the {+ui+}.

.. _api-key-authentication-examples:

.. _api-key-authentication-summary:

Summary
-------

- The {+service-short+} API Key authentication provider allows users and services
  to connect to a {+app+} using API keys that look like a
  string of characters.
- User API Keys allow a user to interact with services via the {+service-short+}
  SDK. They are automatically generated in the client SDK.
- Server API Keys allow external services to interact with your {+app+}.
  These keys can only be generated via the {+ui+}.

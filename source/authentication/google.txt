Overview
--------

The Google authentication provider allows users to log in with their
existing Google account through `Google Sign-In
<https://developers.google.com/identity/>`_. When a user logs in, Google
provides {+service+} with an `OAuth 2.0 access token
<https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/>`_ for the user.
{+service-short+} uses the token to identify the user and access approved data from
Google APIs on their behalf.

Configuration
-------------

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: ui
      
      You can enable and configure the Google authentication provider
      from the {+ui+} by selecting :guilabel:`Google` from the
      :guilabel:`Users > Providers` page.
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: cli
      
      You can enable and configure the Google authentication provider
      with :doc:`realm-cli </deploy/realm-cli-reference>` by importing
      an application directory that contains a :ref:`configuration file
      <appschema-authentication-providers>` for the provider.
      
      The configuration file must be named ``oauth2-google.json`` and
      stored in the ``/auth_providers`` directory. Configuration files
      for the Google authentication provider have the following form:
      
      .. cssclass:: wide-container
      .. code-block:: none
         :caption: ``/auth_providers/oauth2-google.json``
      
         {
           "name": "oauth2-google",
           "type": "oauth2-google",
           "disabled": <boolean>,
           "config": {
             "clientId": <string>
           },
           "secret_config": {
             "clientSecret": <string>
           },
           "metadata_fields": [<document>, ...],
           "redirect_uris": [<string>, ...],
           "domain_restrictions": [<string>, ...]
         }

The Google authentication provider has the following configuration
options:

.. cssclass:: auth-table
.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 30

   * - Field
     - Description

   * - | :guilabel:`Client ID`
       | *config.clientId*
       
     - Required. An :guilabel:`OAuth 2.0 Client ID` for your project
       in the Google API Console.
       
       See :ref:`auth-gcp-project-setup` for information about setting
       up OAuth Credentials for your GCP project.
       
   * - | :guilabel:`Client Secret` 
       | *secret_config.clientSecret*
       
     - Required. The name of a :ref:`Secret <app-secret>` that stores
       an :guilabel:`OAuth 2.0 Client Secret` for your project from the
       Google API Console.
       
       See :ref:`auth-gcp-project-setup` for information about setting
       up OAuth Credentials for your GCP project.
       
   * - | :guilabel:`Metadata Fields`
       | *metadata_fields*

     - Optional. A list of fields describing the authenticated user that
       your application will request from the :google:`Google Identity API
       <identity/sign-in/web/reference#googleusergetbasicprofile>`.

       All metadata fields are omitted by default and can be required on
       a field-by-field basis. Users must explicitly grant your app
       permission to access each required field.
       If a metadata field is required and exists for a particular user,
       it will be included in their user object.
       
       To require a metadata field from an import/export
       configuration file, add an entry for the field to the
       ``metadata_fields`` array. Each entry should be a document of
       the following form:
       
       .. code-block:: javascript
       
          { name: "<metadata field name>", required: "<boolean>" }

   * - | :guilabel:`Redirect URIs`
       | *redirect_uris*

     - Required for web applications.
       A list of allowed redirect :abbr:`URIs (Uniform Resource
       Identifiers)`.

       Once a user completes the authentication process on Google, {+service-short+}
       redirects them back to either a specified redirect URI or, if no
       redirect URI is specified, the URL that they initiated the
       authentication request from. {+service-short+} will only redirect a user to a
       URI that exactly matches an entry in this list, including the
       protocol and any trailing slashes.

   * - | :guilabel:`Domain Restrictions`
       | *domain_restrictions*

     - Optional. A list of approved :wikipedia:`domains <Domain_name>`
       for user accounts.

       If specified, the provider checks the domain of a user's primary
       email address on Google and only allows them to authenticate if
       the domain matches an entry in this list.

       For example, if ``example1.com`` and ``example2.com`` are listed,
       a Google user with a primary email of ``joe.mango@example1.com``
       would be allowed to log in, while a user with a primary email of
       ``joe.mango@example3.com`` would not be allowed to log in.

       .. note::

          If you've specified any domain restrictions, you must also
          require the email address field in the :guilabel:`Metadata
          Fields` setting.

Set Up a Project in the Google API Console

The Google authentication provider requires a :gcp:`project in the Google
API Console </>` to manage authentication and user permissions. The
following steps walk through creating the project, generating OAuth
credentials, and configuring the provider to connect with the project.

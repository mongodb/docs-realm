Overview
--------

The Apple ID authentication provider allows users to log in with their
Apple ID credentials through `Sign in with Apple
<https://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple/>`_. This authentication
method uses the industry-standard `OAuth 2.0 <https://oauth.net/2/>`_
authorization protocol.

When a user successfully logs in through Sign in with Apple, Apple
returns a credential object that includes a :jwt-io:`JSON Web Token
<introduction>` that the Apple ID provider uses to authenticate the
user. If the user has granted permissions to your app, the credential
object may also include the user's name and email address.

For additional information on how to implement Sign in with Apple, check
out the `Introducing Sign In with Apple
<https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/706>`_ session from
WWDC 2019 and the associated `reference application
<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/adding_the_sign_in_with_apple_flow_to_your_app>`_.

.. note::
   
   An iOS app that uses Apple ID authentication must target iOS 13 or newer.

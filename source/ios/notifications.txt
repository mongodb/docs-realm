Overview
--------

Any modern app should be able to react when data changes, regardless of
where that change originated. When a user adds a new item to a list, you
may want to update the UI, show a notification, or log a message. When
someone updates that item, you may want to change its visual state or
fire off a network request. When someone deletes the item, you probably
want to remove it from the UI. Realm's notification system allows you to
watch for and react to changes in your data, independent of the writes
that caused the changes.

Realm emits three kinds of notifications:

- :ref:`Realm notifications <ios-realm-notifications>` whenever a specific Realm commits a write transaction.
- :ref:`Collection notifications <ios-collection-notifications>` whenever any :term:`Realm object` in a collection changes, including inserts, updates, and deletes.
- :ref:`Object notifications <ios-object-notifications>` whenever a specific Realm object changes, including updates and deletes.

.. _ios-subscribe-to-changes:

Subscribe to Changes
--------------------

To observe a Realm, collection, or object:

1. Create a notification handler for the Realm, collection, or object notification.
2. Add the notification handler to the Realm, collection, or object that you want to observe.
3. Receive a notification token from the call to add the handler. Retain this token as long as you want to observe.
4. When you are done observing, invalidate the token.

.. _ios-realm-notifications:

Realm Notifications
-------------------

You can register a notification handler on an entire :ref:`{+realm+}
<ios-realms>`. {+client-database+} calls the notification handler
whenever any write transaction involving that Realm is committed. The
handler receives no information about the change.

This is useful when you want to know that there has been a
change but do not care to know specifically what changed.
For example, proof of concept apps often use this
notification type and simply refresh the entire UI when
anything changes. As the app becomes more sophisticated and
performance-sensitive, the app developers shift to more
granular notifications.

.. example::

  Suppose you are writing a real-time collaborative app. To
  give the sense that your app is buzzing with collaborative
  activity, you want to have an indicator that lights up when
  any change is made. In that case, a realm notification
  handler would be a great way to drive the code that controls
  the indicator.

.. _ios-collection-notifications:

Collection Notifications
------------------------

You can register a notification handler on a :ref:`collection
<ios-client-collections>` within a {+realm+}. The handler receives a
description of changes since the last notification. Specifically, this
description consists of three lists of indices:

- The indices of the objects that were deleted.
- The indices of the objects that were inserted.
- The indices of the objects that were modified.

.. important:: Order Matters
   
   In collection notification handlers, always apply changes
   in the following order: deletions, insertions, then
   modifications. Handling insertions before deletions may
   result in unexpected behavior.

Realm Database emits an initial notification after retrieving the
collection. After that, Realm Database delivers collection
notifications asynchronously whenever a write transaction
adds, changes, or removes objects in the collection.

Unlike Realm notifications, collection notifications contain
detailed information about the change. This enables
sophisticated and selective reactions to changes. Collection
notifications provide all the information needed to manage a
list or other view that represents the collection in the UI.

.. example::

  The following code shows how to observe a collection for
  changes in order to update the UI.

.. _ios-object-notifications:

Object Notifications
--------------------

You can register a notification handler on a specific object
within a Realm. Realm Database notifies your handler:

- When the object is deleted.
- When any of the object's properties change.

The handler receives information about what fields changed
and whether the object was deleted.

.. example::

  The following code shows how to open a default realm, create
  a new instance of a class, and observe that instance for
  changes.

Summary
-------

- Notifications allow you to watch for and react to changes on your objects, collections, and {+realms+}.
- When you add a notification handler to an object, collection, or Realm that you wish to observe, you receive a token. Retain this token as long as you wish to keep observing.
- {+client-database+} has three notification types: {+realm+}, collection, and object notifications. Realm notifications only tell you that something changed, while collection and object notifications allow for more granular observation.

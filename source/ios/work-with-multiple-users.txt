Overview
--------

Multiple :ref:`users <user-accounts>` can log in to a :term:`{+service-short+}
client` simultaneously. You can quickly switch between authenticated users
without requiring them to log in again.

.. important::

   {+service-short+} clients run in the context of a single active user even if
   multiple users are logged in simultaneously. 

User Account States
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a user first logs in to a {+service-short+} client on a given device, the
SDK saves the user's information and keeps track of the user's state on the
device. The user's data remains on the device, even if they log out, unless you
actively :ref:`remove the user <ios-remove-user>`.

The following states describe an on-device user at any given time:

- **Authenticated:** any user that has logged in on the client device
  and has not logged out or had its session revoked.
  
  - **Active**: a single authenticated user that is currently using the client
    app. The SDK associates this user with outgoing requests and
    {+backend-short+} evaluates data access permissions and runs functions in
    this user's context. See :ref:`active user <active-user>` for more
    information.
   
  - **Inactive**: all authenticated users that are not the current
    active user. You can :ref:`switch the active user <ios-switch-user>` to a
    currently inactive user at any time.

- **Logged Out:** any user that authenticated on the client device but
  has since logged out or had its session revoked.

The following diagram shows how users within a {+service-short+} client app
transition between states when certain events occur:

.. _ios-add-user:

Add a New User to a Device
--------------------------

The {+service-short+} SDK automatically adds users to a device when they log in
for the first time on that device. When a user logs in, they immediately become
the application's :ref:`active user <active-user>`.

.. _ios-list-users:

List All On-Device Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can access a list of all :ref:`user accounts <user-accounts>` that are
stored on the device. This list includes all users that have logged in to the
client app on a given device regardless of whether they are currently
authenticated.

.. _ios-switch-user:

Switch the Active User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can quickly switch an app's :ref:`active user <active-user>` to another
logged in user at any time.

.. _ios-remove-user:

Remove a User from the Device
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can remove all information about a user from the device and automatically
log the user out.

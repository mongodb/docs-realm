Overview
--------

This page contains information to quickly get {+client-database+}
integrated into your app. Before you begin, ensure you have:

- :ref:`Created a {+app+} <create-a-realm-app>`
- :ref:`Enabled {+sync+} <enable-sync>`
- :ref:`Installed the iOS SDK <ios-install>`

.. admonition:: Check Out the Tutorial
   :class: note
   
   This page contains only the essential information that you need to set up a
   MongoDB Realm application. If you prefer to follow a guided tutorial that
   shows you step-by-step how to set up a working app, check out the :ref:`iOS
   Tutorial <ios-swift-tutorial>` where you'll build a mobile app that connects
   to the :ref:`Task Tracker backend <tutorial-task-tracker-create-realm-app>`.

Import Realm
------------

Near the top of any Swift file that uses Realm, add the following import
statement:

.. code-block:: swift

   import RealmSwift

.. _ios-quick-start-init-app:

Initialize the App
------------------

To use {+backend+} features such as authentication and sync, you must
access your {+app+} using your {+app+} ID. You can find your {+app+} ID in the
{+ui+}.

.. code-block:: swift

   let app = RealmApp(id: "your-realm-app-id")

Define Your Object Model
------------------------

If have not :ref:`enabled {+sync+} <enable-sync>` or you enabled {+sync-short+} with
:term:`Development Mode` in the {+ui+}, you can define your :ref:`object model
<ios-realm-objects>` directly in code.

.. note::

   If you have enabled {+sync-short+} but turned off Developer Mode, you can copy and paste the object model definitions that {+backend-short+} generated for you from the :guilabel:`SDKs` tab in the {+ui+}. You must re-enable Developer Mode if you want to make changes to the object model definition from client side code. See :ref:`Configure Your Data Model <configure-your-data-model>`.

.. code-block:: swift

   class Task: Object {
       @objc dynamic var _id: ObjectId = ObjectId.generate()

       // When configuring Sync, we selected `_partition` as the partition key.
       // A partition key is only required if you are using Sync.
       @objc dynamic var _partition: String = ""

       @objc dynamic var name: String? = nil
       @objc dynamic var complete = false

       override static func primaryKey() -> String? {
           return "_id"
       }

       convenience init(partition: String, name: String) {
           self.init()
           self._partition = partition
           self.name = name
       }
   }

.. _ios-quick-start-authenticate:

Authenticate a User
-------------------

When you have enabled :ref:`anonymous authentication <anonymous-authentication>` in the
{+ui+}, users can immediately log into your app without providing any identifying
information:

.. code-block:: swift

   app.login(withCredential: AppCredentials.anonymous()) { (user, error) in
        // Remember to dispatch back to the main thread in completion handlers
        // if you want to do anything on the UI.
        DispatchQueue.main.sync {
          guard error == nil else {
            print("Login failed: \(error!)")
            return
          }

          // Now logged in, do something with user

        }
    }

{+service-short+} provides many additional ways to authenticate, register, and link users.

.. seealso:: :ref:`Authenticate a User <ios-authenticate>`

Open a Realm
------------

Once you have :ref:`enabled {+sync+} <enable-sync>` and authenticated a user, you can open
a synced :ref:`{+realm+} <ios-realms>`:

.. code-block:: swift

   let user = app.currentUser()
   let partitionValue = "myPartition"
   realm = try! Realm(configuration: user.configuration(partitionValue: partitionValue))

.. seealso:: :ref:`Sync Data <ios-sync-data>`


Create, Read, Update, and Delete Objects
----------------------------------------

Once you have opened a {+realm+}, you can modify it and its :ref:`objects <ios-realm-objects>` in a :ref:`write transaction <ios-realm-database-writes>` block.

To create a new Task, instantiate the Task class and add it to the {+realm+} in a write block:

.. code-block:: swift

   let task = Task(partition: partitionValue, name: "New Task")
   try! self.realm.write {
       self.realm.add(task)
   }

You can retrieve a live :ref:`collection <ios-client-collections>` of all tasks in the {+realm+}:

.. code-block:: swift

   // All tasks in the realm
   let tasks = realm.objects(Task.self)

You can also filter that collection using a :ref:`filter <ios-client-query-engine>`:

.. code-block:: swift

   // You can also filter a collection
   let tasksThatBeginWithA = tasks.filter("name beginsWith 'A'")
   let completeTasks = tasks.filter("complete = true")

To modify a task, simply update its properties in a write transaction block:

.. code-block:: swift

   let task = tasks[someIndex]
  
   // All modifications to a realm must happen in a write block.
   try! realm.write {
       task.complete = true
   }

Finally, you can delete a task:

.. code-block:: swift

   let task = tasks[someIndex]
  
   // All modifications to a realm must happen in a write block.
   try! realm.write {
       // Delete the Task.
       realm.delete(task)
   }

Watch for Changes
-----------------

You can :ref:`watch a realm, collection, or object for changes <ios-client-notifications>`
with the `observe` method.

.. note::

   Be sure to retain the notification token returned by ``observe`` as long as you want to continue observing. When you are done observing, invalidate the token to free the resources.

.. code-block:: swift

   // Retain notificationToken as long as you want to observe
   notificationToken = tasks.observe { (changes) in
        switch changes {
        case .initial:
            // Results are now populated and can be accessed without blocking the UI
        case .update(_, let deletions, let insertions, let modifications):
            // Query results have changed.
            print("Deleted indices: ", deletions)
            print("Inserted indices: ", insertions)
            print("Modified modifications: ", modifications)
        case .error(let error):
            // An error occurred while opening the Realm file on the background worker thread
            fatalError("\(error)")
        }
   }

   // Later, when done observing
   notificationToken.invalidate()


Log Out
-------

Once logged in, you can log out:

.. code-block:: swift

   app.logOut(completion: { (error) in
       // Logged out or error occurred
   })




Complete Example
----------------

Run the complete example, by replacing the appId with your realm app ID.

.. code-block:: swift

   import UIKit
   import RealmSwift

   let app = RealmApp(id: "<your-realm-app-id>") // replace this with your App ID

   class Task: Object {
      @objc dynamic var _id: ObjectId = ObjectId.generate()

      // When configuring Sync, we selected `_partition` as the partition key.
      // A partition key is only required if you are using Sync.
      @objc dynamic var _partition: String = ""

      @objc dynamic var name: String? = nil
      @objc dynamic var complete = false

      override static func primaryKey() -> String? {
         return "_id"
      }

      convenience init(partition: String, name: String) {
         self.init()
         self._partition = partition
         self.name = name
      }
   }

   class WelcomeViewController: UIViewController {

      override func viewDidLoad() {
         super.viewDidLoad();
         signIn()
      }
      
      @objc func signIn() {
            print("Attempting to login")
            app.login(withCredential: AppCredentials.anonymous()) { (user, error) in
               // Remember to dispatch back to the main thread in completion handlers
               // if you want to do anything on the UI.
               DispatchQueue.main.sync {
                  guard error == nil else {
                  print("Login failed: \(error!)")
                  return
                  }
               
                  print("Login succeeded!");
                  // Now logged in, do something with user
   
                  let user = app.currentUser()
                  let partitionValue = "myPartition"
                  let realm = try! Realm(configuration: user!.configuration(partitionValue: partitionValue))
               
                  // All tasks in the realm
                  let tasks = realm.objects(Task.self)
               
                  // Retain notificationToken as long as you want to observe
                  let notificationToken = tasks.observe { (changes) in
                        switch changes {
                        case .initial: break
                           // Results are now populated and can be accessed without blocking the UI
                        case .update(_, let deletions, let insertions, let modifications):
                           // Query results have changed.
                           print("Deleted indices: ", deletions)
                           print("Inserted indices: ", insertions)
                           print("Modified modifications: ", modifications)
                        case .error(let error):
                           // An error occurred while opening the Realm file on the background worker thread
                           fatalError("\(error)")
                        }
                  }
               
               
               
               
                  let task = Task(partition: partitionValue, name: "New Task")
                  try! realm.write {
                     realm.add(task)
                  }
                  let anotherTask = Task(partition: partitionValue, name: "Another new task")
                  try! realm.write {
                     realm.add(anotherTask)
                  }
               
               
                  // You can also filter a collection
                  let tasksThatBeginWithA = tasks.filter("name beginsWith 'A'")
                  print("A list of all tasks that being with A: \(tasksThatBeginWithA)")
               
               
                  let taskToUpdate = tasks[1]

                  // All modifications to a realm must happen in a write block.
                  try! realm.write {
                     taskToUpdate.complete = true
                  }
               
                  let completeTasks = tasks.filter("complete = true")
                  print("A list of all tasks that are complete: \(tasksThatBeginWithA)")
               
               
               
                  print("A list of all tasks: \(tasks)")

      } 
   }

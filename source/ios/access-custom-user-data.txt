Overview
--------

You can read arbitrary data about your application users, known as
custom user data, directly within your ios application. For example,
you might store a user's preferred language, date of birth, or local
timezone. To learn more about custom user data, see :ref:`Enable Custom
User Data <custom-user-data>`.

.. _ios-read-custom-user-data:

Read Custom User Data
---------------------

You can read the custom user data of a currently logged in user through
that user's ``User`` object. You cannot edit custom user data through a
``User`` object. To edit custom user data, see :ref:`Update Custom User
Data <ios-update-custom-user-data>`. To read the data, access the
``customData`` property on the ``User`` object of a logged in user:

.. warning:: Custom Data May Be Stale
   
   {+backend+} does not dynamically update the value of the client-side
   user custom data document immediately when underlying data changes.
   Instead, {+backend+} fetches the most recent version of custom user
   data whenever a user refreshes their :ref:`access token
   <user-sessions>`, which is used by most SDK operations that contact
   the {+backend+} back end. {+service-short+} refreshes access tokens
   every 30 minutes, so custom user data can be stale for no more than
   30 minutes.

.. note::

   If you require the most recent version of custom user data, use the
   :objc-sdk:`refreshCustomDataWithCompletion
   <Classes/RLMUser.html#/c:objc(cs)RLMUser(im)refreshCustomDataWithCompletion:>`
   method to request the latest version of a user's custom data.

Write Custom User Data
----------------------

To create, update, or delete custom user data, you will need the following
information from your app's custom user data configuration:

- the :term:`custom user data cluster`

- the :term:`custom user data database`

- the :term:`custom user data collection` in which custom
  user data documents are stored

- the :term:`user ID field` used to map custom user data documents
  to users (via :term:`user ID`)

.. tip::
   
   You can find this information in the {+ui+} on the :guilabel:`App Users` page
   under the :guilabel:`Custom User Data` tab.

.. _ios-create-custom-user-data:

Create Custom User Data for a User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create custom user data for a user, create a MongoDB document in the
custom user data collection. The user ID field of the document should
contain the the user's :term:`user ID`. The following example uses
:ref:`MongoDB Data Access <ios-mongodb-data-access>` to insert a
document containing the user ID of the currently logged in user and a
``favoriteColor`` value into the custom user data collection:

.. tabs-realm-languages::
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift
      
      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/CustomUserData.codeblock.create-custom-user-data.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/CustomUserData.codeblock.create-custom-user-data.m
         :language: objective-c


You can add any number of arbitrary fields and values to the custom user
data document when you create it. The user ID field is the only
requirement for the document to become available on the ``User`` object
as custom user data.

.. _ios-update-custom-user-data:

Update Custom User Data for a User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can update custom user data using :ref:`MongoDB Data Access
<ios-mongodb-data-access>`, {+service-short+} :ref:`Sync
<ios-sync-data>`, `MongoDB Compass
<https://docs.mongodb.com/compass>`__, or the :atlas:`MongoDB Atlas Data
Explorer </data-explorer/>`.

To update a user's custom user data with MongoDB Data Access, edit the
MongoDB document whose user ID field contains the user ID of the user.
The following example uses :ref:`MongoDB Data Access
<ios-mongodb-data-access>` to update the ``favoriteColor`` field of the
the document containing the user ID of the currently logged in user in
the custom user data collection:

.. tabs-realm-languages::
   
   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift
      
      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/CustomUserData.codeblock.update-custom-user-data.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/CustomUserData.codeblock.update-custom-user-data.m
         :language: objective-c
         :emphasize-lines: 12-13

.. tip::
   
   To determine a user's ID, access the ``User.id`` property or find the user in the {+ui+}
   on the :guilabel:`App Users` page under the :guilabel:`Users` tab.

Summary
-------

- You can use custom user data to store arbitrary information about your application users.

- {+service+} stores custom user data as a document in a MongoDB collection determined by your application configuration.

- {+service+} associates custom user data with a user based on the value of the user ID field.

- The custom user data field of the user object is read-only. You can modify custom user data using :ref:`MongoDB Data Access
  <ios-mongodb-data-access>` or :ref:`Sync <ios-sync-data>`.

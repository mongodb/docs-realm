Prerequisites
-------------

Before you can access a synced {+realm+} from the client, you must:

- :ref:`Enable sync <enable-sync>` in the {+ui+}.
- :ref:`Initialize the app <ios-init-appclient>` and :ref:`authenticate a user <ios-authenticate>` in your client project.

Open a Synced Realm
-------------------

To open a synced :term:`{+realm+}` for a given :term:`partition value`, initialize a
``Realm`` with a configuration object generated by passing the partition value to the
authenticated user's ``configuration`` method:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/OpenCloseRealm.codeblock.open-synced-realm-synchronously.swift
   :language: swift

If it is the first time opening that particular {+realm+}, especially if it is a read-only
realm, use the ``Realm.asyncOpen()`` method instead:

.. note:: Why Use asyncOpen?

   The ``Realm()`` initializer is convenient, but upon first open of a given {+realm+}, it
   writes the schema to disk. The {+service-short+} server interprets this initial local
   schema as a write. If the {+realm+} is read-only, then the operation fails, causing the
   client to error out. Therefore, it is always recommended to use the
   ``Realm.asyncOpen()`` method the first time you open any given read-only {+realm+}.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/OpenCloseRealm.codeblock.open-synced-realm.swift
   :language: swift

The :ref:`partition value <partitioning>` specifies which subset of your data to sync.
This is typically a user ID, project ID, store ID, or some other category identifier in
your app that has particular relevance to the current user.

   :ref:`Partition Atlas Data into Realms <partitioning>`

Sync Data
---------

The syntax to :ref:`read <ios-realm-database-reads>`, :ref:`write
<ios-realm-database-writes>`, and :ref:`watch for changes <ios-client-notifications>` on a
synced {+realm+} is identical to the syntax for non-synced {+realms+}. While you 
work with local data, a background thread efficiently integrates, uploads, and 
downloads changesets.

.. important:: When Using Sync, Avoid Writes on the Main Thread

   The fact that {+service-short+} performs sync integrations on a background thread means
   that if you write to your {+realm+} on the main thread, there's a small chance your UI
   could appear to hang as it waits for the background sync thread to finish a write
   transaction. Therefore, it's a best practice :ref:`never to write on the main thread
   when using {+sync+} <ios-threading-three-rules>`.

The following code reads a collection of ``Task`` objects, watches that collection for
changes, then writes a new ``Task`` to the {+realm+}:

.. code-block:: swift

   // Read all tasks in the realm. No special syntax required for synced realms.
   let tasks = realm.objects(Task.self)

   // Watch for changes. No special syntax required for synced realms.
   // Retain notificationToken as long as you want to observe.
   let notificationToken = tasks.observe { (changes) in
        print("Changed: \(changes)")
   }

   // Write to the realm. No special syntax required for synced realms.
   try! realm.write {
     realm.add(Task(partition: partitionValue, name: "My task"))
   }

   // Later, when done observing
   notificationToken.invalidate()

Background Data Sync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you want your app to update data in the background (while the app is minimized), 
iOS requires you to implement `Background App Refresh  
<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/app_and_environment/scenes/preparing_your_ui_to_run_in_the_background/updating_your_app_with_background_app_refresh>`_. 
Enabling Background App Refresh minimizes the time it takes for the user to see 
the most recent data; without Background App Refresh, {+realm+} updates the 
data when the user launches the app, potentially resulting in a noticeable lag.

Summary
-------

- Open a synced {+realm+} with the configuration object generated when you pass 
  a :term:`partition value` to the user object's ``configuration`` method.
- Compared to using a non-synced {+realm+}, there is no special syntax for 
  reading from, writing to, or watching objects on a synced {+realm+}.
- You should avoid writing to a synced {+realm+} on the main thread.

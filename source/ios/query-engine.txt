Overview
--------

To filter data in your {+realm+}, you can leverage
{+client-database+}'s query engine. {+client-database+}'s
query engine supports common predicates of `NSPredicate
<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nspredicate>`__.
For an introduction to NSPredicate in general, See Apple’s
`Predicates Programming Guide
<https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Predicates/AdditionalChapters/Introduction.html>`__.


Predicates
----------

You can build a filter with NSPredicate:

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/QueryEngine.codeblock.predicates.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/QueryEngine.codeblock.predicates.m
         :language: objective-c

Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~

Filters consist of **expressions** in an NSPredicate. An expression consists of
one of the following:

- The name of a property of the object currently being evaluated.
- An operator and up to two argument expression(s).
- A literal string, number, or date.

Dot Notation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

When referring to an object property, you can use **dot notation** to refer
to child properties of that object. You can even refer to the properties of
:ref:`embedded objects <ios-embedded-objects>` and :ref:`relationships
<ios-client-relationships>` with dot notation.

For example, consider a query on an object with a ``workplace`` property that
refers to a Workplace object. The Workplace object has an embedded object
property, ``address``. You can chain dot notations to refer to the zipcode
property of that address: 

.. code-block:: objective-c

   workplace.address.zipcode == 10012

Substitutions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the following substitutions in your predicate format strings:

- ``%@`` to specify values
- ``%K`` to specify `keypaths <https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/ReferenceManual/Expressions.html#grammar_key-path-expression>`_

.. tabs-realm-languages::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: swift

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/QueryEngine.codeblock.substitutions.swift
         :language: swift

   .. tab::
      :tabid: objective-c

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/QueryEngine.codeblock.substitutions.m
         :language: objective-c

Subqueries
~~~~~~~~~~

You can iterate through a collection property with another query using the
``SUBQUERY()`` predicate function. ``SUBQUERY()`` has the following signature:

.. code-block:: objective-c

   SUBQUERY(<collection>, <variableName>, <predicate>)

- ``collection``: the name of the list property to iterate through
- ``variableName``: a variable name of the current element to use in the subquery
- ``predicate``: a string that contains the subquery predicate. You can use the
  variable name specified by ``variableName`` to refer to the currently-iterated
  element.

.. example::

    Running the following filter on a projects collect returns projects with
    tasks that have not been completed by a user named Alex.

   .. tabs-realm-languages::

      .. tab::
         :tabid: swift

         .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/QueryEngine.codeblock.subquery.swift
             :language: swift

      .. tab::
         :tabid: objective-c

         .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/QueryEngine.codeblock.subquery.m
             :language: objective-c



Operators
---------

There are several types of operators available to filter a
:ref:`Realm collection <ios-client-collections>`. Filters
work by **evaluating** an operator expression for every
:term:`object <Realm object>` in the collection being
filtered. If the expression resolves to ``true``, Realm
Database includes the object in the results collection.

.. note:: About the examples on this page
   
   The examples in this page use a simple data set for a
   task list app. The two Realm object types are ``Project``
   and ``Task``. A ``Task`` has a name, assignee's name, and
   completed flag. There is also an arbitrary number for
   priority -- higher is more important -- and a count of
   minutes spent working on it. A ``Project`` has zero or more
   ``Tasks``.

   See the schema for these two classes, ``Project`` and
   ``Task``, below:

   .. tabs-realm-languages::

      .. tab::
         :tabid: swift

         .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/QueryEngine.codeblock.models.swift
             :language: swift

      .. tab::
         :tabid: objective-c

         .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/QueryEngine.codeblock.models.m
             :language: objective-c

   You can set up the {+realm+} for these examples with the following code:

   .. tabs-realm-languages::

      .. tab::
         :tabid: swift

         .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/QueryEngine.codeblock.setup.swift
            :language: swift

      .. tab::
         :tabid: objective-c

         .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/QueryEngine.codeblock.setup.m
             :language: objective-c

Comparison Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most straightforward operation in a search is to compare
values.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - ``between``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand numerical or date expression is between or equal to the right-hand range. For dates, this evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand date is within the right-hand date range.

   * - | ``==``, ``=``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand expression is equal to the right-hand expression.

   * - | ``>``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand numerical or date expression is greater than the right-hand numerical or date expression. For dates, this evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand date is later than the right-hand date.

   * - | ``>=``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand numerical or date expression is greater than or equal to the right-hand numerical or date expression. For dates, this evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand date is later than or the same as the right-hand date.

   * - ``in``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand expression is in the right-hand list or string.

   * - | ``<``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand numerical or date expression is less than the right-hand numerical or date expression. For dates, this evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand date is earlier than the right-hand date.

   * - | ``<=``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand numeric expression is less than or equal to the right-hand numeric expression. For dates, this evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand date is earlier than or the same as the right-hand date.

   * - | ``!=``, ``<>``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand expression is not equal to the right-hand expression.

.. example::

   The following example uses the query engine's
   comparison operators to:

   - Find high priority tasks by comparing the value of the ``priority`` property value with a threshold number, above which priority can be considered high.
   - Find just-started or short-running tasks by seeing if the ``progressMinutes`` property falls within a certain range.
   - Find unassigned tasks by finding tasks where the ``assignee`` property is equal to ``null``.
   - Find tasks assigned to specific teammates Ali or Jamie by seeing if the ``assignee`` property is in a list of names.

   .. tabs-realm-languages::

      .. tab::
          :tabid: objective-c

          .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/QueryEngine.codeblock.comparison-operators.m
             :language: objective-c

      .. tab::
          :tabid: swift

          .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/QueryEngine.codeblock.comparison-operators.swift
             :language: swift


Logical Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can make compound predicates using logical operators.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - | ``and``
       | ``&&``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if both left-hand and right-hand expressions are ``true``.

   * - | ``not``
       | ``!``
     - Negates the result of the given expression.

   * - | ``or``
       | ``||``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if either expression returns ``true``.

.. example::

   We can use the query language's logical operators to find
   all of Ali's completed tasks. That is, we find all tasks
   where the ``assignee`` property value is equal to 'Ali' AND
   the ``isComplete`` property value is ``true``:

   .. tabs-realm-languages::

      .. tab::
          :tabid: objective-c

          .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/QueryEngine.codeblock.logical-operators.m
             :language: objective-c

      .. tab::
          :tabid: swift

          .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/QueryEngine.codeblock.logical-operators.swift
             :language: swift


String Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can compare string values using these string operators.
Regex-like wildcards allow more flexibility in search.

.. note::

   You can use the following modifiers with the string operators:

   - ``[c]`` for case insensitivity.

     .. code-block:: objective-c

        [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat: @"name CONTAINS[c] 'f'"]

   - ``[d]`` for diacritic insensitivity: Realm treats special characters as the base character (e.g. ``é`` -> ``e``).

     .. code-block:: objective-c

        [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat: @"name CONTAINS[d] 'e'"]


.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 60

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - | ``beginsWith``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string expression begins with the right-hand string expression. This is similar to ``contains``, but only matches if the left-hand string expression is found at the beginning of the right-hand string expression.

   * - | ``contains``, ``in``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string expression is found anywhere in the right-hand string expression.

   * - | ``endsWith``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string expression ends with the right-hand string expression. This is similar to ``contains``, but only matches if the left-hand string expression is found at the very end of the right-hand string expression.

   * - | ``like``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string expression
       matches the right-hand string wildcard string
       expression. A wildcard string expression is a string
       that uses normal characters with two special wildcard
       characters:

       - The ``*`` wildcard matches zero or more of any character
       - The ``?`` wildcard matches any character.

       For example, the wildcard string "d?g" matches "dog",
       "dig", and "dug", but not "ding", "dg", or "a dog".

   * - | ``==``, ``=``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string is lexicographically equal to the right-hand string.

   * - | ``!=``, ``<>``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string is not lexicographically equal to the right-hand string.

.. example::

   We use the query engine's string operators to find
   projects with a name starting with the letter 'e' and
   projects with names that contain 'ie':

   .. tabs-realm-languages::

      .. tab::
          :tabid: objective-c

          .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/QueryEngine.codeblock.string-operators.m
             :language: objective-c

      .. tab::
          :tabid: swift

          .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/QueryEngine.codeblock.string-operators.swift
             :language: swift


Aggregate Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can apply an aggregate operator to a collection property
of a Realm object. Aggregate operators traverse a
:ref:`collection <ios-client-collections>` and reduce it
to a single value.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 60

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - | ``@avg``
     - Evaluates to the average value of a given numerical property across a collection.

   * - | ``@count``
     - Evaluates to the number of objects in the given collection. This
       is currently only supported on :ref:`to-many relationship
       collections <ios-to-many-relationship>` and not on lists of
       primitives. In order to use ``@count`` on a list of primitives,
       consider wrapping the primitives in a :ref:`{+service-short+}
       object <ios-realm-objects>`.

   * - | ``@max``
     - Evaluates to the highest value of a given numerical property across a collection.

   * - | ``@min``
     - Evaluates to the lowest value of a given numerical property across a collection.

   * - | ``@sum``
     - Evaluates to the sum of a given numerical property across a collection.

.. example::

   We create a couple of filters to show different facets of
   the data:

   - Projects with average tasks priority above 5.
   - Long running projects.

   .. tabs-realm-languages::

      .. tab::
          :tabid: objective-c

          .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/QueryEngine.codeblock.aggregate-operators.m
             :language: objective-c

      .. tab::
          :tabid: swift

          .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/QueryEngine.codeblock.aggregate-operators.swift
             :language: swift


Set Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **set operator** uses specific rules to determine whether
to pass each input collection object to the output
collection by applying a given predicate to every element of
a given :ref:`list <ios-list-collections>` property of
the object.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - ``ALL``
     - Returns objects where the predicate evaluates to ``true`` for all objects in the collection.

   * - ``ANY``, ``SOME``
     - Returns objects where the predicate evaluates to ``true`` for any objects in the collection.

   * - ``NONE``
     - Returns objects where the predicate evaluates to false for all objects in the collection.


.. example::

   We use the query engine's set operators to find:

   - Projects with no complete tasks.
   - Projects with any top priority tasks.

   .. tabs-realm-languages::

      .. tab::
          :tabid: objective-c

          .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/QueryEngine.codeblock.set-operators.m
             :language: objective-c

      .. tab::
          :tabid: swift

          .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/code/start/QueryEngine.codeblock.set-operators.swift
             :language: swift


Summary
-------

- Realm accepts predicates based on NSPredicate to filter results.
- There are several categories of **operators** available to filter results: comparison, logical, string, aggregate, and set operators.

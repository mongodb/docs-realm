Overview
--------

This page contains instructions to quickly get {+client-database+} integrated
into your SwiftUI and Combine app. 

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- :ref:`Installed the iOS SDK <ios-install>` with a minimum iOS target of 14.0.

This quick start guide includes optional support for :ref:`{+sync+} <sync>`. If
you wish to integrate the quick start with {+sync+}, ensure you have:

- :ref:`Created a {+app+} <create-a-realm-app>`.
- :ref:`Enabled anonymous authentication <anonymous-authentication-configuration>`.
- :ref:`Enabled {+sync+} <enable-sync>`.

.. note::

   The code example presented below requires a minimum iOS target of 14.0, which
   requires Xcode 12 or later. You might be able to use iOS 13.x by adapting the
   code to remove iOS 14.0 features such as the ``SwiftUI.App`` class, but that
   is out of scope of this quick start guide.

The Code
--------

Paste the following into your main file, such as ``QuickStart.swift``. Delete
any other ``@main`` ``App`` classes that Xcode generated for your project (for
example, in MyProjectApp.swift). 

If you are using {+sync+}, find the ``USE_REALM_SYNC`` flag at the top of the
file and set it to ``true``. Update ``YOUR_REALM_APP_ID_HERE`` to your
:ref:`{+app+} ID <find-your-app-id>`. Run the app.

   :language: swift

The Explanation
---------------

App Flow
~~~~~~~~

If you opted in to using :ref:`{+sync+} <enable-sync>`, the first screen is the
LoginView. Otherwise, you start at the ItemsView.

In the LoginView, you can implement :ref:`email/password authentication
<ios-manage-email-password-users>` or :ref:`another authentication provider
<authentication-providers>`. For simplicity, the example uses
:ref:`Anonymous authentication <anonymous-authentication>`.

When you press the :guilabel:`Log in` button, the app navigates to the
ItemsView, where you see a list of **items** in a single **group**. The app
demonstrates a single group, but you can add more in the group management
screen.

On the ItemsView, you can log out (if using {+sync+}), edit the list, and add
items. Press the :guilabel:`Add` button on the bottom right of the screen to add
randomly generated items. Press the :guilabel:`Edit` button on the top right to
modify the list order, which the app persists in the {+realm+}. You can also
swipe to delete items.

When you have items in the list, you can press one of the items to navigate to
the ItemDetailsView. This is where you can modify the item name or mark it as a
favorite. Press the text field in the center of the screen and type a new name.
When you press Return, the item name should update across the app. You can also
toggle its favorite status by pressing the toggle in the top right.

.. note::

   If you are using {+sync+}, you can see the changes you make sync to the
   backend and across devices.

It's a small app, but it demonstrates a few key points about using Realm with
SwiftUI and Combine that we discuss in the following sections.

Models
~~~~~~

A common {+service-short+} data modeling use case is to have "things" and
"containers of things". This app defines two related Realm object models: item
and group.

An item has two user-facing properties:

- A randomly generated name, which the user can edit.
- An ``isFavorite`` boolean property, which indicates whether the user "favorited" the item.

A group contains items. You can extend the group to have a name and an
association with a specific user, but that is out of scope of this quick start.

State Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend keeping app state separate from Views as much as possible. A View
should only be aware of what it needs. We define the AppState class to
centralize the state of the app. As the app grows in complexity, we might
consider breaking functionality into smaller classes that become members of the
AppState class. For now, this class reports authentication events and holds the
list of items.

When the app launches, the AppState opens a {+realm+} if either of the following
conditions are true:

- A user from a previous session still logged in.
- We are not using {+sync+} and authentication at all.

Otherwise, the AppState opens a {+realm+} when a user logs in.

When opening a synced {+realm+} for the first time, it's a good idea to use
``asyncOpen()`` in order to download the {+realm+} completely from the backend
before opening it. When using the local-only {+realm+}, we can use the Realm
constructor directly.

Once the {+realm+} opens, the AppState retrieves the group in the {+realm+} or
creates one if one does not exist already. The AppState stores the list of items
in the group. Any views observing this state object refresh themselves in
response.

On logout, the AppState clears its reference to the items, and any views
observing this state object refresh themselves in response.

Views
~~~~~

Switching Views Depending on the App State
``````````````````````````````````````````

The ContentView is the main entrypoint of the app. It owns and observes an
instance of the AppState. It uses the AppState to determine which view to
present:

- If the AppState instance has a reference to the items of a group, we present the ItemsView.
- If the AppState instance does not have reference to the items of a group, we must be waiting for login and for the {+realm+} to open, so we present the LoginView.

When the AppState changes, this view renders again and has the opportunity to
present a different view based on the new state.

Handling Authentication ({+sync+})
````````````````````````````````````

The LoginView uses the {+app+} instance to log in anonymously. On success, it
forwards the event to the AppState's loginPublisher.

Likewise, the LogoutButton uses the {+app+} instance to log out and forward the
event to the AppState's logoutPublisher.

Presenting Lists of Realm Objects
`````````````````````````````````

The ItemsView receives the list of items from the ContentView and observes it.
You must :ref:`freeze <ios-frozen-objects>` a list when iterating over
it in a SwiftUI view, even if you do not modify the list while iterating.
Otherwise, unexpected behavior will occur when modifying the list, especially
when deleting objects.

.. note::

   To understand why freezing a list is necessary, consider that SwiftUI caches
   several copies of a list depending on the state of the view. When you delete
   from a list, the view still shows a cached copy of that list for a moment.
   However, :ref:`Realm lists are "live" <ios-live-collections>`, so the cached
   copy actually reflects the latest state of the Realm list. SwiftUI expects a
   cached list to reflect the previous state and assumes the number of elements
   in the list has not changed. Consequently, the view tries to display a list
   element that no longer exists. Freezing the list removes its "live" property,
   allowing the list copy to behave in line with SwiftUI's expectation.

Before passing each item to the ItemRow and ItemDetailsView views, we "thaw" the
frozen object by fetching it again from the {+realm+}. This is only necessary
because the ItemDetailsView may edit the item, and you cannot modify a frozen
item. However, we must be careful to treat the item as frozen until we intend to
modify it.

Note that the ItemRow and ItemDetailsView views do not observe their items.
That is, they do not declare the item as ``@ObservedObject var item: Item``
but rather ``var item: Item``. Otherwise, if these views observed an invalid
object caused by deleting an item, the app could crash.

.. important::

   Always treat the items in a list as "frozen" in SwiftUI views. When an item
   gets deleted, the view observing the list of items (ItemsView) will notice
   and re-render its list of ItemRows, so you do not need to and should not
   observe individual items in a list.


Modifying Properties of Presented Realm Objects
```````````````````````````````````````````````

The ItemDetailsView allows users to edit the name of an item with a TextField.
We use a ``@State`` variable to hold the new name value entered by a user. It's
important to avoid directly updating the item's ``name`` property here, because that
would result in an attempt to modify a Realm object outside of a transaction.

.. important:: 

   You may only update a Realm object's properties in a transaction. If
   we used the object's properties directly here, any edits to the TextField
   would automatically apply to the item's name outside of a transaction,
   resulting in a fatal exception.

There are two approaches to binding an editable Realm object property to a
SwiftUI control:

- Use another variable to hold the value until ready to commit it in a write transaction.
- Create a custom :apple:`binding <documentation/swiftui/binding>` that handles writes in a transaction.

We use the first approach to handle the update to the name because we want to
wait until the user actually commits the edit in the TextField before writing to
the {+realm+}.

Meanwhile, the user can also update the isFavorite property on the item using
the FavoriteToggle view. In this case, we want to write the update immediately
rather than waiting for the user to commit their edit in a TextField, so we
create a custom binding that handles writes in transactions.

Summary
-------

- The quick start demonstrates both local-only and {+sync+} use cases.
- Only provide views with the state they need. Avoid "wrapping" Realm where possible; use the SDK directly.
- Always :ref:`freeze <ios-frozen-objects>` a list when iterating over it. Do not observe iterated list items, or unexpected behavior will occur when modifying the list.
- Avoid using Realm object properties directly where they can be edited by the UI. Instead, store the new value in another variable until you're ready to commit the change in a transaction, or wrap the property in a custom binding that opens a transaction on write.

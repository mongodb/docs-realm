Realm Query Language
====================

Realm Query Language (RQL) is a string-based query language to constrain
searches when retrieving objects from a realm. SDK-specific methods pass queries
to the Realm query engine, which retrieves matching objects from the realm.
Realm Query Language syntax is based on `NSPredicate
<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nspredicate>`__.

Queries evaluate a predicate for every object in the collection being queried.
If the predicate resolves to ``true``, the results collection includes the object.

You can use Realm Query Language in most Realm SDKs with your SDK's filter
or query methods. The Swift SDK is the exception, as it uses the
:ref:`NSPredicate query API <ios-nspredicate-query>`.
Some SDKs also support idiomatic APIs for querying realms in their language.

to view, edit, and design Realm Database files.

Examples on This Page
---------------------

The examples in this page use a simple data set for a task list app.
The two Realm object types are ``Project`` and ``Task``.

- A ``Task`` has a name, assignee's name, and completed flag.
  There is also an arbitrary number for priority (higher is more important)
  and a count of minutes spent working on it.
- A ``Project`` has zero or more ``Tasks`` and an optional quota
  for minimum number of tasks expected to be completed.

See the schema for these two classes, ``Project`` and ``Task``, below:

Expressions
-----------

Filters consist of **expressions** in a predicate. An expression consists of
one of the following:

- The name of a property of the object currently being evaluated.
- An operator and up to two argument expression(s). For example, in the
  expression ``A + B``, the entirety of ``A + B`` is an expression, but ``A``
  and ``B`` are also argument expressions to the operator ``+``.
- A value, such as a string (``'hello'``) or a number (``5``).

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/realm-query-language/realm-query-language.snippet.predicate.js
   :language: javascript

Parameterized Queries
---------------------

Create parameterized queries to interpolate variables into prepared
Realm Query Language statements. The syntax for interpolated variables is
``$<int>``, starting at ``0``. Pass the positional arguments as
additional arguments to Realm SDK methods that use Realm Query Language.

Include just one parameter with ``$0``.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/realm-query-language/realm-query-language.snippet.predicate.js
   :language: js

Include multiple parameters with ascending integers starting at ``$0``.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/realm-query-language/realm-query-language.snippet.multiple-predicate.js
   :language: js

Dot Notation
------------

When referring to an object property, you can use **dot notation** to refer
to child properties of that object. You can even refer to the properties of
embedded objects and relationships with dot notation.

For example, consider a query on an object with a ``workplace`` property that
refers to a Workplace object. The Workplace object has an embedded object
property, ``address``. You can chain dot notations to refer to the zipcode
property of that address:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/realm-query-language/realm-query-language.snippet.deep-dot-notation.js
   :language: js

.. _rql-operators:
.. _rql-comparison-operators:

Comparison Operators
--------------------

The most straightforward operation in a search is to compare
values.

.. important:: Types Must Match

   The type on both sides of the operator must be equivalent. For
   example, comparing an ObjectId with string will result in a precondition
   failure with a message like:

   .. code-block::
      :copyable: false

      "Expected object of type object id for property 'id' on object of type
      'User', but received: 11223344556677889900aabb (Invalid value)"

   You can compare any numeric type with any other numeric type,
   including decimal, float, and Decimal128.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - ``BETWEEN {number1, number2}``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand numerical or date expression
       is between or equal to the right-hand range. For dates, this evaluates
       to ``true`` if the left-hand date is within the right-hand date range.

   * - | ``==``, ``=``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand expression is equal
       to the right-hand expression.

   * - | ``>``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand numerical or date expression
       is greater than the right-hand numerical or date expression.
       For dates, this evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand date is later
       than the right-hand date.

   * - | ``>=``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand numerical or date expression
       is greater than or equal to the right-hand numerical or date expression.
       For dates, this evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand date is later than
       or the same as the right-hand date.

   * - ``IN``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand expression is in the
       right-hand list or string.

   * - | ``<``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand numerical or date expression
       is less than the right-hand numerical or date expression.
       For dates, this evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand date is earlier
       than the right-hand date.

   * - | ``<=``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand numeric expression is less than
       or equal to the right-hand numeric expression. For dates, this evaluates
       to ``true`` if the left-hand date is earlier than or the same
       as the right-hand date.

   * - | ``!=``, ``<>``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand expression is not equal
       to the right-hand expression.

.. example::

   The following example uses Realm Query Language's comparison operators to:

   - Find high priority tasks by comparing the value of the ``priority``
     property value with a threshold number, above which priority can be considered high.
   - Find long-running tasks by seeing if the ``progressMinutes`` property
     is at or above a certain value.
   - Find unassigned tasks by finding tasks where the ``assignee`` property
     is equal to ``null``.
   - Find tasks within a certain time range by finding tasks where the
     ``progressMinutes`` property is between two numbers.

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/realm-query-language/realm-query-language.snippet.comparison-operators.js

.. _rql-logical-operators:

Logical Operators
-----------------

Make compound predicates using logical operators.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - | ``AND``
       | ``&&``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if both left-hand and right-hand expressions are ``true``.

   * - | ``NOT``
       | ``!``
     - Negates the result of the given expression.

   * - | ``OR``
       | ``||``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if either expression returns ``true``.

.. example::

   We can use the query language's logical operators to find
   all of Ali's completed tasks. That is, we find all tasks
   where the ``assignee`` property value is equal to 'Ali' AND
   the ``isComplete`` property value is ``true``:

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/realm-query-language/realm-query-language.snippet.logical-operators.js
      :language: javascript

.. _rql-string-operators:

String Operators
----------------

Compare string values using these string operators.
Regex-like wildcards allow more flexibility in search.

.. note::

   You can use the following modifiers with the string operators:

   - ``[c]`` for case insensitivity.

     .. code-block:: javascript

        "name CONTAINS[c] 'a'"

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 60

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - | ``BEGINSWITH``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string expression begins with
       the right-hand string expression. This is similar to ``contains``,
       but only matches if the right-hand string expression is found
       at the beginning of the left-hand string expression.

   * - | ``IN``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string expression is found
       anywhere in the right-hand string expression.

   * - | ``CONTAINS``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the right-hand string expression
       is found anywhere in the left-hand string expression.

   * - | ``ENDSWITH``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string expression ends
       with the right-hand string expression. This is similar to ``contains``,
       but only matches if the left-hand string expression is found
       at the very end of the right-hand string expression.

   * - | ``LIKE``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string expression
       matches the right-hand string wildcard string
       expression. A wildcard string expression is a string
       that uses normal characters with two special wildcard
       characters:

       - The ``*`` wildcard matches zero or more of any character
       - The ``?`` wildcard matches any character.

       For example, the wildcard string "d?g" matches "dog",
       "dig", and "dug", but not "ding", "dg", or "a dog".

   * - | ``==``, ``=``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string is lexicographically equal
       to the right-hand string.

   * - | ``!=``, ``<>``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand string is not lexicographically
       equal to the right-hand string.

.. example::

   We use the query engine's string operators to find:

   - Projects with a name starting with the letter 'e'
   - Projects with names that contain 'ie'

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/realm-query-language/realm-query-language.snippet.string-operators.js
      :language: javascript

.. _rql-objectid-uuid-operators:

ObjectId and UUID Operators
---------------------------

Query :manual:`BSON ObjectIds </reference/method/ObjectId>` and
:manual:`UUIDs </reference/method/UUID/>`.
These data types are often used as primary keys.

To query with ObjectIds, use a parameterized query. Pass the ObjectId or UUID
you're querying against as the argument.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/realm-query-language/realm-query-language.snippet.oid-literal.js
   :language: js

You can also put a string representation of the ObjectId you're evaluating
in ``oid(<ObjectId String>)``.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/realm-query-language/realm-query-language.snippet.oid.js
   :language: js

To query with UUIDs, put a string representation of the UUID you're evaluating
in ``uuid(<UUID String>)``.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/realm-query-language/realm-query-language.snippet.uuid.js
   :language: js

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 60

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - | ``==``, ``=``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand value is equal
       to the right-hand value.

   * - | ``!=``, ``<>``
     - Evaluates to ``true`` if the left-hand value is not equal
       to the right-hand value.

.. _rql-arithmetic-operators:

Arithmetic Operators
--------------------

Perform basic arithmetic in one side of a RQL expression when evaluating
numeric data types.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/realm-query-language/realm-query-language.snippet.basic-arithmetic.js
   :language: js

You can also use multiple object properties together in a mathematic operation.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/realm-query-language/realm-query-language.snippet.arithmetic-obj-properties.js
   :language: js

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 60

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - | ``*``
     - Multiplication.
   * - | ``/``
     - Division.
   * - | ``+``
     - Addition.
   * - | ``-``
     - Subtraction.
   * - | ``()``
     - Group expressions together.

.. _rql-type-operator:

Type Operator
-------------

Check the type of a property using the ``@type`` operator.
You can only use the type operator with mixed types and dictionaries.

Evaluate the property against a string representation of the data type name.
Refer to SDK documentation on the mapping from the SDK language's data types
to Realm data types.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 60

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - ``@type``
     - Check if type of a property is the property name as a string.
       Use ``==`` and ``!=`` to compare equality.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/realm-query-language/realm-query-language.snippet.type-operator.js
   :language: js

.. _rql-dictionary-operators:

Dictionary Operators
--------------------

Compare dictionary values using these dictionary operators.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 60

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - ``@values``
     - Returns objects that have the value specified in the right-hand expression.

   * - ``@keys``
     - Returns objects that have the key specified in the right-hand expression.

   * - ``@size``, ``@count``
     - The number of elements in a dictionary.

   * - ``Dictionary['key']``
     - Access the value at a key of a dictionary.

   * - ``ALL | ANY | NONE <property>.@type``
     - Checks if the dictionary contains any properties of certain type.

You can also use dictionary operators in combination with
:ref:`comparison operators <rql-comparison-operators>` to filter objects
based on dictionary keys and values. The following examples show some ways
to use dictionary operators with comparison operators. All examples query
a collection of Realm objects with a dictionary property named ``dict``.

TODO(DOCSP-20137): literalinclude

.. code-block:: js

   // Evaluates if all the dictionary's values are integers
   "ALL dict.@type == 'int'"

   // Evaluates if there is a dictionary key with the name 'Foo'
   "ANY dict.@keys == 'Foo'"

   // ANY is implied. All have int values.
   "dict.@type == 'int'"

   // Evaluates if dictionary does not have any values of type int
   "NONE dict.@type == 'int'"

   // Evaluates if dictionary has property of type 'string'
   "ANY dict.@type == 'string'"

.. _rql-date-operators:

Date Operators
--------------

Query date types in a realm.

Generally, you should use parameterized query to pass a date data type
from the SDK language you are using to a query.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/realm-query-language/realm-query-language.snippet.date-parameterized-query.js
   :language: js

You can also represent dates the following ways:

- ``YYYY-MM-DD@HH:mm:ss:nnnnnnnnnn`` (year-month-day@hours:minutes:seconds:nanoseconds), UTC.
  You can also use ``T`` instead of ``@`` to separate the date from the time.
- ``Ts:n``, where ``s`` is the number of seconds and n the number of nanoseconds
  since :wikipedia:`unix epoch <Unix_time>`.

Date supports :ref:`comparison operators <rql-comparison-operators>`.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/realm-query-language/realm-query-language.snippet.date-alt-representation.js
   :language: js

.. _rql-aggregate-operators:

Aggregate Operators
-------------------

Apply an aggregate operator to a collection property of a Realm
object. Aggregate operators traverse a collection and reduce it to a
single value.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 60

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - | ``@avg``
     - Evaluates to the average value of a given numerical property across
       a collection. If any values are ``null``, they are not counted
       in the result.

   * - | ``@count``
     - Evaluates to the number of objects in the given collection.

   * - | ``@max``
     - Evaluates to the highest value of a given numerical property
       across a collection. ``null`` values are ignored.

   * - | ``@min``
     - Evaluates to the lowest value of a given numerical property
       across a collection. ``null`` values are ignored.

   * - | ``@sum``
     - Evaluates to the sum of a given numerical property across a collection,
       excluding ``null`` values.

.. example::

   These examples all query for projects containing tasks that meet
   this criteria:

   - Projects with average task priority above 5.
   - Projects with a task whose priority is less than 5.
   - Projects with a task whose priority is greater than 5.
   - Projects with more than 5 tasks.
   - Projects with long-running tasks.

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/realm-query-language/realm-query-language.snippet.aggregate-operators.js
      :language: javascript

.. _rql-collection-operators:

Collection Operators
--------------------

A **collection operator** lets you query list properties within a collection of objects.
Collection operators filter a collection by applying a predicate
to every element of a given list property of the object.
If the predicate returns true, the object is included in the output collection.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - ``ALL``
     - Returns objects where the predicate evaluates to ``true`` for all objects
       in the collection.

   * - ``ANY``, ``SOME``
     - Returns objects where the predicate evaluates to ``true`` for any objects
       in the collection.

   * - ``NONE``
     - Returns objects where the predicate evaluates to false for all objects
       in the collection.


.. example::

   This example uses collection operators to find projects that contain tasks
   matching certain criteria:

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/realm-query-language/realm-query-language.snippet.set-operators.js
      :language: js


.. _rql-subqueries:

Subqueries
----------

Iterate through list properties with another query using the
``SUBQUERY()`` predicate function.

Subqueries are useful for the following scenarios:

- Matching each object in a list property on multiple conditions
- Counting the number of objects that match a subquery


``SUBQUERY()`` has the following structure:

.. code-block:: js

   SUBQUERY(<collection>, <variableName>, <predicate>)

- ``collection``: The name of the property to iterate through
- ``variableName``: A variable name of the element to use in the subquery
- ``predicate``: The subquery predicate.
  Use the variable specified by ``variableName`` to refer to the
  currently-iterated element.

A subquery iterates through the given collection and checks the given predicate
against each object in the collection. The predicate can refer to the current
iterated object with the variable name passed to ``SUBQUERY()``.

A subquery expression resolves to a list of objects.
Realm Database only supports the ``@count`` aggregate operator on the result
of a subquery. This allows you to count how many objects in the subquery
input collection matched the predicate.

You can use the count of the subquery result as you would any other number
in a valid expression. In particular, you can compare the count with the
number ``0`` to return all matching objects.


.. example::

   The following example shows two subquery filters on a collection of projects.

   .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/realm-query-language/realm-query-language.snippet.subquery.js
      :language: js

.. _rql-sort-distinct-limit:

Sort, Distinct & Limit
----------------------

Sort and limit the results collection of your query using additional operators.

   * - Operator
     - Description

   * - ``SORT``
     - Specify the name of the property to compare. You can optionally
       specify ascending (``ASC``) or descending (``DESC``) order.
       If you specify multiple SORT fields, the query sorts by the first
       field, and then the second. For example, if you ``SORT (priority, name)``,
       the query returns sorted by priority, and then by name when priority
       value is the same.

   * - ``DISTINCT``
     - Specify a name of the property to compare. Remove duplicates
       for that property in the results collection. If you specify multiple
       DISTINCT fields, the query removes duplicates by the first field, and
       then the second. For example, if you ``DISTINCT (name, assignee)``,
       the query only removes duplicates where the values of both properties
       are the same.

   * - ``LIMIT``
     - Limit the results collection to the specified number.

.. example::

   Use the query engine's sort, distinct, and limit operators to find tasks
   where the assignee is Ali:

   - Sorted by priority in descending order
   - Enforcing uniqueness by name
   - Limiting the results to 5 tasks

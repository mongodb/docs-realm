Overview
--------

{+service+} uses a deployment-based versioning scheme that allows you to
group updates to your application and make them available to client
applications at the same time. You can deploy a new version of your
application with multiple deployment methods that each fit a particular
development workflow. You can also review the historical state of your
application based on the built-in deployment history log.

Concepts
--------

.. _deployment-methods:

Deployment Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can deploy new versions of your application through the {+ui+} or
one of multiple code-based deployment methods that each suit a
particular development workflow.

   * - Deployment Method
     - Details

   * - {+ui+}
     - .. admonition:: Use This Method If
          :class: reference-block

          - You want to use a browser-based GUI to develop and manage
            your {+app+}.

       .. admonition:: Deployment Pattern
          :class: reference-block

          *For a detailed walkthrough, see* :doc:`Deploy from the {+ui+}
          </deploy/deploy-ui>`

          1. Make changes in the UI that are saved in a draft state
             and not visible to client apps.

          2. Review all draft changes and then deploy them together
             through the {+ui+}.

   * - Automatic GitHub Deployment
     - .. admonition:: Use This Method If
          :class: reference-block

          - You want to use a code-first approach to app development.
          - You want to use Git to version control your app.
          - You want to automatically deploy changes when you push to
            :github:`GitHub <>`.

       .. admonition:: Deployment Pattern
          :class: reference-block

          *For a detailed walkthrough, see* :doc:`Deploy Automatically
          with GitHub </deploy/deploy-automatically-with-github>`

          1. Host your exported application repository on GitHub.

          2. Add, remove, or modify configuration files in a local clone
             of the repository to specify your updated application.

          3. When you've made all the changes that you want to, commit
             them and push the changes to GitHub.

   * - {+cli-bin+}
     - .. admonition:: Use This Method If
          :class: reference-block

          - You want to use a code-first approach to app development.
          - You want to use a command line interface to manage and
            deploy your {+app+}.

       .. admonition:: Deployment Pattern
          :class: reference-block

          *For a detailed walkthrough, see* :doc:`Deploy Changes with
          {+cli+} </deploy/deploy-cli>`

          1. Export a copy of your application to a directory of
             configuration files and download it to your computer.

          2. Add, remove, or modify configuration files in the directory
             to specify your updated application.

          3. When you've made all the changes that you want to,
             manually deploy them by importing the updated application
             directory.

   * - {+service-short+} Admin API
     - .. admonition:: Use This Method If
          :class: reference-block

          - You want to use a code-first approach to app development.
          - You want to use an HTTP API to manage and deploy your {+app+}.

       .. admonition:: Deployment Pattern
          :class: reference-block

          *For a detailed walkthrough, see* :ref:`Draft and Deploy a
          Group of Changes <admin-api-draft-deploy>`

          1. Create a new draft deployment through the API.

          2. Add, remove, or modify components of your application by
             calling relevant HTTP endpoints.

          3. When you've made all the changes that you want to,
             deploy the draft through the API.

.. _app-components:

Application Components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+app+}s are composed of components like
:doc:`Functions </functions>`, :doc:`Triggers </triggers>`,
:doc:`Auth Providers </authentication>`, and :doc:`Values
</values-and-secrets>`. A deployment consist of at least one
new, updated, or deleted component.

.. _app-config:
.. _application-config:
.. _config-files:

Configuration Files
+++++++++++++++++++

{+service+} uses **configuration files** to define your application's
metadata and components. Every component is defined by its own
configuration file and each type of component uses a distinct
configuration file schema. The {+ui+} manages your application's
configuration files for you, but you can also use a code-based
deployment method to update your application by adding, modifying, and
deleting configuration files directly.

.. _application-directory:
.. _app-directory:

Application Directory
+++++++++++++++++++++

{+app+}s are structured in a nested directory format called
an **application directory** that contains configuration files for your
application components. The configuration files are grouped into
directories based on their component type. You can download a copy of
the application directory for the most recently deployed version of an
app by :doc:`exporting </deploy/export-realm-app>` it from the
{+ui+} or {+cli-bin+}, or by cloning the underlying Git repository.

For additional information on the structure of an application directory
as well as the schema of each configuration file type, see
:doc:`Application Configuration Files
</deploy/application-configuration-files>`.

.. _deployment-history:

Deployment History
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+backend+} logs every deployment of an application and exposes a list of the
100 most recent deployments in the :guilabel:`History` tab of the
:guilabel:`Deploy` in the {+ui+}. Each deployment log includes data
about a set of changes, such as their status, origin, and time of
deployment.

If you choose to deploy through the {+ui+}, any changes you make are
grouped in a row at the top of the deployment history table that
represents draft changes made since the previous deployment. You can use
the :guilabel:`Action`  buttons on this row to manually deploy all draft
changes.

Summary
-------

- Deployment allows you to group updates to your application and make them available to client applications at the same time in a new version.
- {+service-short+} provides four ways to deploy depending on your project's workflow: {+ui+} deployment, automatic GitHub deployment, {+cli-bin+} deployment, and {+service-short+} Admin API deployment.
- A deployment consists of at least one new, updated, or deleted {+service-short+} component such as a Function, Trigger, Auth Provider, or Value.
- {+service-short+} tracks deployment history up to 100 versions, allowing you to review past changes.

Overview
--------

{+service+} stores data on the filesystem in **auxiliary files**.
You can access these files through the {+service-short+} SDK. In some error
situations detailed below, you might need to manually delete the
auxiliary files. Otherwise, these are implementation details that you
can safely ignore, presented here only for the curious.

Auxiliary File Types
--------------------

{+service+}'s internal operation depends on several auxiliary file
types:

``<path>.realm``:
  The **{+realm+} file** contains the data and metadata of
  the {+realm+} at the given :ref:`{+service-short+} path
  <react-native-realm-path>`. Each app can have several
  {+realms+} at different paths, each with their own
  {+realm+} file.

``<name>.realm.lock``:
  The **lock file** enables synchronization between writes.

``<name>.realm.note``:
  The **note file** is a :wikipedia:`named pipe
  <Named_pipe>` for inter-thread and inter-process
  notifications. While usually completely internal, the note
  file can cause the "unsupported resource found" error in
  iOS builds if you accidentally add it to the app bundle.
  If you see this error, delete the pipe.

``<name>.realm.management``:
  The **management directory** contains internal files for
  the {+realm+}'s state management.

Manually Deleting Auxiliary Files
---------------------------------

In some circumstances, you might need to delete the
auxiliary files. You may delete auxiliary files when the {+realm+} is
closed. Deleting any of a {+realm+}'s files while the {+realm+} is
open might corrupt the {+realm+} or disrupt :doc:`Sync
</sync>`.

.. _react-native-client-reset:

Client Reset Scenario
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using :doc:`{+sync+} </sync>`, a **client
reset** is a serious error recovery task that your client
app must perform in the following situation:

- The given synced {+realm+} on the server was restored from a backup.
  For example, due to a {+service-short+} server crash.

- The client app made changes to that {+realm+} since the backup was made,
  but did not sync those changes back to the server before the server
  was restored.

In other words, the client app must carry out a client reset
on a given synced {+realm+} if the server is restored to a
version older than the version on the client.

To perform a client reset, follow these steps:

1. Create a backup of the local {+realm+} file.

#. Delete the local {+realm+} file.

#. The next time the app connects to the server and opens that {+realm+},
   the app downloads a fresh copy of the {+realm+} file. The local changes
   made since the backup on the server are not reflected in the new file.

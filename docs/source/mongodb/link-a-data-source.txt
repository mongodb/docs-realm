Link a MongoDB Data Source

Overview
--------

You can use {+service+} to work with a **data source** -- either a
`{+atlas+} <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?tck=docs_realm>`_
cluster or `Data Lake
<https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/data-lake?tck=docs_realm>`_ associated
with the same Atlas project as your {+app+}. To connect to a data source
through {+service-short+}, you must first link it to a new MongoDB
service in your application.

You can create a MongoDB service and link a data source to your {+app+}
through the {+ui+} or with an :doc:`import/export </deploy/deploy-cli>`
configuration directory. Select the tab below that corresponds to the
method you want to use.

.. admonition:: Version 4.4 Required for Sync
   :class: note

   In order to use {+sync+}, your Atlas cluster must use MongoDB version
   4.4.

Procedure
---------

.. tabs-realm-admin-interfaces::

   tabs:
     - id: ui
       content: |
         .. include:: /includes/steps/link-a-data-source-realm-ui.rst

     - id: cli
       content: |
         .. include:: /includes/steps/link-a-data-source-import-export.rst

{+service-short+} will immediately begin the process of linking to the
data source, which could take up to five minutes. Once {+service-short+}
is finished linking to the data source, you can start working with the
data.

.. _data-lake-caveats:

Linked Data Lake Considerations
-------------------------------

For the most part, you can interact with a linked Data Lake just as
you would with a linked Atlas cluster. However, there are some
caveats to keep in mind when working with a Data Lake:

- Data Lakes :datalake:`do not support write operations <supported-unsupported/mql-support>`.
- You can only access a linked Data Lake from a :ref:`system function <system-functions>`.
- You cannot connect to the Data Lake via the wire protocol.
- You cannot define :ref:`roles and permissions <define-roles-and-permissions>` for a linked Data Lake.
- You cannot set a :ref:`Read Preference <read-preference>` for a linked Data Lake.

Work with a Linked Data Source
------------------------------

The following pages demonstrate how to start working with your
linked data source from a :ref:`function <functions>`:

.. see::

   - :doc:`Insert Documents </mongodb/insert-documents>`
   - :doc:`Find Documents </mongodb/find-documents>`
   - :doc:`Update Documents </mongodb/update-documents>`
   - :doc:`Delete Documents </mongodb/delete-documents>`
   - :doc:`Run Aggregation Pipelines </mongodb/run-aggregation-pipelines>`

You can access your MongoDB data source remotely from a client. See the
following sections of the Client Guides:

.. see::

   - :ref:`android-mongodb-data-access` (Android SDK)
   - :ref:`ios-client-remote` (iOS SDK)
   - :ref:`node-mongodb-data-access` (Node SDK)
   - :ref:`react-native-mongodb-data-access` (React Native SDK)

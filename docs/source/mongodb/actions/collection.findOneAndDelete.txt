Definition
----------

.. method:: collection.findOneAndDelete()

Remove a single document from a collection based on a query filter and
return a document with the same form as the document immediately before
it was deleted. Unlike :method:`collection.deleteOne()`, this action
allows you to atomically find and delete a document with the same
command. This avoids the risk of other update operations changing the
document between separate :doc:`find </mongodb/actions/collection.find>`
and :doc:`delete </mongodb/actions/collection.deleteOne>` operations.

Usage
-----

Example
~~~~~~~

To call the ``collection.findOneAndDelete()`` action from a
:doc:`Function </functions>`, get a collection handle with
:method:`database.collection()` then call the handle's
``findOneAndUpdate()`` method.

.. include:: /mongodb/crud-snippets/findOneAndDelete/functions.rst

Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~

The ``collection.findOneAndDelete()`` action has the following
form:

.. code-block:: javascript

   findOneAndDelete(query, options)

.. include:: /includes/extracts/mongodb-action-params-findOneAndDelete-function.rst

Return Value
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``collection.findOneAndDelete()`` action returns a :mdn:`Promise
<Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise>` that resolves to a
single document that the query deleted. If no documents match the
specified query, the promise resolves to ``null``.

.. code-block:: javascript

   Promise<document|null>

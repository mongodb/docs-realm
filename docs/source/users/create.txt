Create an Email/Password User
-----------------------------

For most :doc:`authentication providers </authentication/providers>`,
when an end-user authenticates for the first time, the user object is
created.  For the :doc:`Email/Password authentication provider
</authentication/email-password>`, a prompt requires users to create an
account the first time they connect to your :term:`{+app+}`.

For testing and debugging with the Email/Password authentication
provider, create new users from within the {+service-short+} admin console
by following the steps below:


#. Select :guilabel:`Users` from the left-side navigation.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Add New User` button.

#. Specify an email address and password for the new user.

   .. note::

      The Email/Password authentication provider requires passwords to be
      between 6 and 128 characters long.

#. Click :guilabel:`Create`.

.. note::
   
   You can also create API keys that applications use to connect to your
   {+app+}. Although API Keys are not associated with
   a single user, the :guilabel:`Users` tab lists them. To learn more
   about API keys, see :doc:`API Key Authentication
   </authentication/api-key>`.

Confirm a User
--------------

You must confirm the email address of new
:doc:`Email/Password users </authentication/email-password>`
before they are permitted to log into {+service+}. The
exact method of confirmation depends upon your provider
configuration, but typically involves a
:wikipedia:`handshake process <Handshaking>` between the
user and your application. You can read more about
Email/Password user confirmation at :ref:`Email/Password
Confirmation <email-password-authentication-confirmation>`.

Sometimes, however, users are unable to complete the confirmation
process. For example:

- An overzealous spam filter might block {+service+} email confirmation
  emails.

- A proxy or web blocker could prevent a user from activating the
  ``confirmUser`` client SDK function via the client application.

- an implementation error could cause the client application's user
  confirmation page to fail for specific use cases.

To help you work around cases like this, {+service+} allows you to confirm
users manually by following the below steps:

#. Select :guilabel:`Users` from the left-hand navigation.

#. Under the :guilabel:`Users` tab, select the :guilabel:`PENDING`
   button.

#. Find the user in the list and click on the ellipsis (``...``).

#. Select the :guilabel:`Confirm User` option from the context menu that
   appears.

#. If the operation succeeds, the banner at the top of the {+service-short+}
   admin console should display a confirmation message. The user's
   :guilabel:`User Status` changes from :guilabel:`Pending Confirmation`
   to :guilabel:`Pending User Login`.

A manually confirmed user continues to appear in the :guilabel:`PENDING`
user list until they log in to your application for the first time, at
which point {+backend+} moves them into the list of confirmed users and
transitions their :guilabel:`User Status` to ``confirmed``.

Re-run the User Confirmation Workflow
-------------------------------------

A few circumstances can lead to incomplete Email/Password user
confirmation workflows:

- An email is caught by a spam filter, not delivered due to a bug, or
  accidentally deleted by a prospective {+service-short+} user.

- A custom confirmation function is unable to communicate with an
  unconfirmed user due to a bug or oversight.

- An unconfirmed user forgot to visit their confirmation link within 30
  minutes of receiving their login tokens, and the tokens expired.

Users caught in this situation appear stuck in an unconfirmed state.
Since an existing account has their email registered to it, users cannot
create a new account with the same email address. Also, they cannot log
into an account that is not confirmed.

Applications that use {+service+}'s built-in email confirmation service
can use the ``resendConfirmationEmail`` Client SDK method to send a new
email with a new confirmation link to the user, allowing them to confirm
their account and log in. Calling this method will result in an error by
any application using a confirmation flow other than ``send a
confirmation email``.

There is no such specific method to re-run a custom confirmation
function. Instead, {+service+} has a method to trigger a re-run of whatever
the current Email/Password user confirmation workflow happens to be. You
can manually re-run the currently selected user confirmation flow using
the :doc:`{+service-short+} Admin API </admin/api/v3>` or via the {+ui+}:

To re-run the confirmation workflow for a user through the {+ui+}:

#. Select :guilabel:`Users` from the left-hand navigation.

#. Under the :guilabel:`Users` tab, select the :guilabel:`PENDING`
   button.

#. Find the user in the list and click on the ellipsis (``...``).

#. Select the :guilabel:`Run user confirmation` option from the context
   menu that appears.

#. Select the :guilabel:`Run User Confirmation` button in the dialogue
   box that appears.

#. If the operation succeeds, the banner at the top of the {+service-short+}
   admin console should display a confirmation message. The user's
   :guilabel:`User Status` changes from :guilabel:`Pending Confirmation`
   to :guilabel:`Pending User Login`. Once the user logs in, they will
   move into the active users list automatically.

If the re-run fails or the user's tokens expire again, you can re-run
the confirmation function as many times as necessary.

Summary
-------

- The Email/Password authentication provider requires users to create an
  account the first time they connect to your {+app+}

- Email/Password users must be confirmed manually through the {+ui+}

- Users caught in an incomplete Email/Password confirmation workflow
  must re-run the confirmation through the {+ui+}

Overview
--------
Realm Sync lets you share data across devices, between Realm clients and
a synced MongoDB Atlas cluster and is a solution for offline-first app
development. To learn more about Realm Sync, see :doc:`Sync
Overview </sync/overview>`.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you can access a synced {+realm+} from the client, you must:

- :ref:`Enable sync <enable-sync>` in the {+ui+}.

- :ref:`Initialize the app <node-quick-start-init-app>` and :ref:`authenticate a
  user <node-quick-start-authenticate>` in your client project.

Open a Synced Realm
-------------------

To open a synced :term:`{+realm+}` for a given :term:`partition value`,
initialize a ``Realm`` by passing a configuration object to
"realm.open". The config object should have a sync field that is an
object with the authenticated user, and the partition value as fields:

.. code-block:: javascript

   const config = {
      schema: [MySchema],
      sync: {
        user: user,
        partitionValue: partitionValue,
      },
    };
   try {
      let realm = await Realm.open(config);
   } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
   }

The :ref:`partition value <partitioning>` specifies which subset of your data to sync.
This is typically a user ID, project ID, store ID, or some other category identifier in
your app that has particular relevance to the current user. 

.. seealso:: :ref:`Partition Atlas Data into Realms <partitioning>`

Sync Data
---------
The syntax to :ref:`read <node-realm-database-reads>`, :ref:`write
<node-realm-database-writes>`, and :ref:`watch for changes <node-client-notifications>` on a
synced {+realm+} is identical to the syntax for non-synced {+realms+}. While you work with
local data, {+service-short+} efficiently integrates, uploads, and downloads changesets.

The following code reads a collection of ``Task`` objects, watches that collection for
changes, then writes a new ``Task`` to the {+realm+}:

.. code-block:: javascript

  // open a realm with the config object with a synced field
  let realm = await Realm.open(config);

  const syncTasks = realm.objects("Task");

  // Watch for changes. No special syntax required for synced realms.
  realm.addListener("change", () => {
    console.log("sync tasks - ", syncTasks);
  });
  realm.write(() => {
    realm.deleteAll();
  });
  // Write to the realm. No special syntax required for synced realms.
  realm.write(() => {
    realm.create("Task", {
      name: "buy groceries",
      description: "go to store and buy milk, eggs and bread",
    });
  });

  // remove listeners and close the synced realm when done observing
  realm.removeAllListeners();
  realm.close();

Session Multiplexing
--------------------

Some {+service-short+} applications, such as event handlers, require the
ability to open large numbers of {+realm+}s. Normally, each {+realm+}
uses a single websocket connection to synchronize data. However, applications
that open a large number of realms can consume a disproportionate amount
of network resources to synchronize all of those {+realm+}s simultaneously.

To reduce this network load, you can enable :js-sdk:`session multiplexing
<Realm.Sync.html#.enableSessionMultiplexing>` in
your application. Session multiplexing uses a single connection for
all realms synchronized by your application. To enable session multiplexing,
call the ``Realm.Sync.enableSessionMultiplexing()`` static method on startup
before instantiating any {+realm+} connections.

Summary
-------

- Open a synced {+realm+} by creating a config object with a sync sub-object that has a :term:`partition value`.
- The syntax for reading from, writing to, or watching objects on a synced {+realm+} is the same as the syntax for a non-synced {+realm+}

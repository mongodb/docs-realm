As you develop a :term:`{+app+}`, you might want to share the
codebase with team members, make a backup, or work with a
version control system like Git. {+service+}'s export
functionality makes this possible.

You can export {+app+}s to a local application
directory from the {+ui+} or with the {+cli-bin+}
:ref:`export <realm-cli-export>` command.

Exported application directories use the same name as the {+app+}
by default. Every configuration file must conform to its
:doc:`configuration file schema
</deploy/application-configuration-files>`.

Procedure
---------

Export from the Realm UI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The simplest way to export a {+app+} is directly from the
{+ui+}. To do so, click :guilabel:`Deploy` in the left-hand
navigation, select the :guilabel:`Import/Export App` tab, and then click
the :guilabel:`Export App` button.

Export with {+cli-bin+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+app+}s can be exported programmatically via the
:doc:`Command Line Interface </deploy/realm-cli-reference>`
({+cli-bin+}).

Before beginning, ensure that you have properly :ref:`installed
<install-realm-cli>` {+cli-bin+}.

Output
------

Your application will be exported to a local application directory. If
you did not specify a path for the directory with ``--output``, it will
be exported with the same name as the application into the current
working directory.

Only entities that are configured in your application will appear in
your exported application directory. See :doc:`Application Configuration
Files </deploy/application-configuration-files>` for more information on
the schema and contents of {+app+}s.

Summary
-------

- You can use {+service-short+}'s export functionality to share your codebase, make a backup, or work with a version control system.
- You can export {+app+}s with the {+ui+} or with the {+cli-bin+} :ref:`export <realm-cli-export>` command.

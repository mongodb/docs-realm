title: Add Realm as a Dependency in Your Cartfile
ref: update-cartfile
content: |

   Add {+service-short+} as a dependency by appending the line ``github
   "realm/realm-cocoa"`` to your Cartfile.
   
   You can create a Cartfile or append to an existing one by
   running the following command in your project directory:
   
   .. code-block:: bash
      
      echo 'github "realm/realm-cocoa"' >> Cartfile

   From the command line, run ``carthage update`` to fetch
   the dependencies.

   Carthage pulls the dependencies into a platform directory
   (e.g. "Mac" for macOS) within a ``Carthage/Build/``
   directory.

   Open your project's ``xcodeproj`` file in Xcode. Go to
   the Project Navigator panel and click your application
   name to open the project settings editor. Select the
   :guilabel:`General` tab.

   In Finder, open your target platform's directory within
   the ``Carthage/Build/`` directory. Drag the
   ``RealmSwift.framework`` and ``Realm.framework`` files
   found in that directory to the :guilabel:`Frameworks,
   Libraries, and Embedded Content` section of your
   project's :guilabel:`General` settings.

title: Enable the Copy Frameworks Script (iOS, tvOS, and watchOS only)
ref: enable-copy-frameworks

   To work around an `App Store submission bug
   <http://www.openradar.me/radar?id=6409498411401216>`__
   for iOS, tvOS, and watchOS apps, you must add a script to
   copy the frameworks as a build phase.

   In Xcode, select the :guilabel:`Build Phases` tab in the
   project settings editor. Click the :guilabel:`+` icon and
   choose "New Run Script Phase" to create a new script. In
   the source input box for the new script, paste the
   following snippet:

   .. code-block:: bash

      /usr/local/bin/carthage copy-frameworks

   In the :guilabel:`Input Files` box below the source
   input box, add the paths to the frameworks for your
   target platform. If you are not targeting iOS, change
   "iOS" in the paths below to "tvOS" or "watchOS":

   .. tabs-realm-languages::
     
     .. tab::
         :tabid: swift

         .. code-block:: text
            
            $(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/Realm.framework
            $(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/RealmSwift.framework

     .. tab::
         :tabid: objective-c

         .. code-block:: text
            
            $(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/Realm.framework

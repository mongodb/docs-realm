     * - Action
       - Description

     * - :method:`mongodb.db()`

       - Return a database handle object that represents a database in a
         :doc:`linked MongoDB data source </mongodb/link-a-data-source>`. Call
         :method:`database.collection()` on the database handle to retrieve a
         collection handle.

     * - :method:`database.collection()`

       - Return a collection handle object that represents a collection
         in a :method:`database <mongodb.db()>`.

     * - :method:`collection.find()`

       - Find all documents in a collection or :manual:`view </core/views>` that
         match the provided query predicates and return a
         :term:`cursor` that points to them.

     * - :method:`collection.findOne()`

       - Return a single document from a collection or :manual:`view
         </core/views>`. If multiple documents satisfy the query, this
         method returns the first document according to the query's
         sort order or :term:`natural order`.

     * - :method:`collection.findOneAndUpdate()`

       - Update a single document in a collection or :manual:`view
         </core/views>` based on a query filter and return the document
         in either its pre-update or post-update form. Unlike
         :method:`collection.updateOne()`, this action allows you to
         atomically find, update, and return a document with the same
         command.

     * - :method:`collection.findOneAndReplace()`

       - Overwrite a single document in a collection or :manual:`view
         </core/views>` based on a query filter and return the document
         in either its pre-replacement or post-replacement form. Unlike
         :method:`collection.updateOne()`, this action allows you to
         atomically find, replace, and return a document with the same
         command.

     * - :method:`collection.findOneAndDelete()`

       - Remove a single document from a collection based on a query
         filter and return a document with the same form as the
         document immediately before it was deleted. Unlike
         :method:`collection.deleteOne()`, this action allows you to
         atomically find and delete a document with the same command.

     * - :method:`collection.count()`

       - Return the number of documents in a collection or :manual:`view
         </core/views>` that match the specified query filter.

     * - :method:`collection.insertOne()`

       - Insert a single document into a collection and return the ``_id`` of the
         inserted document.

     * - :method:`collection.insertMany()`

       - Insert one or more documents into a collection and return a list of the
         ``_id`` values for each inserted document.

     * - :method:`collection.updateOne()`

       - Update a single document in a collection based on a query filter.

     * - :method:`collection.updateMany()`

       - Update one or more documents in a collection based on a query filter.

     * - :method:`collection.deleteOne()`

       - Remove a single document from the collection based on a query filter.

     * - :method:`collection.deleteMany()`

       - Remove one or more documents from the collection based on a query filter.

     * - :method:`collection.aggregate()`

       - Execute an :manual:`aggregation </aggregation>` pipeline and return a
         :term:`cursor` that points to the result.

     * - :method:`collection.distinct()`

       - Return a list of distinct values for the given key within a collection.

     If present, the ``body`` is returned as a ``BSON.binary`` type. To
     retrieve the response as a string, use the ``BSON.binary.text()``
     method. If the text represents extended JSON, it can be decoded by with
     ``EJSON.parse()``.

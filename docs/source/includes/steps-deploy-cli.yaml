  :doc:`Export </deploy/export-realm-app>` your application to a local
  application directory. Alternatively, create a new application
  directory that contains a :ref:`config.json <appschema-realm-config>`
  file with your application's ``app_id``.

  .. code-block:: json

     {
       "app_id": "<Your Application ID>"

title: Add or Update Application Entities
ref: add-update-application-entities

title: Authenticate a MongoDB Atlas User
ref: authenticate-atlas-user
content: |
  To import or update a {+app+} with {+cli-bin+}, users
  must authenticate with `{+atlas+} <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?tck=docs_realm>`_
  using an API Key.

  .. code-block:: shell

     realm-cli login --api-key="<my api key>" --private-api-key="<my private api key>"

title: Run the Import Command
ref: run-import-command
content: |
  Use the {+cli-bin+} :ref:`import <realm-cli-import>` to deploy
  your changes:

  .. code-block:: shell
     
     realm-cli import --strategy=merge

  .. admonition:: Import Strategy
     :class: note
     
     The ``--strategy`` flag indicates how you want {+service-short+} to handle
     configuration files that are missing or duplicated compared to the
     currently deployed version of your application. For more
     information, see :ref:`import strategies
     <realm-import-strategies>`.

  If you want to :doc:`upload static assets to {+service-short+} Hosting
  </hosting/upload-content-to-realm>`, include the static assets in the
  ``/hosting/files`` directory and specify the
  :option:`--include-hosting <realm-cli import --include-hosting>`
  option:

  .. code-block:: shell

     realm-cli import --strategy=merge --include-hosting

  If you want to :doc:`upload external dependencies
  </functions/upload-external-dependencies>`, include your archived
  ``node_modules`` in the ``/functions`` directory and specify the
  :option:`--include-dependencies
  <realm-cli import --include-dependencies>` option:

  .. code-block:: shell

     realm-cli import --strategy=merge --include-dependencies
---
title: Review and Confirm Import Diff
ref: confirm-import-diff
content: |
  Before committing the import, {+cli-bin+} will show you a diff of
  the changes that will be made to your application. Review the diff to
  ensure that all changes are correct then confirm the import.

  After successfully importing your application, {+service-short+} will
  automatically deploy a new version of your app and update your local
  application directory to match the new deployment.

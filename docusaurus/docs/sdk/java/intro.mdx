description: Build Android applications with Realm in Java or Kotlin.
---

With the [Java SDK](https://github.com/realm/realm-java), you can use
Realm Database and Sync to build Android applications written in Java or
Kotlin.

This SDK supports the following platforms:

- Android
- Wear OS
- Android Automotive OS
- Android TV
- Android Things

## Realm Database

The Java SDK provides access to objects stored in a local
instance of Realm Database.

### Define an Object Schema

Define your object schemas with annotated Kotlin or Java classes:

### Query

Query for stored objects using Android-native queries:

### Update

Update objects in Realm Database by updating field values within a
transaction:

### Watch for Updates

Receive object notifications automatically when objects stored in
Realm Database change:

### Live Objects

Live objects keep all instances of an object up-to-date with the data
persisted in the database:

## App Services

MongoDB Realm App Services is a backend for client applications hosted
by MongoDB in the cloud. App Services provides the ability to
synchronize data stored in Realm Database with the cloud. App Services
also provides the ability to access cloud services like user accounts,
function logic, and direct queries to Atlas data.
The Java SDK optionally contains the ability to access
App Services.

### Realm Sync

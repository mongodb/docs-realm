title: Sync Overview
---

Realm Sync automatically synchronizes data between client applications and 
a [Realm App](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/cloud/#std-label-realm-cloud).
When a client  device is online, the SDK asynchronously synchronizes data in a 
background thread between the device and the backend.

When you use Sync in your client application, your implementation must match 
the Sync Mode you select in your backend App configuration. The Sync Mode
options are:

- Partition-Based Sync
- Flexible Sync

You can only use one Sync Mode for your application. The Kotlin
SDK only supports Partition-Based Sync.

## Partition-Based Sync

When you select [Partition-Based Sync](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/sync/data-access-patterns/partitions/#std-label-partition-based-sync)
for your backend App configuration, your client implementation must
include a  partition value. This is the value of the
[partition key](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/sync/data-access-patterns/partitions/#std-label-partition-key)
field you select when you configure Partition-Based Sync. 

The partition value determines which data the client application can access.

You must provide a partition value when you open a synced realm.

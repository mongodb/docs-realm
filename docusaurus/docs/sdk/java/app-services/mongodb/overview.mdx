# Query MongoDB Overview


The following actions enable access to a linked MongoDB Atlas cluster
from an Android application using the {+service-short+} SDK.

Use Cases
---------

There are a variety of reasons you might want to query a MongoDB data source. 
Working with data in your client via Realm Sync is not always practical or 
possible. You might want to query MongoDB when:

- The data set is large or the client device has constraints against loading 
  the entire data set
- You are :ref:`creating or updating custom user data 
  <java-custom-user-data>`
- You are retrieving documents that are not modeled in Realm
- Your app needs to access collections that don't have strict schemas
- A non-Realm service generates collections that you want to access

While not exhaustive, these are some common use cases for querying MongoDB 
directly.

inventory in a chain of plant stores. Consider the following collection
of documents describing various plants for sale in a store:

Delete Documents
----------------

These code snippets demonstrate how to delete documents that
are stored in a MongoDB collection from a mobile application.
Delete operations use a query to specify which documents to delete
and return a :android:`Task <reference/com/google/android/play/core/tasks/Task>`
that resolves to an object that contains the results of the execution
of the operation.

.. _java-mongodb-deleteOne:

Delete a Single Document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can delete a single document from a collection using
:java-sdk:`collection.deleteOne()
<io/realm/mongodb/mongo/MongoCollection.html#deleteOne-Bson->`.

The following snippet deletes one document in a
:ref:`collection of documents that describe plants for sale in a group of stores
<java-mongodb-example-dataset>`. This operation queries for a
document where the ``color`` field has a value of "green" and deletes
the first document that matches the query:

         :language: java
         :copyable: false

Running this snippet produces output resembling the following:

.. code-block:: text
   :copyable: false

   V/EXAMPLE: successfully deleted a document.

.. _java-mongodb-deleteMany:

Delete Multiple Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can delete multiple items from a collection using
:java-sdk:`collection.deleteMany()
<io/realm/mongodb/mongo/MongoCollection.html#deleteMany-Bson->`.

The following snippet deletes all documents in a
:ref:`collection of documents that describe plants for sale in a group of stores
<java-mongodb-example-dataset>`
that match the query that matches documents containing both
a ``sunlight`` field value of "full" and a ``type`` field value of
"annual".

      .. literalinclude:: /examples/generated/java/sync/MongoDBDataAccessTest.codeblock.delete-documents.java
         :language: java
         :copyable: false

Running this snippet produces output resembling the following:

.. code-block:: text
   :copyable: false

   V/EXAMPLE: succcessfully deleted 2 documents.

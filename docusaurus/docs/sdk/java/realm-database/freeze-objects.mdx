Live, thread-confined objects work fine in most cases.
However, some apps -- those based on reactive, event
stream-based architectures, for example -- need to send
immutable copies across threads. In this case,
you can **freeze** objects, collections, and realms.

Freezing creates an immutable view of a specific object,
collection, or realm that still exists on disk and does not
need to be deeply copied when passed around to other
threads. You can freely share a frozen object across threads
without concern for thread issues.

Frozen objects are not live and do not automatically update. They are
effectively snapshots of the object state at the time of freezing. When
you freeze a realm all child objects and collections also become
frozen. You can't modify frozen objects, but you can read the primary
key from a frozen object, query a live realm for the underlying
object, and then update that live object instance.

Frozen objects remain valid for as long as the realm that
spawned them stays open. Avoid closing realms that contain frozen
objects until all threads are done working with those frozen objects.

:::warning Frozen Object Exceptions
When working with frozen objects, an attempt to do any of
the following throws an exception:

- Opening a write transaction on a frozen realm.
- Modifying a frozen object.
- Adding a change listener to a frozen realm, collection, or object.
:::

Once frozen, you cannot unfreeze an object. You
can use `isFrozen()` to check if an object is frozen.
This method is always thread-safe.

To freeze an object, collection, or realm, use the
[`freeze()`](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm-sdks/java/latest/io/realm/RealmObject.html#freeze--)
method:

:::important Frozen Objects and Realm Size
Frozen objects preserve an entire copy of the realm that contains
them at the moment they were frozen. As a result, freezing a large
number of objects can cause a realm to consume more memory and
storage than it might have without frozen objects. If you need to
separately freeze a large number of objects for long periods of time,
consider copying what you need out of the realm instead.

To delete an object from a realm, use either the dynamic or static
versions of [`realmObject.deleteFromRealm()`](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm-sdks/java/latest/io/realm/RealmObject.html#deleteFromRealm())

:::important Do not use objects after delete
Realm Database throws an error if you try to use an object after
it has been deleted.
:::

The following code shows how to delete one object from
a realm with `deleteFromRealm()`:

<Tabs groupId="java-sdk-languages">
    <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
        <CodeBlock language="kotlin">{DeleteKotlin}</CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
        <CodeBlock language="java">{DeleteJava}</CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note

You can only delete objects from a realm within a
[write transaction](/sdk/java/realm-database/write-transactions).

## Delete an Object and its Dependent Objects

Sometimes, you have related objects that you want to delete when
you delete an object. Realm Database does not delete related
objects for you. If you do not delete the objects yourself,
they will remain orphaned in your realm. This may or may not be a problem
in your application.

Currently, the best way to delete dependent objects is to
iterate through the dependencies and delete them before
deleting the parent object.

The following code demonstrates how to delete related objects, then a
parent object, by first deleting all of Ali's turtles,
then deleting Ali:

<Tabs groupId="java-sdk-languages">
    <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
        <CodeBlock language="kotlin">{CascadeDeleteKotlin}</CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
        <CodeBlock language="java">{CascadeDeleteJava}</CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Overview

Realm Database supports a string-based query language to constrain 
searches when retrieving objects. Queries evaluate a predicate for every 
object in the collection being queried. If the predicate resolves 
to `true`, Realm Database includes the object in the results 
collection.

You can use Realm Query Language in most Realm SDKs with your SDK's filter 
or query methods. The Swift SDK is the exception, as it uses the NSPredicate 
query API.

You can also use Realm Query Language to browse for data in
[Realm Studio](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/studio/#std-label-realm-studio).

## Expressions

Filters consist of **expressions** in a predicate. An expression consists of
one of the following:

- The name of a property of the object currently being evaluated.
- An operator and up to two argument expression(s). For example, in the 
  expression `A + B`, the entirety of `A + B` is an expression, but `A`
  and `B` are also argument expressions to the operator `+`. 
- A value, such as a string (`'hello'`) or a number (`5`).

<CodeBlock language="javascript">{Predicate}</CodeBlock>

## Dot Notation

When referring to an object property, you can use **dot notation** to refer
to child properties of that object. You can even refer to the properties of
embedded objects and relationships with dot notation.

For example, consider a query on an object with a `workplace` property that
refers to a Workplace object. The Workplace object has an embedded object
property, `address`. You can chain dot notations to refer to the zipcode
property of that address: 

```javascript

workplace.address.zipcode == 10012
```

## Subqueries

You can iterate through a collection property with another query using the
`SUBQUERY()` predicate function. `SUBQUERY()` has the following signature:

```javascript

SUBQUERY(<collection>, <variableName>, <predicate>)
```

- `collection`: the name of the property to iterate through
- `variableName`: a variable name of the current element to use in the subquery
- `predicate`: a string that contains the subquery predicate. You can use the
  variable name specified by `variableName` to refer to the currently-iterated
  element.

A subquery iterates through the given collection and checks the given
predicate against each object in the collection. The predicate may refer
to the current iterated object with the variable name passed to
`SUBQUERY()`.

A subquery expression resolves to an array. Realm Database only
supports the `@count` [aggregate operator](#aggregate-operators)
on this result. This allows you to count how
many objects in the subquery input collection matched the predicate.

You can use the count of the subquery result as you would any other
number in a valid expression. In particular, you can compare the count
with a number literal (such as `0`) or another property (such as
`quota`).

### Example

The following example shows two filters on a `projects` collection.

- The first returns projects with tasks that have not been completed by a user named Alex.
- The second returns the projects where the number of completed tasks is greater than or equal to the project's quota value.

<CodeBlock language="javascript">{Subquery}</CodeBlock>

### About the Examples On This Page

The examples in this page use a simple data set for a task list app.
The two Realm object types are `Project` and `Task`. A `Task`
has a name, assignee's name, and completed flag. There is also an
arbitrary number for priority -- higher is more important -- and a
count of minutes spent working on it. A `Project` has zero or more
`Tasks` and an optional quota for minimum number of tasks expected
to be completed.

See the schema for these two classes, `Project` and `Task`, below:

<Tabs groupId="sdks">
  <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin SDK">
    <CodeBlock language="kotlin">{KotlinRQLExample}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="swift" label="Swift SDK">
    <CodeBlock language="swift">{SwiftRQLExample}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Operators

There are several types of operators available to query a
Realm collection. With these operators, you can:

- Compare values
- Perform logical evaluations
- Compare string values
- Aggregate collection properties
- Evaluate sets
- Sort and limit results

### Comparison Operators

The most straightforward operation in a search is to compare
values.

:::important Types Must Match

The type on both sides of the operator must be equivalent. For
example, comparing an ObjectId with string will result in a precondition 
failure with a message like:

```
"Expected object of type object id for property 'id' on object of type 
'User', but received: 11223344556677889900aabb (Invalid value)"
```

You can compare any numeric type with any other numeric type,
including decimal, float, and Decimal128.

#### Example

The following example uses the query engine's
comparison operators to:

- Find high priority tasks by comparing the value of the `priority` property value with a threshold number, above which priority can be considered high.
- Find long-running tasks by seeing if the `progressMinutes` property is at or above a certain value.
- Find unassigned tasks by finding tasks where the `assignee` property is equal to `null`.
- Find tasks within a certain time range by finding tasks where the `progressMinutes` property is between two numbers.

### Logical Operators

You can make compound predicates using logical operators.

<table>
   <tr>
      <th>
         Operator
      </th>
      <th>
         Description
      </th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>
         <code>AND</code>, <code>&&</code>
      </td>
      <td>
         Evaluates to <code>true</code> if both left-hand and right-hand expressions are <code>true</code>.
      </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>
         <code>NOT</code>, <code>!</code>
      </td>
      <td>
         Negates the result of the given expression.
      </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>
         <code>OR</code>, <code>||</code>
      </td>
      <td>
         Evaluates to <code>true</code> if either expression returns <code>true</code>.
      </td>
   </tr>
</table>

#### Example

We can use the query language's logical operators to find
all of Ali's completed tasks. That is, we find all tasks
where the `assignee` property value is equal to 'Ali' AND
the `isComplete` property value is <code>true</code>:

<CodeBlock language="javascript">{Logical}</CodeBlock>

### String Operators

You can compare string values using these string operators.
Regex-like wildcards allow more flexibility in search.

#### Case Insensitivity

You can use the following modifiers with the string operators:

- `[c]` for case insensitivity.

```javascript
"name CONTAINS[c] 'a'"
```

<table>
   <tr>
      <th>
         Operator
      </th>
      <th>
         Description
      </th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>
         <code>beginsWith</code>
      </td>
      <td>
         Evaluates to <code>true</code> if the left-hand string expression begins with the right-hand string expression. This is similar to <code>contains</code>, but only matches if the right-hand string expression is found at the beginning of the left-hand string expression.
      </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>
         <code>in</code>
      </td>
      <td>
         Evaluates to <code>true</code> if the left-hand string expression is found anywhere in the right-hand string expression.
      </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>
         <code>contains</code>
      </td>
      <td>
         Evaluates to <code>true</code> if the right-hand string expression is found anywhere in the left-hand string expression.
      </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>
         <code>endsWith</code>
      </td>
      <td>
         Evaluates to <code>true</code> if the left-hand string expression ends with the right-hand string expression. This is similar to <code>contains</code>, but only matches if the left-hand string expression is found at the very end of the right-hand string expression.
      </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>
         <code>like</code>
      </td>
      <td>
       Evaluates to <code>true</code> if the left-hand string expression matches the right-hand string wildcard string expression. A wildcard string expression is a string that uses normal characters with two special wildcard characters, including <code>*</code> (matches zero or more of any character) and <code>?</code> (matches any character). For example, the wildcard string "d?g" matches "dog", "dig", and "dug", but not "ding", "dg", or "a dog".
      </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>
         <code>==</code>, <code>=</code>
      </td>
      <td>
         Evaluates to <code>true</code> if the left-hand string is lexicographically equal to the right-hand string.
      </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>
         <code>!=</code>, <code>&lt;&gt;</code>
      </td>
      <td>
         Evaluates to <code>true</code> if the left-hand string is not lexicographically equal to the right-hand string.
      </td>
   </tr>
</table>

#### Example

We use the query engine's string operators to find:

- Projects with a name starting with the letter 'e'
- Projects with names that contain 'ie'

### Aggregate Operators

You can apply an aggregate operator to a collection property of a Realm
object. Aggregate operators traverse a collection and reduce it to a
single value.

<table>
   <tr>
      <th>
         Operator
      </th>
      <th>
         Description
      </th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>
         <code>@avg</code>
      </td>
      <td>
         Evaluates to the average value of a given numerical property across a collection.
         If any values are <code>null</code>, they are not counted in the result.
      </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>
         <code>@count</code>
      </td>
      <td>
         Evaluates to the number of objects in the given collection. This
         is currently only supported on to-many relationship
         collections and not on lists of primitives. In order to use <code>@count</code>
         on a list of primitives, consider wrapping the primitives in a 
         Realm object.
      </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>
         <code>@max</code>
      </td>
      <td>
         Evaluates to the highest value of a given numerical property across a collection.
         <code>null</code> values are ignored.
      </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>
         <code>@min</code>
      </td>
      <td>
         Evaluates to the lowest value of a given numerical property across a collection.
         <code>null</code> values are ignored.
      </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>
         <code>@sum</code>
      </td>
      <td>
       Evaluates to the sum of a given numerical property across a collection,
       excluding <code>null</code> values.
      </td>
   </tr>
</table>

#### Example

These examples all query for projects containing tasks that meet 
this criteria:

- Projects with average task priority above 5.
- Projects with a task whose priority is less than 5.
- Projects with a task whose priority is greater than 5.
- Projects with more than 5 tasks.
- Projects with long-running tasks.

<CodeBlock language="javascript">{Aggregate}</CodeBlock>

### Collection Operators

A **collection operator** uses specific rules to determine whether
to pass each input collection object to the output
collection by applying a given predicate to every element of
a given list property of
the object.

<table>
   <tr>
      <th>
         Operator
      </th>
      <th>
         Description
      </th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>
         <code>ALL</code>
      </td>
      <td>
         Returns objects where the predicate evaluates to <code>true</code> for all objects in the collection.
      </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>
         <code>ANY</code>, <code>SOME</code>
      </td>
      <td>
         Returns objects where the predicate evaluates to <code>true</code> for any objects in the collection.
      </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>
         <code>NONE</code>
      </td>
      <td>
         Returns objects where the predicate evaluates to false for all objects in the collection.
      </td>
   </tr>
</table>

#### Example

We use the query engine's collection operators to find:

- Projects with no complete tasks.
- Projects with any top priority tasks.

<CodeBlock language="javascript">{Set}</CodeBlock>

### Sort, Distinct, Limit

You can use additional operators in your queries to sort and limit the 
results collection.

<table>
   <tr>
      <th>
         Operator
      </th>
      <th>
         Description
      </th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>
         <code>SORT</code>
      </td>
      <td>
         Specify the name of the property to compare. You can optionally 
         specify ascending (<code>ASC</code>) or descending (<code>DESC</code>) order.
         If you specify multiple SORT fields, the query sorts by the first
         field, and then the second. For example, if you <code>SORT (priority, name)</code>, 
         the query returns sorted by priority, and then by name when priority
         value is the same.
      </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>
         <code>DISTINCT</code>
      </td>
      <td>
         Specify a name of the property to compare. Remove duplicates 
         for that property in the results collection. If you specify multiple 
         DISTINCT fields, the query removes duplicates by the first field, and 
         then the second. For example, if you <code>DISTINCT (name, assignee)</code>, 
         the query only removes duplicates where the values of both properties
         are the same.
      </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>
         <code>LIMIT</code>
      </td>
      <td>
         Limit the results collection to the specified number.
      </td>
   </tr>
</table>

#### Example

We use the query engine's sort, distinct, and limit operators to find: 

- Tasks where the assignee is Ali

  - Sorted by priority in descending order
  - Enforcing uniqueness by name
  - Limiting the results to 5 tasks

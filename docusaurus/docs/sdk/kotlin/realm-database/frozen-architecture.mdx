Unlike the other Realm SDKs, the Kotlin SDK
does not provide live objects and collections that
update simultaneously with underlying data. Instead,
the Kotlin SDK works exclusively with **frozen objects**
that can be passed between threads safely.

## Work with Frozen Objects

Because frozen objects don't automatically update when data changes
in your realm, they work a little differently from the live objects
you may have used in other Realm SDKs.

### Access a Live Version of Frozen Object

In order to modify objects, they must be live. You can convert a frozen
object to a live object in a transaction with [`mutableRealm.findLatest()`](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm-sdks/kotlin/latest/library-base/-realm%20-kotlin%20-multiplatform%20-s-d-k/io.realm/-mutable-realm/find-latest.html).
Live objects are only accessible inside of a write transaction within
a [`write`](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm-sdks/kotlin/latest/library-base/-realm%20-kotlin%20-multiplatform%20-s-d-k/io.realm/-realm/write.html)
or [`writeBlocking`](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm-sdks/kotlin/latest/library-base/-realm%20-kotlin%20-multiplatform%20-s-d-k/io.realm/-realm/write-blocking.html)
closure.

Objects returned from a write closure become frozen objects when the
write transaction completes.

## Thread-safe Realms

The [`Realm`](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm-sdks/kotlin/latest/library-base/-realm%20-kotlin%20-multiplatform%20-s-d-k/io.realm/-realm/index.html)
class is no longer thread-confined, so you can share a single realm
across multiple threads. You no longer need to handle the realm
lifecycle explicitly with calls to
[`Realm.close()`](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm-sdks/kotlin/latest/library-base/-realm%20-kotlin%20-multiplatform%20-s-d-k/io.realm/-realm/close.html)

### Access Changes

To access changes to objects and collections, use
[Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html)
and the [Flow API](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html). Changes
are thread-safe, so you can access them from any context. Notifications
are handled on a dedicated internal notifier thread. Frozen objects now
support change listeners.

:::note The Flows API Requires Kotlinx Coroutines

To use the Flows API in your KMM project, install the
[kotlinx.coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines#multiplatform)
library.
:::

Just like in other Realm SDKs, write transactions implicitly
advance your realm to the most recent version of data stored on disk.

### Lazy Loading

Realm objects are still lazy-loaded by default. This allows
you to query large collections of objects without reading large amounts
of data from disk. This also means that the first access to
a field of an object will always return the most recent data.

<details>
  <summary>x86 Devices are not Compatible with the Kotlin SDK</summary>
  <div>
The Kotlin SDK does not support x86 devices. Since x86 devices are the
default option in Android Studio, you must create an x86_64 or arm64
device in AVD Manager to run applications that use the SDK. You can find
images for compatible devices in AVD Manager. Follow these steps to
create and use a compatible device:

1. Open AVD Manager in Android Studio by selecting `Tools` > `AVD Manager`.

1. Click the `Create Virtual Device` button.

1. Select a phone, such as `Nexus 5`.

1. Click the `Next` button.

1. Navigate to the `x86 Images` tab.

1. Click the `Download` link next to an x86_64 device image, such as
   `S / x86_64 / Android API S (Google Play)`.

1. Click the `Finish` button to close the dialogue when the image
   finishes downloading.

1. Click the `Next` button.

1. Name your device and click the `Finish` button to add it to your list
   of virtual devices.

1. At the top of your Android Studio window, select your compatible
   device in the AVD dropdown.

You can track x86 support in
[this GitHub issue](https://github.com/realm/realm-kotlin/issues/109).

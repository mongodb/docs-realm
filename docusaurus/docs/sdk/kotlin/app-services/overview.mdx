title: App Services Overview
---

You can connect your client apps to the Realm
backend using the SDK. Backend functionality includes:

- [Connect to a Realm App](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/sdk/kotlin/app-services/connect-to-a-realm-app/)
- [Register Users](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/sdk/kotlin/app-services/register-users/)
- [Authenticate Users](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/sdk/kotlin/app-services/authenticate-users/)

## The Realm App Client

To connect to your Realm backend, start with a 
[`App`](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm-sdks/kotlin/latest/library-sync/-realm%20-kotlin%20-multiplatform%20-s-d-k%20-%20-sync/io.realm.mongodb/-app/index.html)
object.
This object provides all other functionality related to 
the backend. Initialize an App with the Realm app ID, which you can 
[find in the Realm UI](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/get-started/find-your-project-or-app-id/#std-label-find-your-app-id).

## Authentication & User Management

One of the most challenging aspects of client development is implementing a 
robust and secure authentication system. With the Realm SDKs,
however, you can use authentication providers with
minimal backend setup and client-side code. With the authentication APIs,
you can implement the following functionality:

- Create new user accounts
- User log in and log out
- Multiple users logged on at the same time on the same device
- Link user accounts from different providers
- Store custom data for a particular user

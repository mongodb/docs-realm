title: Flutter SDK (Beta)
description: Build Flutter applications in Dart with Realm.
---

:::caution Beta Release

This SDK is currently offered as an **beta** release. We encourage you
to try out the feature and [give
feedback](https://feedback.mongodb.com/forums/923521-realm/). However,
be aware that APIs and functionality are subject to change.

The MongoDB Realm Flutter SDK enables client applications written in
[Dart](https://dart.dev/) for the [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
platform to access data stored in local realms.

:::

:::note Local Realm Database Only

The Flutter SDK currently only supports local Realm Database. You cannot
use the Flutter SDK to connect to [MongoDB Realm application
services](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/cloud#std-label-realm-cloud) or use [Realm
Sync](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/sync/learn/overview#std-label-sync).

## Supported Realm Features

The alpha version of the SDK supports the following Realm features:

- Create Realm objects
- Retrieve, query, sort, and filter Realm objects
- Update Realm objects
- Delete Realm objects

### Alpha Limitations

Because this is an alpha version of the SDK, functionality is limited
and there are specific configuration considerations:

- The alpha version of the SDK enables working with a local-only (on
  device) Realm database. Realm Sync functionality is not yet
  implemented.
- The SDK doesn't have built-in functionality to interact with
  [MongoDB Realm application
  services](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/cloud#std-label-realm-cloud).
- The SDK doesn't support Flutter on Linux desktop yet.

## Get Started

To start using the MongoDB Realm Flutter SDK in your Flutter
application, see [Install Realm for Flutter](./install) to add the Flutter SDK dependency and then check out
the [Quick Start](./quick-start).

## Dart Standalone Realm

In addition to using Realm with Flutter, you can also use Realm with
projects that just use Dart, like a CLI application or web server.

The usage for Realm with Dart is the same as the Flutter SDK, except you
must install and set up a separate package.

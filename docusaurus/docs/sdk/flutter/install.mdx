title: Install Realm
---

## Prerequisites

- [Install Flutter in your development
  environment](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install). You must
  use Flutter version 2.8 or later and Dart version 2.15.0 or later.

## Installation

Follow these steps to add the Realm Flutter SDK to your Flutter project.

:::note Use Realm with Only Dart

In addition to using Realm with Flutter, you can also use Realm only
with Dart, like a CLI application or web server.

The usage for Realm with Dart is the same as the Flutter SDK, except you
must install and set up a separate package.

project.](#dart-standalone-installation)

:::

### 1. Create a Flutter Project

Create a Flutter project. Follow the instructions in the [Flutter
documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/test-drive?tab=terminal).

```
flutter create <app_name>
cd <app_name>
```

### 2. Add Realm to the Project

To add the [Realm Flutter SDK](https://pub.dev/packages/realm) to your
project, run the command:

```
flutter pub add realm
```

This downloads the `realm` package and adds it to your project. In your
`pubspec.yaml` file, you should see:

```yaml
dependencies:
  realm: <latest_version>
```

### 3. Import Realm Package

To use the Realm Flutter SDK within your app, import the package into
files where you will use it:

```dart
import 'package:realm/realm.dart';
```

## Dart Standalone Installation

To use Realm with Dart but not Flutter, there is a separate Dart SDK
package with its own installation process. The Dart SDK can be used for
CLI applications or when running Dart in a server environment. The Dart
standalone package `realm_dart` has the same usage as the Flutter
package.

### 1. Create a Dart Project

Create a Dart project.

:::note Using Dart without Flutter

The official Dart docs have helpful getting started material for using
Dart without Flutter for CLI and server use cases.

[See the official documentation.](https://dart.dev/server)

:::

### 2. Add Realm to the Project

To add the [Realm Dart SDK](https://pub.dev/packages/realm_dart) to your
project, run the command:

```
dart pub add realm_dart
```

This downloads the `realm_dart` package and adds it to your project. In
your `pubspec.yaml` file, you should see:

```yaml
dependencies:
  realm_dart: <latest_version>
```

### 3. Install Realm into Application

Install the `realm_dart` package into the application. This downloads
and copies the required native binaries to the app directory.

```
dart run realm_dart install
```

### 4. Import Realm Package

To use the Realm Dart SDK within your app, import the package into files
where you will use it:

```dart
import 'package:realm_dart/realm.dart';
```

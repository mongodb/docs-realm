Building a web app usually requires sending data from a server to the browser.
This comes with lots of overhead, such as authentication, and data validation.
And then the application has to be scalable and secure.
Many libraries and frameworks exist to provide these services.
Selecting the best ones for your project requires deep understanding of the tradeoffs.

MongoDB Realm is a serverless application backend that streamlines solving these common challenges.
Realm provides configurable functions, integrated data access, and security rules.
With Realm, you can focus on building unique features instead of boilerplate backend code.

You can test your application using unit tests or integration tests.
**Unit tests** only assess the logic written in your application's code.
**Integration tests** assess your application logic, database queries and
writes, and calls to your application's backend, if you have one. Unit tests
run on your development machine using the JVM, while integration tests
run on a physical or emulated Android device. You can run integration
tests by communicating with actual instances of Realm Database
or a backend using Android's built-in instrumented tests.

Android uses specific file paths and folder names in Android projects
for unit tests and instrumented tests:

| Test Type          | Path                   |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Unit Tests         | `/app/src/test`        |
| Instrumented Tests | `/app/src/androidTest` |

Because the SDK uses C++ code via Android Native for data
storage, unit testing requires you to entirely mock interactions with
Realm Database. Prefer integration tests for logic that requires
extensive interaction with the database.

## Integration Tests

This section shows how to integration test an application that uses
the Java SDK. It covers the following concepts in the test
environment:

- acquiring an application context
- executing logic on a `Looper` thread
- how to delay test execution while asynchronous method calls complete

Applications that use Sync or App Services also require (not
covered here):

- a separate backend for testing, with separate user accounts
  and data
- a separate Atlas cluster containing test-only data

### Application Context

To initialize the SDK, you'll need to provide an application or activity
[context](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context).
This isn't available by default in Android integration tests. However,
you can use Android's built-in [`ActivityScenario`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/test/core/app/ActivityScenario)
to start an activity in your tests. You can use any activity from
your application, or you can create an empty activity just for testing.
Call `ActivityScenario.launch()` with your activity class as a
parameter to start the simulated activity.

Next, use the `ActivityScenario.onActivity()` method to run a lambda
on the simulated activity's main thread. In this lambda, you should call
the `Realm.init()` function to initialize the SDK with your activity
as a parameter. Additionally, you should save the parameter passed to
your lambda (the newly created instance of your activity) for future
use.

Because the `onActivity()` method runs on a different thread, you
should block your test from executing further until this initial setup
completes.

The following example uses an `ActivityScenario`, an empty testing
activity, and a `CountDownLatch` to demonstrate how to set up an
environment where you can test your app:

<Tabs groupId="java-sdk-languages">
  <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
    <CodeBlock language="kotlin">{InitKotlin}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
    <CodeBlock language="java">{InitJava}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Looper Thread

Realm Database functionality such as live objects and change notifications only
work on [Looper](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Looper) threads.
Threads configured with a `Looper` object pass events over a message
loop coordinated by the `Looper`. Test functions normally don't have
a `Looper` object, and configuring one to work in your tests can be
very error-prone.

Instead, you can use the [`Activity.runOnUiThread()`](<https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#runOnUiThread(java.lang.Runnable)>)
method of your test activity to execute logic on a thread that already
has a `Looper` configured. Combine `Activity.runOnUiThread()` with
a `CountDownLatch` as described in the [delay section](#delay)
to prevent your test from completing
and exiting before your logic executes. Within the `runOnUiThread()`
call, you can interact with the SDK just like you normally would in your
application code:

<Tabs groupId="java-sdk-languages">
  <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
    <CodeBlock language="kotlin">{LooperKotlin}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
    <CodeBlock language="java">{LooperJava}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Delay Test Execution While Async Calls Complete {#delay}

Because the SDK uses asynchronous calls for common operations such as
database queries, authentication, and function calls, tests need a way
to wait for those async calls to complete. Otherwise, your tests will
exit before your asynchronous (or multi-threaded) calls run. This example
uses Java's built-in [`CountDownLatch`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/CountDownLatch.html).
Follow these steps to use a `CountDownLatch` in your own tests:

1. Instantiate a `CountDownLatch` with a count of 1.
   #. After running the async logic your test needs to wait for, call that
   `CountDownLatch` instance's `countDown()` method.
   #. When you need to wait for async logic, add a `try`/`catch` block
   that handles an `InterruptedException`. In that block,
   call that `CountDownLatch` instance's `await()` method.
   #. Pass a timeout interval and unit to `await()`, and wrap
   the call in a `Assert.assertTrue()` assertion. If the logic takes
   too long, the `await()` call times out, returning false and failing
   the test.

The following example demonstrates the use of a `CountDownLatch` to
wait for authentication and opening a realm asynchronously on a separate
thread:

<Tabs groupId="java-sdk-languages">
  <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
    <CodeBlock language="kotlin">{WaitKotlin}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
    <CodeBlock language="java">{WaitJava}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Testing Backend

Applications that use a backend should not connect to the
production backend for testing purposes for the following reasons:

- you should always keep test users and production users separate
  for security and privacy reasons
- tests often require a clean initial state, so there's a good chance
  your tests will include a setup or teardown method that deletes all
  users or large chunks of data

You can use [environments](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/manage-apps/configure/config/environments/#std-label-appconfig-environment)
to manage separate apps for testing and production.

#### Testing Atlas Cluster

Applications that use Sync or [MongoDB queries](/sdk/java/app-services/mongodb/overview)
may read, write, update, or delete data
stored in connected Atlas clusters. For security purposes, you shouldn't
store production data and testing data on the same cluster. Additionally,
tests may require schema changes before those changes are gracefully
handled in your production application. As a result, you should use a
separate Atlas cluster when testing your application.

## Unit Tests

To unit test apps that use the SDK,
you must [mock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object) Realm Database
(and your application backend, if you use one). Use the following
libraries to mock SDK functionality:

- [Robolectric](http://robolectric.org/)
- [PowerMock](https://powermock.github.io/)
- [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/)

To make these libraries available for unit testing in your Android project,
add the following to the `dependencies` block of your application
`build.gradle` file:

```groovy
testImplementation "org.robolectric:robolectric:4.1"
testImplementation "org.mockito:mockito-core:3.3.3"
testImplementation "org.powermock:powermock-module-junit4:2.0.9"
testImplementation "org.powermock:powermock-module-junit4-rule:2.0.9"
testImplementation "org.powermock:powermock-api-mockito2:2.0.9"
testImplementation "org.powermock:powermock-classloading-xstream:2.0.9"
```

:::note Version Compatibility
Mocking the SDK in unit tests requires Robolectric, Mockito, and
Powermock because the SDK uses Android Native C++ method calls to
interact with Realm Database. Because the frameworks required to
override these method calls can be delicate, you should use the
versions listed above to ensure that your mocking is successful. Some
recent version updates (particularly Robolectric version 4.2+) can
break compiliation of unit tests using the SDK.
:::

To configure your unit tests to use Robolectric, PowerMock, and Mockito
with the SDK, add the following annotations to each unit test class that
mocks the SDK:

<Tabs groupId="java-sdk-languages">
  <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
    <CodeBlock language="kotlin">{AnnotationsKotlin}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
    <CodeBlock language="java">{AnnotationsJava}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then, bootstrap Powermock globally in the test class:

<Tabs groupId="java-sdk-languages">
  <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
    <CodeBlock language="kotlin">{PowermockKotlin}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
    <CodeBlock language="java">{PowermockJava}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Next, mock the components of the SDK that might query native C++ code
so we don't hit the limitations of the test environment:

<Tabs groupId="java-sdk-languages">
  <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
    <CodeBlock language="kotlin">{MockRealmComponentsKotlin}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
    <CodeBlock language="java">{MockRealmComponentsJava}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once you've completed the setup required for mocking, you can start
mocking components and wiring up behavior for your tests. You can also
configure PowerMockito to return specific objects when new objects of
a type are instantiated, so even code that references the default
realm in your application won't break your tests:

<Tabs groupId="java-sdk-languages">
  <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
    <CodeBlock language="kotlin">{MockRealmKotlin}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
    <CodeBlock language="java">{MockRealmJava}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

After mocking a realm, you'll have to configure data for your test
cases. See the full example below for some examples of how you can
provide testing data in unit tests.

#### Full Example

The following example shows a full JUnit `test`
example mocking Realm Database in unit tests. This example tests
an activity that performs some basic Realm Database operations.
The tests use mocking to simulate those operations when that activity is
started during a unit test:

  <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
    <CodeBlock language="kotlin">{UnitTestActivityKotlin}</CodeBlock>
    <CodeBlock language="kotlin">{TestKotlin}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
    <CodeBlock language="java">{UnitTestActivityJava}</CodeBlock>
    <CodeBlock language="kotlin">{TestKotlin}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

If you need to sync data when your app isn't running, you can sync realms
in a background process.

## Prerequisites

To get started with background synchronization, you need to add the
following dependencies to your Android application:

- [`androidx.work:work-runtime`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/package-summary),
  to enqueue jobs
- [`androidx.concurrent:concurrent-futures`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/concurrent/futures/package-summary),
  to return job results from a background worker

## Example

Background sync requires two things:

- synchronization logic
- a scheduled job that periodically performs that logic

### Synchronization Logic

First, write the custom logic that synchronizes your realm. Treat this
logic as a standalone connection to your backend. As a result, you'll
need to:

- initialize the Realm SDK
- authenticate a user to open the realm

You can use a user's cached credentials if the user recently used the app.

Open the realm, then use [`SyncSession.downloadAllServerChanges()`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/sdk/java/api/io/realm/mongodb/sync/SyncSession/#downloadallserverchanges)
and [`SyncSession.uploadAllLocalChanges()`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/sdk/java/api/io/realm/mongodb/sync/SyncSession/#uploadalllocalchanges)
to synchronize the realm fully with the backend.

You can execute this logic as a background process using a subclass of
[`ListenableWorker`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/ListenableWorker.html).
Put your synchronization logic in the `startWork()` method of your worker:

    <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
        <CodeBlock language="kotlin">{WorkerKotlin}</CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
        <CodeBlock language="java">{WorkerJava}</CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Worker

To create a worker that periodically performs background sync:

1. Create a set of constraints that specify the conditions required for
   your worker.

1. Specify how frequently your worker should execute.

1. Enqueue your worker with the Android OS. Assign it a unique identifier
   so that you can update the job in the future.

You can create the background sync job inside an Application subclass in
your app to guarantee that the logic only executes once every time your
application runs.

Since synchronizing a realm uses data, you should consider only downloading
changes in the background when the device is *not*:

- low on battery
- using a metered data source

Use [`Constraints`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/Constraints.Builder)
to describe the environment where your background sync runs.

Your repeat interval depends on how frequently data updates in the
realm and how often users open your application. If the realm frequently
updates throughout the day, consider setting a repeat interval of 1-3 hours.
If the realm only updates a small number of times each day, it's best to
set a higher repeat interval and only background sync once or twice a day.

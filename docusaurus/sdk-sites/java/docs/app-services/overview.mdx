# App Services Overview

You can connect your client apps to the Realm
backend using the SDK. Backend functionality includes:

- [Connect to a Realm App](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/sdk/java/app-services/connect-to-a-realm-app/)
- [Register Users](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/sdk/java/app-services/register-users/)
- [Authenticate Users](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/sdk/java/app-services/authenticate-users/)
- [Functions](/sdk/java/app-services/functions)
- [MongoDB Data Access](/sdk/java/app-services/mongodb/overview)

## The Realm App Client

To connect to your Realm backend, start with an `App` object.
This object provides all other functionality related to
the backend. Initialize an App with the Realm app ID, which you can
[find in the Realm UI](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/get-started/find-your-project-or-app-id/#std-label-find-your-app-id).

## Authentication & User Management

One of the most challenging aspects of client development is implementing a
robust and secure authentication system. With the Realm SDKs,
however, you can use authentication providers with
minimal backend setup and client-side code. With the authentication APIs,
you can implement the following functionality:

- Create new user accounts
- User log in and log out
- Multiple users logged on at the same time on the same device
- Link user accounts from different providers
- Store custom data for a particular user

[Authenticate Users](/sdk/java/app-services/users/authenticate-users).

## Functions

[Realm functions](/sdk/java/app-services/functions) enable you to define and
execute server-side logic for your application. You can call these
functions from your client applications via the SDK. These server-side
functions can run under the context of the authenticated user, and thus
honor the rules, roles, and permissions you have assigned to your
collections.

By using Realm functions, you provide a secure way for a variety of client
applications to share complex functionality without having to reproduce that
logic client-side.

## Access MongoDB

The SDK includes APIs for accessing a MongoDB Atlas instance directly.
With these APIs, you can perform all of the standard CRUD operations
from your client. For security, you configure server-side data access
rules to dynamically determine read & write permissions for every object
accessed.

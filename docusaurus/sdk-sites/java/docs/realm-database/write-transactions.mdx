## Overview

Realm Database uses a highly efficient storage engine
to persist objects. You can **create** objects in a realm,
**update** objects in a realm, and eventually **delete**
objects from a realm. Because these operations modify the
state of the realm, we call them writes.

Realm handles writes in terms of **transactions**. A
transaction is a list of read and write operations that
Realm treats as a single indivisible operation. In other
words, a transaction is _all or nothing_: either all of the
operations in the transaction succeed or none of the
operations in the transaction take effect.

:::note

All writes must happen in a transaction.
:::

A realm allows only one open write transaction at a time. Realm
blocks other writes on other threads until the open
transaction is complete. Consequently, there is no race
condition when reading values from the realm within a
transaction.

When you are done with your transaction, Realm either
**commits** it or **cancels** it:

- When Realm **commits** a transaction, it writes
  all changes to disk. For synced realms, the SDK queues the change
  for synchronization with the backend.
- When Realm **cancels** a write transaction or an operation in
  the transaction causes an error, all changes are discarded
  (or "rolled back").

## Run a Transaction

Realm represents each transaction as a callback function
that contains zero or more read and write operations. To run
a transaction, define a transaction callback and pass it to
the realm's `write` method. Within this callback, you are
free to create, read, update, and delete on the realm. If
the code in the callback throws an exception when Realm runs
it, Realm cancels the transaction. Otherwise, Realm commits
the transaction immediately after the callback.

### Example

The following code shows how to run a transaction with
[`write()`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm-sdks/kotlin/latest/library-base/-realm%20-kotlin%20-multiplatform%20-s-d-k/io.realm/-realm/write.html)
or [`writeBlocking()`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm-sdks/kotlin/latest/library-base/-realm%20-kotlin%20-multiplatform%20-s-d-k/io.realm/-realm/write-blocking.html).
If the code in the callback throws an exception, Realm
cancels the transaction. Otherwise, Realm commits the
transaction.

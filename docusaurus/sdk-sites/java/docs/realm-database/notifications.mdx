## Register a Realm Change Listener

You can register a notification handler on an entire realm.
The SDK calls the notification handler whenever any write
transaction involving that realm is committed. The
handler receives no information about the change.

This is useful when you want to know that there has been a
change but do not care to know specifically what changed.
For example, proof of concept apps often use this
notification type and simply refresh the entire UI when
anything changes. As the app becomes more sophisticated and
performance-sensitive, the app developers shift to more
granular notifications.

### Example

Suppose you are writing a real-time collaborative app. To
give the sense that your app is buzzing with collaborative
activity, you want to have an indicator that lights up when
any change is made. In that case, a realm notification
handler would be a great way to drive the code that controls
the indicator. The following code shows how to observe a realm
for changes with with [`realm.addChangeListener()`](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm-sdks/java/latest/io/realm/RealmResults.html#addChangeListener-io.realm.OrderedRealmCollectionChangeListener-):

<Tabs groupId="java-sdk-languages">
    <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
        <CodeBlock language="kotlin">{RealmKotlin}</CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
        <CodeBlock language="java">{RealmJava}</CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::important Automatic Refresh
All threads that contain a `Looper` automatically refresh
`RealmObject` and `RealmResult` instances when new changes are
written to the realm. As a result, it isn't necessary to fetch
those objects again when reacting to a `RealmChangeListener`, since
those objects are already updated and ready to be redrawn to the
screen.
:::

## Register a Collection Change Listener

You can register a notification handler on a specific
collection within a realm. The handler receives a
description of changes since the last notification.
Specifically, this description consists of three lists of
indices:

- The indices of the objects that were deleted.
- The indices of the objects that were inserted.
- The indices of the objects that were modified.

Stop notification delivery by calling the `removeChangeListener()` or
`removeAllChangeListeners()` methods. Notifications also stop if:

- the object on which the listener is registered gets garbage collected.
- the realm instance closes.

Keep a strong reference to the object you’re listening to
for as long as you need the notifications.

:::important Order Matters
In collection notification handlers, always apply changes
in the following order: deletions, insertions, then
modifications. Handling insertions before deletions may
result in unexpected behavior.
:::

Realm Database emits an initial notification after retrieving the
collection. After that, Realm Database delivers collection
notifications asynchronously whenever a write transaction
adds, changes, or removes objects in the collection.

Unlike realm notifications, collection notifications contain
detailed information about the change. This enables
sophisticated and selective reactions to changes. Collection
notifications provide all the information needed to manage a
list or other view that represents the collection in the UI.

### Example

The following code shows how to observe a collection for
changes with [`collection.addChangeListener()`](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm-sdks/java/latest/io/realm/Realm.html#addChangeListener-io.realm.RealmChangeListener-):

<Tabs groupId="java-sdk-languages">
    <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
        <CodeBlock language="kotlin">{CollectionKotlin}</CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
        <CodeBlock language="java">{CollectionJava}</CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Register an Object Change Listener

You can register a notification handler on a specific object
within a realm. Realm Database notifies your handler:

- When the object is deleted.
- When any of the object's properties change.

The handler receives information about what fields changed
and whether the object was deleted.

Stop notification delivery by calling the `removeChangeListener()` or
`removeAllChangeListeners()` methods. Notifications also stop if:

- the object on which the listener is registered gets garbage collected.
- the realm instance closes.

Keep a strong reference of the object you’re listening to
for as long as you need the notifications.

### Example

The following code shows how create a new instance of a class
in a realm and observe that instance for changes with
[`object.addChangeListener()`](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm-sdks/java/latest/io/realm/RealmObject.html#addChangeListener-E-io.realm.RealmObjectChangeListener-):

<Tabs groupId="java-sdk-languages">
    <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
        <CodeBlock language="kotlin">{ObjectKotlin}</CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
        <CodeBlock language="java">{ObjectJava}</CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Unregister a Change Listener

You can unregister a change listener by passing your change listener to
[`realm.removeChangeListener()`](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm-sdks/java/latest/io/realm/Realm.html#removeChangeListener-io.realm.RealmChangeListener-).
You can unregister all change listeners currently subscribed to changes
in a realm or any of its linked objects or collections with
[`realm.removeAllChangeListeners()`](https://docs.mongodb.com/realm-sdks/java/latest/io/realm/Realm.html#removeAllChangeListeners--).

## Notifications in System Apps on Custom ROMs

The SDK uses named pipes in order to support notifications and
access to the realm file from multiple processes. While this is
allowed by default for normal user apps, it is disallowed for system
apps.

You can define a system apps by setting `android:sharedUserId="android.uid.system"`
in the Android manifest. When working with a system app, you may see a
security violation in Logcat that looks something like this:

```
05-24 14:08:08.984  6921  6921 W .realmsystemapp: type=1400 audit(0.0:99): avc: denied { write } for name="realm.testapp.com.realmsystemapp-Bfqpnjj4mUvxWtfMcOXBCA==" dev="vdc" ino=14660 scontext=u:r:system_app:s0 tcontext=u:object_r:apk_data_file:s0 tclass=dir permissive=0
05-24 14:08:08.984  6921  6921 W .realmsystemapp: type=1400 audit(0.0:100): avc: denied { write } for name="realm.testapp.com.realmsystemapp-Bfqpnjj4mUvxWtfMcOXBCA==" dev="vdc" ino=14660 scontext=u:r:system_app:s0 tcontext=u:object_r:apk_data_file:s0 tclass=dir permissive=0
```

In order to fix this you need to adjust the SELinux security rules in
the ROM. This can be done by using the tool `audit2allow`, which ships
as part of AOSP:

1. Pull the current policy from the device:

   ```sh
   adb pull /sys/fs/selinux/policy
   ```

1. Copy the SELinux error inside a text file called `input.txt`.

1. Run the `audit2allow` tool:

   ```sh
   audit2allow -p policy -i input.txt
   ```

1. The tool should output a rule you can add to your existing policy
   to enable the use of Realm Database.

An example of such a policy is provided below:

```
# Allow system_app to create named pipes required by Realm
# Credit: https://github.com/mikalackis/platform_vendor_ariel/blob/master_oreo/sepolicy/system_app.te
allow system_app fuse:fifo_file create;
allow system_app system_app_data_file:fifo_file create;
allow system_app system_app_data_file:fifo_file { read write };
allow system_app system_app_data_file:fifo_file open;
```

:::info audit2allow
`audit2allow` is produced when compiling AOSP/ROM and only runs on
Linux. You can read more about it [here](https://source.android.com/security/selinux/validate#using_audit2allow).
:::

:::note Changes in Android Oreo and Above
Since Android Oreo, Google changed the way it configures SELinux.
The default security policies are now much more modularized.
Read more about that [here](https://source.android.com/security/selinux/images/SELinux_Treble.pdf).

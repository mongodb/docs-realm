# Realm Overview

## The Realm Lifecycle

Every realm instance consumes a significant amount of resources.
Opening and closing a realm are both expensive operations, but
keeping a realm open also incurs significant resource overhead. To
maximize the performance of your application, you should minimize the
number of open realms at any given time and limit the number of
open and close operations used.

However, opening a realm is not always consistently expensive.
If the realm is already open within the same process or thread,
opening an additional instance requires fewer resources:

- If the realm is not open within the same process, opening the
  realm is expensive.

- If the realm is already open on a different thread within the
  same process, opening the realm is less expensive, but still
  nontrivial.

- If the realm is already open on the same thread within the same
  process, opening the realm requires minimal additional resources.

When you open a realm for the first time, Realm Database
performs the memory-mapping and schema validation required to read and
write data to the realm. Additional instances of that
realm on the same thread use the same underlying resources.
Instances of that realm on separate threads use some of the same
underlying resources.

When all connections to a realm are closed in
a thread, Realm Database frees the thread resources used to
connect to that realm. When all connections to a realm are
closed in a process, Realm Database frees all resources used to
connect to that realm.

As a best practice, we recommend tying the realm instance
lifecycle to the lifecycles of the views that observe the realm. For
instance, consider a `RecyclerView` that displays `RealmResults`
data via a `Fragment`. You could:

- Open a single realm that contains the data for that view
  in the `Fragment.onCreateView()` lifecycle method.
- Close that same realm in the `Fragment.onDestroyView()`
  lifecycle method.

:::note
If your realm is especially large, fetching a realm instance
in `Fragment.onCreateView()` may briefly block rendering. If
opening your realm in `onCreateView()` causes performance
issues, consider managing the realm from `Fragment.onStart()`
and `Fragment.onStop()` instead.
:::

If multiple `Fragment` instances require access to the same dataset,
you could manage a single realm in the enclosing `Activity`:

- Open the realm in the `Activity.onCreate()` lifecycle method.
- Close the realm in the `Activity.onDestroy()` lifecycle method.

## Comparison with Other Databases

The Realm Database data model is similar to both relational and document
databases but has distinct differences from both. To underscore these
differences, it's helpful to highlight what a realm **is not**:

A realm is not a single, application-wide database.
Unlike other applications, which store all of their data in a single
database, apps often split data across multiple realms to
organize data more efficiently and to enforce access controls.

A realm is not a table.
Tables typically only store one kind of information, such as street
addresses or items in a store inventory, whereas a realm can contain
any number of object types.

A realm is not a collection of schemaless documents.
Application objects are similar to documents, but every object in a
realm conforms to a defined schema for its object type. An object
cannot contain a field that is not described by its schema.

## Realm Schema

A **Realm Schema** is a list of valid object schemas that each define an
object type that Realm Database may persist. All objects in a realm must
conform to the schema.

By default, the SDK automatically adds all classes in your project
that derive from `RealmObject` to the realm schema. You can override
this behavior with modules.

Client applications provide a schema when they open a
realm. If a realm already contains data, then Realm Database
validates each existing object to ensure that an object schema was
provided for its type and that it meets all of the constraints specified
in the schema.

## Find Your Realm File

Realm Database stores a binary encoded version of every object
and type in a realm in a single `.realm` file.

The filesystem used by Android emulators is not directly accessible
from Realm Studio on the same development machine. You must download the
file from the emulator before you can access it.

1. First, find the path of the file on the emulator:

   ```java
   // Run this on the device to find the path on the emulator
   Realm realm = Realm.getDefaultInstance();
   Log.i("Realm", realm.getPath());
   ```

1. Then, download the file using ADB. You can do this while the app is running.

   ```sh
   adb pull <path>
   ```

You can also upload the modified file again using ADB, but only when the
app isn't running. Uploading a modified file while the app is running
can corrupt the file.

```sh
adb push <file> <path>
```

:::note Auxiliary Realm Files
Realm Database creates additional files for each realm.
To learn more about these files, see
[Realm Database Overview](/sdk/java/realm-database/overview).

## Realm File Size

Realm Database usually takes up less space on disk than an
equivalent SQLite database. However, in order to give you a consistent
view of your data, the SDK operates on multiple versions of a
realm. If many versions of a realm are open simultaneously,
the realm file can require additional space on disk.

These versions take up an amount of space dependent on the amount of
changes in each transaction. Many small transactions have the same
overhead as a small number of large transactions.

Unexpected file size growth usually happens for one of three reasons:

- _You open a realm on a background thread and forget to close it
  again._ As a result, Realm Database retains a reference to the
  older version of data on the background thread. Because
  the SDK automatically updates realms to the most
  recent version on threads with loopers, the UI thread and other
  Looper threads do not have this problem.

- _You hold references to too many versions of frozen objects._
  Frozen objects preserve the version of a realm that existed when
  the object was first frozen. If you need to freeze a large number of
  objects, consider using [`realm.copyFromRealm()`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm-sdks/java/latest/io/realm/Realm.html#copyFromRealm-E-)
  instead to only preserve the data you need.

- _You read some data from a realm. Then, you block the thread with
  a long-running operation. Meanwhile, you write many times to the
  realm on other threads._ This causes the SDK to
  create many intermediate versions. You can avoid this by:

  - batching the writes

  - avoiding leaving the realm open while otherwise blocking the
    background thread.

### Compact a Realm

You can remove unused space by **compacting** the realm file:

- **Manually**: call [`compactRealm()`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm-sdks/java/latest/io/realm/Realm.html#compactRealm-io.realm.RealmConfiguration-).

- **Automatically**: specify the [`compactOnLaunch()`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm-sdks/java/latest/io/realm/RealmConfiguration.Builder.html#compactOnLaunch-io.realm.CompactOnLaunchCallback-)
  builder option when opening the first connection to a realm in your
  Android application.

:::tip Implement Compacting in Your Production Application
Every production application should implement compacting to
periodically reduce the realm file size.
:::

### Limit the Maximum Number of Active Versions

You can set [`maxNumberOfActiveVersions()`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm-sdks/java/latest/io/realm/RealmConfiguration.Builder.html#maxNumberOfActiveVersions-long-)
when building your `RealmConfiguration` to throw an
`IllegalStateException` if your application opens more versions of
a realm than the permitted number. Versions are created when
executing a write transaction.

Realm Database automatically removes older versions of data once
they are no longer used by your application. However,
Realm Database does not free the space used by older versions of
data. Instead, that space is used for new writes to the realm.

## Backup and Restore Realms

Realm Database persists realms to disk using files on your
Android device. To back up a realm, find your realm file
and copy it to a safe location. You should close
all instances of the realm before copying it.

Alternatively, you can also use [`realm.writeCopyTo()`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm-sdks/java/latest/io/realm/Realm.html#writeCopyTo-java.io.File-)
to write a compacted version of a realm to a destination file.

## Multi-process

Local realms function normally across processes, so you can read, write,
and receive notifications from multiple APKs.

:::warning Encrypted and Synced Realms are Not Multi-Process
You cannot access encrypted or synced realms simultaneously from
different processes.

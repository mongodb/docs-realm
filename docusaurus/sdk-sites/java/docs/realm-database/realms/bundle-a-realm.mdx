The SDK supports **bundling** realm files. When you bundle
a realm file, you include a database and all of its data in your
application download.

This allows users to start applications for the first time with a set of
initial data. For synced realms, bundling can avoid a lengthy
initial download the first time a user opens your application. Instead,
users must only download the synced changes that occurred since you
generated the bundled file.

:::caution Synced Realm Bundling and Client Maximum Offline Time

If your application has enabled advanced backend compaction by configuring a
[client maximum offline time](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/sync/configure/optimize-sync-atlas-usage/#std-label-client-maximum-offline-time),
users could experience a client reset the first time they open the
bundled realm file. This can happen if:

- the bundled realm file was generated more than
  **client maximum offline time** days before the user syncs the
  realm for the first time.

Users experiencing a client reset download the full state of the
realm from the application backend. This negates the
advantages of bundling a realm file. To prevent client resets and
preserve the advantages of realm file bundling:

- Avoid using a client maximum offline time in applications that
  bundle a synchronized realm.

- If your application does use a client maximum offline time, ensure
  that your application download always includes a recently synced
  realm file. Generate a new file each application version,
  and ensure that no version ever stays current for more than
  **client maximum offline time** number of days.

## Overview

To create and bundle a realm file with your application:

1. Create a realm file that
   contains the data you'd like to bundle.

1. Bundle the realm file in the `/<app name>/src/main/assets`
   folder of your production application.

1. In your production application,
   open the realm from the bundled asset file. For synced
   realms, you must supply the partition key.

## Create a Realm File for Bundling

1. Build a temporary realm app that shares the data model of your
   application.

1. Open a realm and add the data you wish to bundle. If using a
   synchronized realm, allow time for the realm to fully sync.

1. Use [`realm.writeCopyTo()`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm-sdks/java/latest/io/realm/Realm.html#writeCopyTo-java.io.File-)
   method to copy the realm to a new file:

   <Tabs groupId="java-sdk-languages">
     <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
       <CodeBlock language="kotlin">{CopyKotlin}</CodeBlock>
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
       <CodeBlock language="java">{CopyJava}</CodeBlock>
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

   `writeCopyTo()` automatically compacts your realm to the smallest
   possible size before copying.

   :::note Differences Between Synced Realms and Local-only Realms

   The above example uses a `SyncConfiguration` to configure a synchronized
   realm. To create a copy of a local realm, configure your realm
   with `RealmConfiguration` instead.

## Bundle a Realm File in Your Production Application

Now that you have a copy of the realm that contains the initial data,
bundle it with your production application.

1. Search your application logs to find the location of the realm file
   copy you just created.

1. Using the "Device File Explorer" widget in the bottom right of your
   Android Studio window, navigate to the file.

1. Right click on the file and select "Save As". Navigate to the
   `/<app name>/src/main/assets` folder of your production application.
   Save a copy of the realm file there.

:::note Asset Folders
If your application does not already contain an asset folder, you can
create one by right clicking on your top-level application
folder (`<app name>`) in Android Studio and selecting
`New` > `Folder` > `Assets Folder` in the menu.

## Open a Realm from a Bundled Realm File

Now that you have a copy of the realm included with your production
application, you need to add code to use it. Use [`builder.assetFile()`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm-sdks/java/latest/io/realm/RealmConfiguration.Builder.html#assetFile-java.lang.String-)
method when configuring your realm to open the realm
from the bundled file:

<Tabs groupId="java-sdk-languages">
  <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
    <CodeBlock language="kotlin">{UseKotlin}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
    <CodeBlock language="java">{UseJava}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note Differences Between Synced Realms and Local-only Realms

The above example uses a `SyncConfiguration` to configure a synchronized
realm. To create a copy of a local realm, configure your realm
with `RealmConfiguration` instead.

title: Delete Multiple Objects

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";
import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import DeleteCollKotlin from "!!raw-loader!@site/docs/generated/java/sync/WritesTest.codeblock.delete-a-collection.kt";
import DeleteCollJava from "!!raw-loader!@site/docs/generated/java/sync/WritesTest.codeblock.delete-a-collection.java";

To delete multiple objects from a realm:

1. Query for the objects you would like to delete. You'll need a subclass
   of `RealmCollection`, such as a `RealmList`, containing the objects.

1. Use the [`deleteAllFromRealm()`](<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm-sdks/java/latest/io/realm/RealmCollection.html#deleteAllFromRealm()>)
   method of the `RealmCollection` subclass to delete the objects.

The following code demonstrates how to delete a
collection of objects from a realm with `deleteAllFromRealm()`:

<Tabs groupId="java-sdk-languages">
  <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
    <CodeBlock language="kotlin">{DeleteCollKotlin}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
    <CodeBlock language="java">{DeleteCollJava}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note

You can only delete objects from a realm within a
[write transaction](/sdk/java/realm-database/write-transactions).

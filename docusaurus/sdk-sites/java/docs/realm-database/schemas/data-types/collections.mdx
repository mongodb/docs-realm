A Realm collection is an
object that contains zero or more instances of a Realm object. Unlike
realms, Realm collections are homogeneous: all objects in a collection
are of the same type.

You can filter and sort any collection using Realm Database's
query engine. Collections are live, so they always reflect the
current state of the realm. You can subscribe to notifications on
changes to any collection.

Realm Database has two kinds of collections: **lists** and **results**.

## Lists

Collections can contain lists of data other than Realm objects.
You can model these collections with the type `RealmList<T>`,
where `T` can be the following types:

- `String`
- `Integer`
- `UUID`
- `ObjectId`
- `Boolean`
- `Float`
- `Double`
- `Short`
- `Long`
- `Byte`
- `byte[]`
- `Date`

:::note Nullability
Unlike lists of Realm objects, these lists can contain
null values. If null values shouldn't be allowed, use the
[`@Required`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/sdk/java/api/io/realm/annotations/Required/) annotation.
:::

## List Collections

A **list collection** represents a to-many
relationship between two Realm objects.
Lists are mutable: within a write transaction, you
can add and remove elements on a list. Lists are not
associated with a query.

## Results Collections

A **results collection** represents the lazily-evaluated
results of a query operation. Results are immutable: you
cannot add or remove elements on the results collection.
Results have an associated query that determines their
contents.

The [`RealmResults`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/sdk/java/api/io/realm/RealmResults/)
class inherits from [`AbstractList`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/AbstractList.html)
and behaves similarly:

- `RealmResults` are ordered.

- You can access individual objects with an index lookup.

- If a query has no matches, the returned `RealmResults` object will be
  a list of length 0 (not a `null` object reference).

You can only modify or delete objects in a `RealmResults` set
in a write transaction.

## Iteration

Because Realm collections are live, objects may move as you
iterate over a collection. You can use
snapshots to iterate over collections safely.

## Collections are Live

Like live objects, Realm collections are usually **live**:

- Live results collections always reflect the current results of the
  associated query.
- Live lists always reflect the current state of the relationship on the
  realm instance.

There are three cases when a collection is **not** live:

- The collection is unmanaged, e.g. a List property of a Realm object
  that has not been added to a realm yet or that has been copied from a
  realm.
- The collection is frozen.
- The collection is part of a snapshot.

Combined with collection notifications, live collections enable clean,
reactive code. For example, suppose your view displays the
results of a query. You can keep a reference to the results
collection in your view class, then read the results
collection as needed without having to refresh it or
validate that it is up-to-date.

:::important Indexes may change
Since results update themselves automatically, do not
store the positional index of an object in the collection
or the count of objects in a collection. The stored index
or count value could be outdated by the time you use it.
:::

## Results are Lazily Evaluated

Realm Database only runs a query when you actually request the
results of that query, e.g. by accessing elements of the
results collection. This lazy evaluation enables you to
write elegant, highly performant code for handling large
data sets and complex queries. This also means that if you don't access
any results from a query, the SDK never fetches the underlying data.

## Limiting Query Results

As a result of lazy evaluation, you do not need any special
mechanism to limit query results with Realm Database. For example, if
your query matches thousands of objects, but you only want
to load the first ten, simply access only the first ten
elements of the results collection.

## Pagination

Thanks to lazy evaluation, the common task of pagination
becomes quite simple. For example, suppose you have a
results collection associated with a query that matches
thousands of objects in your realm. You display one hundred
objects per page. To advance to any page, simply access the
elements of the results collection starting at the index
that corresponds to the target page.

## List vs. Results

When you need a collection, you can use the following rule
of thumb to determine whether a list or a results collection
is appropriate:

- When you define a schema, use lists to define to-many relationships
  except implicit inverse relationships.
- Use results everywhere else.

To understand these different use cases, consider whether
you should be able to add or remove objects directly. Lists
allow you to add and remove objects directly, because you
control the relationships. Results collections do not allow
you to add or remove objects directly, because their contents
are determined by a query.

:::note Example
Consider a Realm type called Person with a field called
`emails`: a collection of strings representing
email addresses. You control this data. Your application
needs to add and remove email addresses from your Person
instances. Therefore, use a **list** to define the field
type of `emails`.

On the other hand, when you query the realm for all
Persons over the age of 25, it would not make sense for
you to add or remove Persons directly to the resulting
collection. The contents of that collection only change
when the query matches a different set of Persons.
Therefore, Realm Database gives you a **results** collection.

:::info Inverse one-to-many relationship property exception
Since Realm Database automatically determines the contents of
implicit inverse relationship collections, you may not add
or remove objects from such a collection directly.
Therefore, the type of such a one-to-many relationship
property is actually a results collection, not a list.
:::

## Adapters

:::important Adapters Require Managed Objects

The Realm Database adapters only accept _managed_
Realm object instances tied to an instance of a realm.
To display non-managed objects, use the general-use Android
`RecyclerView.Adapter` for recycler views or `ArrayAdapter` for
list views.
:::

Android applications usually display collection data in the UI using the
built-in [`RecyclerView`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/recyclerview/widget/RecyclerView.html)
or [`ListView`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ListView)
components. Realm offers **adapters** to help display data
contained in collections of
Realm objects that implement the `OrderedRealmCollections`
interface, including [`RealmResults`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/sdk/java/api/io/realm/RealmResults/)
and [`RealmList`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/sdk/java/api/io/realm/RealmList/).
When you use these adapters, UI components automatically update to
reflect changes to data in your realm.

### Install

<details>
  <summary>Adapters Hosted on JCenter</summary>
  <div>

The Realm adapters are currently hosted on the
[JCenter](https://mvnrepository.com/repos/jcenter)
artifact repository. If you have not already registered `jcenter` as a
repository for your Android application, you can add it to your project
with the following lines in your project level `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
}

allprojects {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
}
```

JFrog has committed to host JCenter as a read-only repository
[indefinitely](https://blog.gradle.org/jcenter-shutdown). For now, you
have two options for using the Realm adapters in your Android apps:

- Access the adapters on JCenter and ignore the "deprecated" warning in
  Android studio.

- Copy the `RealmBaseAdapter.java` and `RealmRecyclerViewAdapter.java`
  classes from the [realm/realm-android-adapters](https://github.com/realm/realm-android-adapters/tree/master/adapters/src/main/java/io/realm)
  GitHub repository. The interfaces used by these adapters are unlikely
  to change in the Java SDK.

<!-- This comment lets the formatter know the bulleted list ends -->

  </div>
</details>

To use the adapters, add the following dependencies to your application
level `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
   implementation 'io.realm:android-adapters:4.0.0'
   implementation 'androidx.recyclerview:recyclerview:1.1.0'
}
```

### Example Models

The adapter examples all use the following data models for a
Realm object named `Item`. This class contains a single
piece of string data called "name" and an identifier number called "id":

<Tabs groupId="java-sdk-languages">
  <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
    <CodeBlock language="kotlin">{ItemKotlin}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
    <CodeBlock language="java">{ItemJava}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Display Collections in a ListView

You can display Realm objects in a `ListView` by extending `RealmBaseAdapter`.
The adapter uses the `ListAdapter` interface, so implementation works
like any implementation of `ListAdapter` -- with support
for automatically-updating Realm objects.

The following example demonstrates how to use a subclass of
`RealmBaseAdapter` to display `Item` objects in a `ListView`:

<Tabs groupId="java-sdk-languages">
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
<CodeBlock language="kotlin">{ExampleListAdapterKotlin}</CodeBlock>

The following code instantiates a `ListView` and attaches an
`ExampleListAdapter` to display list data in an activity:

<CodeBlock language="kotlin">{ListAdapterUsageKotlin}</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">
<CodeBlock language="java">{ExampleListAdapterJava}</CodeBlock>

The following code instantiates a `ListView` and attaches an
`ExampleListAdapter` to display list data in an activity:

<CodeBlock language="java">{ListAdapterUsageJava}</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Display Collections in a RecyclerView

You can display Realm objects in a `RecyclerView` by extending `RealmRecyclerViewAdapter`.
The adapter extends `RecyclerView.Adapter`, so implementation works
like any `RecyclerView` adapter -- with support
for automatically-updating Realm objects.

The following example demonstrates how to use a subclass of
`RealmRecyclerViewAdapter` to display
`Item` objects in a `RecyclerView`:

<Tabs groupId="java-sdk-languages">
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
<CodeBlock language="kotlin">{ExampleRecyclerViewAdapterKotlin}</CodeBlock>

The following code instantiates a `RecyclerView` and attaches an
`ExampleRecyclerViewAdapter` to display list data in an activity:

<CodeBlock language="kotlin">{RecyclerViewAdapterUsageKotlin}</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">
<CodeBlock language="java">{ExampleRecyclerViewAdapterJava}</CodeBlock>

The following code instantiates a `RecyclerView` and attaches an
`ExampleRecyclerViewAdapter` to display list data in an activity:

<CodeBlock language="java">{RecyclerViewAdapterUsageJava}</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

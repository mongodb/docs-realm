A relationship is an object property that references another Realm object.

Relationships are direct references to other objects in a realm, which
means that you don't need bridge tables or explicit joins to define a
relationship like you would in a relational database. Instead, you can
access related objects by reading and writing to the property that
defines the relationship. Realm Database executes read operations
lazily, so querying objects with relationship fields doesn't have
a performance impact.

There are three primary types of relationships between objects:

- [To-One Relationship](#to-one)
- [To-Many Relationship](#to-many)
- [Inverse Relationship](#inverse)

:::note
In Realm Database, there is no way to limit object references from other
objects within the same realm. As a result, there is no way to restrict
a relationship to "one to one/one to many" instead of
"many to one/many to many".
:::

You can define relationships, collections, and embedded objects in your
object schema using the following types:

- `RealmObject`
- `RealmList <? extends RealmObject>`

Annotations indicate whether a given field represents a foreign
key relationship or an embedded object relationship. For more
information, see [Embedded Objects](/sdk/java/realm-database/schemas/data-types/embedded-objects).

## To-One Relationship {#to-one}

A **to-one** relationship means that an object is related in a specific
way to no more than one other object. Setting a relationship field to
`null` removes the connection between objects, but Realm Database does
not delete the referenced object unless that object is embedded.

To set up a many-to-one or one-to-one relationship, create a field
whose type is a Realm object in your application:

<Tabs groupId="java-sdk-languages">
  <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
    <CodeBlock language="kotlin">{ToOneKotlin}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
    <CodeBlock language="java">{ToOneJava}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Each `Frog` references either zero `Frog` instances or one other
`Frog` instance. Nothing prevents multiple `Frog` instances from
referencing the same `Frog` as a best friend; the distinction between a
many-to-one and a one-to-one relationship is up to your application.

## To-Many Relationship {#to-many}

A **to-many** relationship means that an object is related in a specific
way to multiple objects. You can create a relationship between one object
and any number of objects using a field of type `RealmList<?>`
where `T` is a Realm object in your application:

<Tabs groupId="java-sdk-languages">
  <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
    <CodeBlock language="kotlin">{ToManyKotlin}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
    <CodeBlock language="java">{ToManyJava}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

`RealmList`s are containers of `RealmObject`s, but otherwise behave
like a regular collection. The same object can occur in multiple
to-many relationships; the distinction between a
many-to-many and a one-to-many relationship is up to your application.

## Inverse Relationship {#inverse}

An **inverse relationship** links an object back to any other objects
that refer to it in a to-one or to-many relationship. You must
explicitly define a property in the object's model as an inverse
relationship.

For example, the to-many relationship "Person has many Dogs" does not
automatically create the inverse relationship "Dog belongs to Person". If
you don't specify the inverse relationship in the object model, you
would need to run a separate query to look up the person that that owns
a specific dog.

Realm Database automatically updates implicit relationships whenever an
object is added or removed in the specified relationship. You cannot
manually set the value of an inverse relationship property.

Fields annotated with `@LinkingObjects` must be:

- marked `final`
- of type `RealmResults<T>` where `T` is the type at the opposite
  end of the relationship

Since relationships are many-to-one or many-to-many, following inverse
relationships can result in zero, one, or many objects.

Like any other `RealmResults` set, you can query an inverse relationship.

To define an inverse relationship, define a `LinkingObjects` property
in your object model. The `LinkingObjects` definition specifies the
object type and property name of the relationship that it inverts.

Consider the following class defining a `Toad` with a list of
`frogFriends`:

<Tabs groupId="java-sdk-languages">
  <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
    <CodeBlock language="kotlin">{InverseToadKotlin}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
    <CodeBlock language="java">{InverseToadJava}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can provide a link in the opposite direction, from `Frog` to `Toad`,
with the [`@LinkingObjects`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/sdk/java/api/io/realm/annotations/LinkingObjects/)
annotation on a `final` (in Java) or `val` (in Kotlin) field of type
`RealmResults<T>`:

<Tabs groupId="java-sdk-languages">
  <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
    <CodeBlock language="kotlin">{InverseFrogKotlin}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
    <CodeBlock language="java">{InverseFrogJava}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::important Mark Inverse Properties as Final
Inverse relationship properties must use the `final` modifier.

title: Realm Database
---

Realm Database is a reactive, object-oriented, cross-platform, mobile
database:

- **Reactive**: query the current state of data and subscribe to state
  changes like the result of a query, or even changes to a single
  object.
- **Object-oriented**: organizes data as objects, rather than rows,
  documents, or columns.
- **Cross-platform**: use the same database on iOS, Android, Linux,
  macOS, or Windows. Just define a schema for each SDK you use.
- **Mobile**: designed for the low-power, battery-sensitive, real-time
  environment of a mobile device.

Realm Database is an alternative to
[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) and [Core
Data](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata).

This explanation begins with a deep dive into database internals,
continues with a high-level introduction to some of the features of
Realm Database.

## Database Internals

Realm Database uses a completely unique database engine, file format,
and design. This section describes some of the high-level details of
those choices.

### Native Database Engine

Realm Database is an entire database written from scratch in C++,
instead of building on top of an underlying database engine like SQLite.
Realm Database's underlying storage layer uses [B+
trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%2B_tree) to organize objects. As
a result, Realm Database controls optimizations from the storage level
all the way up to the access level.

Realm Database stores data in **realms**: collections of heterogeneous
realm objects. You can think of each realm as a database. Each object in
a realm is equivalent to a row in a SQL database table or a MongoDB
document. Unlike SQL, realms do not separate different object types into
individual tables.

Realm Database stores objects as groups of property values. We call this
column-based storage. This means that queries or writes for individual
objects can be slower than row-based storage equivalents when unindexed,
but querying a single field across multiple objects or fetching multiple
objects can be much faster due to spatial locality and in-CPU vector
operations.

Realm Database uses a
[zero-copy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-copy) design to make
queries faster than an ORM, and often faster than raw SQLite.

### Realm Files

Realm Database persists data in files saved on device storage. The
database uses several kinds of file:

- **realm files**, suffixed with "realm", e.g. `default.realm`:
  contain object data.
- **lock files**, suffixed with "lock", e.g. `default.realm.lock`:
  keep track of which versions of data in a realm are actively in use.
  This prevents realm from reclaiming storage space that is still used
  by a client application.
- **note files**, suffixed with "note", e.g. `default.realm.note`:
  enable inter-thread and inter-process notifications.
- **management files**, suffixed with "management", e.g.
  `default.realm.management`: internal state management.

Realm files contain object data with the following data structures:
Groups, Tables, Cluster Trees, and Clusters. Realm Database organizes
these data structures into a tree structure with the following form:

- The top level, known as a Group, stores object metadata, a
  transaction log, and a collection of Tables.
- Each class in the realm schema corresponds to a Table within the
  top-level Group.
- Each Table contains a Cluster Tree, an implementation of a B+ tree.
- Leaves on the Cluster Tree are called Clusters. Each contains a
  range of objects sorted by key value.
- Clusters store objects as collections of columns.
- Each column contains data for a single property for multiple
  instances of a given object. Columns are arrays of data with
  uniformly sized values.
- Columns store data in one of the following sizes: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16,
  32, or 64 bits. Each column uses one value size, determined by the
  largest value.

Since pointers refer to memory addresses, objects written to persistent
files cannot store references as pointers. Instead, realm files refer to
data using the offset from the beginning of the file. We call this a
ref. As Realm Database uses memory mapping to read and write data,
database operations translate these refs from offsets to memory pointers
when navigating database structures.

### Copy-on-Write: The Secret Sauce of Data Versioning

Realm Database uses a technique called **copy-on-write**, which copies
data to a new location on disk for every write operation instead of
overwriting older data on disk. Once the new copy of data is fully
written, the database updates existing references to that data. Older
data is only garbage collected when it is no longer referenced or
actively in use by a client application.

Because of copy-on-write, older copies of data remain valid, since all
of the references in those copies still point to other valid data. Realm
Database leverages this fact to offer multiple versions of data
simultaneously to different threads in client applications. Most
applications tie data refreshes to the repaint cycle of the looper
thread that controls the UI, since data only needs to refresh as often
as the UI does. Longer-running procedures on background threads, such as
large write operations, can work with a single version of data for a
longer period of time before committing their changes.

### Memory Mapping

Writes use [memory
mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_file) to avoid
copying data back and forth from memory to storage. Accessors and
mutators read and write to disk via memory mapping. As a result, object
data is never stored on the stack or heap of your app. By default, data
is memory-mapped as read-only to prevent accidental writes.

Realm Database uses operating system level paging, trusting each
operating system to implement memory mapping and persistence better than
a single library could on its own.

### Compaction

Realm Database automatically reuses free space that is no longer needed
after database writes. However, realm files never shrink automatically,
even if the amount of data stored in your realm decreases significantly.
Compact your realm to optimize storage space and decrease file size if
possible.

You should compact your realms occasionally to keep them at an optimal
size. You can do this manually, or by configuring your realms to compact
on launch. However, Realm Database reclaims unused space for future
writes, so compaction is only an optimization to conserve space
on-device.

### ACID Compliance

Realm Database guarantees that transactions are
[ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) compliant.
This means that all committed write operations are
guaranteed to be valid and that clients don't see transient states in
the event of a system crash. Realm Database complies with ACID with the
following design choices:

- [Atomicity](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomicity_(database_systems)>):
  groups operations in transactions and rolls back all operations in a
  transaction if any of them fail.
- [Consistency](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency_(database_systems)>):
  avoids data corruption by validating changes against the schema. If
  the result of any write operation is not valid, Realm cancels and
  rolls back the entire transaction.
- [Isolation](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_(database_systems)>):
  allows only one writer at a time. This ensures thread safety between
  transactions.
- [Durability](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durability_(database_systems)>):
  writes to disk immediately when a transaction is committed. In the
  event of an app crash, for example, changes are not lost or
  corrupted.

## Features

Realm Database supports many popular database features.

### Queries

You can query Realm Database using platform-native queries or a raw
query language that works across platforms.

### Indexes

Indexes are implemented as trees containing values of a given property
instead of a unique internal object key. This means that indexes only
support one column, and thus only one property, at a time.

### Schemas

Every realm object has a schema. That schema is defined via a native
object in your SDK's language. Object schemas can include embedded lists
and relations between object instances.

Each realm uses a versioned schema. When that schema changes, you must
define a migration to move object data between schema versions. Additive
schema changes happen automatically, but your SDK may require you to
increase the local schema version to begin using the updated schema in
your app. Destructive changes require a migration function. See your
SDK's documentation for more information on migrations.

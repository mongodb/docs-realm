# Realm Web Test Repo

Tests and code examples for the [Realm Web SDK (realm-web)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/realm-web).

This repo is based on the [Create React App TypeScript template](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/).

## Set up

Set up the project by installing the npm packages:

```sh
yarn
```

You may also want to change the project's Realm app for testing functionality of
Realm App Services. You can change the `APP_ID` in `src/realm.config.json` to the
Realm app that you want to work with.

## Test

Tests are in the `src/__test__` directory.

Run tests with the command:

```sh
yarn test
```

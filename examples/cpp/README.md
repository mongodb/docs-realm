# Realm CPP Examples

This project contains code examples for the Realm C++ SDK and their unit and UI tests.

The first time you set up the project, run through **First-time Setup**.

When you're already set up but you have edited source code, start with
**Build the Project**.

If you just want to run the tests, go to **Run the Tests**.

The Flexible Sync backend that this app hits is the [cpp-tester App Services app in the Realm Example Testers Atlas project of the Bushicorp Atlas Organization](https://realm.mongodb.com/groups/5f60207f14dfb25d23101102/apps/6388f860cb722c5a5e002425/dashboard)

## First-time Setup

The project uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) to create build files (Makefile, .xcodeproj...) for the
project. To check if you have CMake installed run:

```shell
cmake
```

If you do have CMake installed, you should see the help documentation in your terminal. If
you don't, you can install CMake with brew or by downloading it directly from CMake.

```shell
brew install cmake
```

Run CMake in a gitignored directory, such as `build`, to generate build
configurations that you can then use to compile your app. If this is the
first time you're setting up the project, you'll need to make a `build`
directory.

```shell
# build/ is in .gitignore
mkdir build
cd build
```

## Build the Project

From `/examples/cpp/build`, run `cmake` to create a Makefile by reading
`CMakeLists.txt` in the parent directory.

```shell
cmake ../
```

Use `ls` to see that a Makefile has been generated. Then, build the app:

```shell
make
```

The first time you run `make`, the process will take some time because it's
doing a full build. On subsequent runs, `make` does incremental builds, so
rebuilding will be faster.

When the build is complete, `ls` should reveal an `examples` executable
at the root of the `build` directory.

## Run the Tests

To run the tests, execute the `examples` file from the `build` directory:

```shell
./examples
```

### How to Skip Tests

You can exclude tests from your test run. To exclude tests, pass a flag that
contains the tag or tags you want to exclude when you run the tests:

```shell
./examples ~[sync]
```

This requires us to tag every example consistently. For example, tag examples
using sync with the `sync` tag. When you create a new test case, you can specify
one or more tags for the test. For example, in the following test case declaration,
the tags are `realm` and `sync`:

```cpp
TEST_CASE("open a synced realm", "[realm][sync]")
```

## Update the Realm SDK Version

CMakeLists.txt has a FetchContent block that pulls in the `realm-cpp` repository
code as a dependency, and compiles it:

```shell
FetchContent_Declare(
  cpprealm
  GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/realm/realm-cpp.git
  GIT_TAG        f4f89d1c75d4c762a679f57d2e9f26e87ec1215b
)
```

To change the version of the SDK we use in the build, change the value
of the `GIT_TAG`. While in pre-Alpha, this is a commit hash, but it will
likely be a version tag once the SDK starts doing tagged releases. For more
information, refer to the
[FetchContent Module docs](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html).

For best results, when changing the SDK version, delete everything in the
`build` directory. Then, create a new Makefile and build the project again
before running the tests.

From `/examples/cpp/build`, run `cmake` to create a Makefile by reading
`CMakeLists.txt` in the parent directory.

```shell
cmake ../
```

You can `ls` to see that a Makefile has been generated. Then, build the app:

```shell
make
```

## Add a New Test File

To add a new test file, create a file with a `.cpp` extension in `examples/cpp/`.
For example, `my-new-test-file.cpp`.

Include the relevant headers. They probably look something like:

```cpp
#include <catch2/catch_test_macros.hpp>
#include <cpprealm/sdk.hpp>
```

Write the test code.

Open `CMakeLists.txt` file. Find the `add_executable` function.
Add the new file name to the appropriate spot in the alphabetical list of files.
For example:

```txt
add_executable(examplesm
  asymmetric-sync.cpp
  crud.cpp
  my-new-test-file.cpp
  notifications.cpp
)
```

To verify your new test file works, [build the project](https://github.com/mongodb/docs-realm/tree/master/examples/cpp#build-the-project)
again and then [run the tests](https://github.com/mongodb/docs-realm/tree/master/examples/cpp#run-the-tests) again.

## Add a New Example

Find the relevant test case file for the section or category you wish to write
an example for.

Define a new `TEST_CASE`. This should have a unique string name - as in the
example below `"add a dog object to a realm"`, and a tag that designates it
as part of a relevant group of tests. In the example below, the test is tagged
with `"[write]"`.

To enable us to run a group of tests, or exclude a group of tests, use
relevant tags when creating new test cases. For example, tests that use
Device Sync could be tagged with `"[sync]"` so we can easily skip them or
run them specifically, depending on what we're testing.

```cpp
TEST_CASE("add a dog object to a realm", "[write]") {
    auto dog = Dog { .name = "Floof", .age = 3 };

    std::cout << "dog: " << dog << "\n";

    auto realm = realm::open<Person, Dog>();

    realm.write([&realm, &dog] {
        realm.add(dog);
    });
}
```

To verify your new example works, from the `/build` directory, run `make`and then
[run the tests](https://github.com/mongodb/docs-realm/tree/master/examples/cpp#run-the-tests)
again.

## Build and Run for Xcode

If you want to use Xcode for breakpoints and debugging, you can build
the project to run in Xcode.

From the `/build` directory, run CMake with a `-G Xcode` flag:

```shell
cmake ../ -G Xcode
```

If you have previously run `CMake` for this project, you may see this error:

```shell
CMake Error: Error: generator : Xcode
Does not match the generator used previously: Unix Makefiles
Either remove the CMakeCache.txt file and CMakeFiles directory or choose a different binary directory.
```

To address this error, you can run `cmake ../ -G Xcode` from a clean build directory,
create a new subdirectory for xcode (`/build/xcode`), or remove the files specified
in the error.

On a successful build, you should see `examples.xcodeproj` in the directory
Xcode builds to.

Open the project in Xcode.

Inside the project, you'll see all the linked files, but the source files
for the examples are located in:

`examples/Source Files`

To build and run these source files in Xcode, select the `examples` executable
target and press the `Start` (â–¶) button. You should see the results and any
print output in the console.

The React Native SDKs docs testing suite is dvided into two directories: legacy and v12.

Tests in the legacy directory use versions of Realm.js before Realm.js v12.0.0. Tests in the v12 directory use Realm.js v12.0.0 and later.

There are many reasons for splitting the directories, but the largest is a shift in testing philosophy. You can learn more about that in the v12 directory's README file.
